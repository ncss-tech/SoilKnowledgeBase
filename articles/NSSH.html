</h3>
<p>A. The three principal publications guiding the NCSS are the Soil Survey Manual, "Soil Taxonomy," and the National Soil Survey Handbook. Part 600, subpart B, section 600.10, lists other technical references that are important in gathering and applying soil knowledge. The following paragraphs describe how these publications are revised and how they apply to the NCSS in the United States.</p>
<p>B. The Soil Survey Manual</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The purpose of Agriculture Handbook 18, the Soil Survey Manual, is to provide the major principles and concepts for making and using soil surveys and the standards and conventions for describing soils. The manual is intended primarily for use by soil scientists engaged in making and interpreting soil surveys. It is also the basic reference for soil survey users who desire to learn the scientific methods that form the basis for soil surveys. It discusses general procedures to illustrate and explain the principles and concepts, but the National Soil Survey Handbook presents current operational procedures of NRCS in more detail.(2) Amendments may be issued to the Soil Survey Manual as NRCS directives. Proposals to amend the manual may originate from any interested individual or group participating in the NCSS or from staffs of foreign soil survey organizations. The originating group or author forwards the proposal to the national leader for soil survey standards.</li>
</ol>
<p>C. "Soil Taxonomy" and "Keys to Soil Taxonomy" Agriculture Handbook 436, second edition (1999), "Soil Taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys," provides the common base for the organization of knowledge about soils and the standards for their classification. "Keys to Soil Taxonomy," which is periodically revised, provides excerpts of "Soil Taxonomy" that can be readily used in the field and contains all the approved revisions and amendments to "Soil Taxonomy." Procedures to amend "Soil Taxonomy" are outlined in part 614 of this handbook.</p>
<p>D. The National Soil Survey Handbook</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Unlike manuals in eDirectives, which "issue policies and procedures on a specific subject," the National Soil Survey Handbook provides guidelines, definitions, responsibilities, and how-to procedures for conducting the NRCS part of the NCSS (Title 120, National Directives Management Manual (NDMM)). It contains information relative to planning and managing soil surveys, collecting and maintaining soil survey information, and distributing the information to users. The National Soil Survey Handbook provides specific information about the field activities, correlation, interpretation, publication, and dissemination of soil surveys of the NCSS.</p></li>
<li><p>The National Soil Survey Center updates the National Soil Survey Handbook on a periodic basis. Any member of the NCSS may suggest changes or additions to the handbook. The originating author sends the proposed changes or additions, along with an explanation of and support for the need for the change or addition, to the national leader for soil survey standards at the National Soil Survey Center. The center reviews proposed changes, amendments, and additions at least annually. The director of the Soil Science Division issues approved amendments and notifies users of the National Soil Survey Handbook. This handbook is not to be amended or supplemented by regional or local offices.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>E. User Manuals User manuals contain procedures for conducting soil survey activities, such as those related to the electronic storage and display of soil information. Examples are the user guides for the National Soil Information System.</p>
<p>F. Guides Guides provide special information and criteria for various functions, such as interpreting soils and updating major land resource areas. Regional guides may be developed and used as needed to supplement national guides.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="conventions-and-terminology">600.4 Conventions and Terminology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conventions-and-terminology"></a>
</h3>
<p>The following are conventions and terminology used in the National Soil Survey Handbook. Unless otherwise stated, all information provided herein are standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Policy.-A principle to be followed to guide decisions to achieve a desired outcome. Policy differs from procedure or protocol in that a policy contains the "what" and the "why" only. Procedures or protocols also include the "what," "how," "where," and "when." Policies are determined and adopted by the Chief and may be delegated to other senior staff within NRCS. Protocols and procedures are developed by the senior managers to implement policy. Title 130, General Manual, Part 407, "National Policy," states that policies are adopted to ensure- (i) Conformance to laws and rules. (ii) Implementation of Executive orders and other Executive direction. (iii) Program quality control. (iv) Accountability. (v) Quality, consistency, and coordination in products and services.</p></li>
<li><p>Standard.-An established requirement defining technical criteria, methods, processes, or practices that must be accomplished or adhered to in order to ensure mission objectives are being met. Soil survey standards include sets of definitions and specifications. The definitions are standardized to ensure that everyone is using terminology that has the same meaning. Standards ensure consistency and repeatability of field procedures and analytical procedures so that soil surveys meet user needs and processes are repeatable in all locations. Standards may also apply to the results or performance of the soil survey information and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Procedure.-An established or official step-by-step set of instructions for completing a task.</p></li>
<li><p>Protocol.-Mandatory steps or a system of rules that detail the correct conduct and procedures to be followed in formal situations to ensure policy is adhered to. An example of this would be the process for amending the National Soil Survey Handbook.</p></li>
<li><p>Process.-Chronological set of linked steps or actions for accomplishing a task.</p></li>
<li><p>Guideline.-Any document that aims to streamline particular processes according to a set routine. By definition, following a guideline is never mandatory. Guidelines are an essential part of the larger process of governance. They may be issued and used by an organization to make the actions of its employees or divisions more predictable and, presumably, of higher quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Method.-An established means for completing an action. There may be more than one method available to accomplish a task.</p></li>
<li><p>Exhibit.-An example, typically showing a completed product. Exhibits do not imply that protocols, policy, or standards were followed unless explicitly stated that such is the case. (An exhibit may be an example of what not to do.)</p></li>

<h3 id="standards-of-the-national-cooperative-soil-survey">600.5 Standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#standards-of-the-national-cooperative-soil-survey"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. The procedures and guidance (a.k.a., "standards") used in the Soil Survey Program are dynamic and may change. Standards are critical to the success of developing and delivering accurate and consistent soil survey information to the public.</p>
<p>B. Standards are a set of rules or criteria. They serve as the metric to determine if mission objectives are being met. Standards may take on a number of forms and be developed in a number of ways. Soil survey standards include sets of definitions and specifications. The definitions are standardized to ensure everyone is using terminology that has the same meaning. Standards apply to the use of specific processes, procedures, or methodologies in order ensure consistency and repeatability of field procedures and analytical procedures. They can also apply to the results or performance of the soil survey information and data. Many of the standards used by the NCSS are applied nationally and internationally by the soil science discipline.</p>
<p>C. Soil survey standards should convey requirements clearly and concisely. For standards to be meaningful, they must be written, maintained, and readily available to reference and they must be followed in conducting and delivering soil survey products. Specific rules are followed in the development, modification, and maintenance of standards. Soil survey standards are managed and maintained by the Soil Survey Standards Branch at the National Soil Survey Center. Requests for changes or additions in soil survey standards should be directed to the national leader for soil survey standards.</p>
<p>D. The flowchart in part 600, subpart B, section 600.11, shows the steps that guide revision of the National Soil Survey Handbook (120-NDMM).</p>

<p>A. The National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) is a nationwide partnership of Federal, regional, State, and local agencies and private entities and institutions. This partnership works to cooperatively investigate, inventory, document, classify, interpret, disseminate, and publish information about soils of the United States and its trust territories and commonwealths. The activities of the NCSS are carried out on national, regional (such as the major land resource area, or MLRA), and State levels.</p>
<p>B. NRCS is responsible for the leadership of soil survey activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for the leadership and coordination of NCSS activities, and for the extension of soil survey technology to global applications. Additional information about the Soil Survey Program is in the NRCS general manual (<a href="http://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/RollupViewer.aspx?hid=16988" class="external-link uri">http://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/RollupViewer.aspx?hid=16988</a>) under Title 430, Part 402.</p>
<p>C. Primary Federal agency NCSS participants include the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Department of Defense (DoD), Forest Service (FS), National Park Service (NPS), and NRCS. Part 601, subpart B, section 601.10, has a short description of the roles of these partners. In addition to these Federal agency partners, there are numerous State and local partners participating in the NCSS. Information about the organization and responsibilities of partner agencies is contained in their policy documents.</p>

<h3 id="primary-federal-partners">601.10 Primary Federal Partners<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#primary-federal-partners"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. This subpart provides brief descriptions of the roles of the five primary Federal partners in NCSS. Descriptions were prepared in 2006 by representatives of each agency. The most current information is contained in each agency's own policy documents.</p>
<p>B. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) BIA is the primary contact for soil surveys on the 93.7 million acres of Native American lands. Soil surveys are primarily at 1:24,000 scale to support decision-making processes for land management. Soil surveys are needed for farming, community planning, land development, and grazing and forest management. Soil survey and ecological site data are necessary for land health assessments, grazing permit renewal, energy and mineral permitting and leasing, restoration of natural fire processes, restoration of the health of the land, maintenance of clean water and air, and invasive plant control. Soil information is fundamental in assessing soil capabilities, limitations, and vulnerability to degradation and loss of capacity so that the health of the land can be sustained. Because Native American lands are considered private lands, NRCS has the responsibility to complete soil surveys on Native American lands. Soil surveys are completed in conjunction with BIA soil scientists and other staff.</p>
<p>C. Bureau of Land Management (BLM)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>BLM manages approximately 261 million acres of public land, located primarily in 12 western States. The mission of BLM is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of public land for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations. BLM-administered land include a diverse mosaic of grassland, shrub land, forest, desert, and arctic and alpine ecosystems on extensive landscapes that range from nearly level playas to steep, rugged mountains. These landscapes and ecosystems contain a wide variety of soils with diverse properties that can significantly affect use and management. BLM manages a wide variety of resources and uses, including energy and minerals, livestock forage, fish and wildlife habitat, timber, wild horse and burro populations, watershed values, wilderness and recreation areas, and cultural and other natural heritage values. BLM administers public land within a framework of numerous laws and regulations, including FLPMA, NEPA, and State water- quality laws. Soils are one of the most fundamental natural resources on public land. Soils sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the land. Soil quality and health are the driving forces that determine these factors.</p></li>
<li><p>Soil surveys are primarily at 1:24,000 scale to support decision-making processes for land management. Soil survey and ecological site data are necessary for rangeland health assessments, grazing permit renewal, energy and mineral permitting and leasing, restoration of natural fire processes, restoration of the health of the land, maintenance of clean water and air, and invasive plant control. Soil information is fundamental in assessing soil capabilities, limitations, and vulnerability to degradation and loss of capacity so that the health of the land can be sustained. The information and interpretations provided in soil surveys are helpful in managing all activities on public land that disturb the soil. Most soil and ecological mapping on public land has been accomplished through reimbursable agreements with NRCS.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Department of Defense (DoD)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>DoD manages about 50 million acres and is divided into five main agencies. The Army has about 17 million acres of mission land, the Air Force has about 9 million acres, the Navy has about 2 million acres, the Marine Corps has about 1 million acres, and the Army Corps of Engineers has about 15 million acres. The remainder is divided up by smaller agencies.</p></li>
<li><p>DoD has two missions on its installations. The first mission is to train soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors in conditions as close as possible to those under which they may have to fight. The second mission is to manage the conservation of natural resources. Managing the conservation of natural resources allows for the first mission.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sikes Act, as amended, requires each component service (Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) to have an integrated natural resources management plan (INRMP) for each installation and training site that has significant natural resources. The INRMP describes the installation's natural resources and its management strategy for sustaining them while supporting the installation's military mission.</p></li>
<li><p>Each service's natural resources management implementing guidelines require a soil planning-level survey as part of an installation's INRMP. A soil planning-level survey is equivalent to an NCSS soil survey product at an order-2 level of detail. Each service either names NRCS as the source from which to obtain soils data or requires that the soil survey be done according to NCSS standards and procedures. Each installation's mission normally dictates the level of detail needed. The Army's standard is a 1:12,000-scale soil survey to support installations where millions of miles are used for land-intensive mission training, including vehicle use (from ATVs to main battle tanks). On installations that DoD is closing, those involved in clean-up efforts often require order-2 soil surveys to understand the effects of chemicals and constituents of concern and how to safely manage their transport. Installations that need a soil survey enter into an agreement with NRCS through the SSRs in which the installation is located. At the installation's request, the soil survey may be restricted from public access due to national security concerns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>E. Forest Service (FS)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The national forests (formerly called forest reserves) originated with the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, which allowed the President to establish forest reserves from timber-covered public domain land. National forests and grasslands encompass 193 million acres of land. There are 155 national forests and 20 grasslands. Congress established the Forest Service to provide quality water and timber for the Nation's benefit. The Forest Service manages national forests for multiple uses (including recreation) and benefits and for the sustained yield of renewable resources such as water, forage, wildlife, and wood. Managing for multiple uses means managing resources under the best combination of uses to benefit the American people while ensuring the productivity of the land and protecting the quality of the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The National Forest System uses soil resource inventories and terrestrial ecological unit inventories to develop land and resource management plans as well as project plans. The Forest Service pursues an ecological approach to land stewardship. This approach has increased the need for soil resource inventories to collect and classify vegetation data in conjunction with progressive inventories. Soil surveys in the eastern United States have been completed primarily through agreements with NRCS. In the western States, soil surveys are typically completed by Forest Service staff.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>F. National Park Service (NPS)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>NPS is the steward for natural resources on nearly 85 million acres of public land. Management policies and guidelines for soil resource management are contained in NPS-77, Natural Resources Management. The NPS management policies state: "The NPS will actively seek to understand and preserve the soil resources of parks and to prevent, to the extent possible, the unnatural erosion, physical removal, or contamination of the soil, or its contamination of other resources." The NPS Soil Inventory and Monitoring Program uses the appropriate detailed geospatial soil databases to define the distribution of soil types; determine their physical, chemical, and biological characteristics; provide interpretations needed to assess soil capabilities, limitations, and vulnerabilities to degradation; promote a soil conservation ethic; and support soil resources management, vital signs monitoring, ecological restoration activities, and agency decisions on the development of facilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Soil management objectives are to- (i) Preserve intact, functioning, natural systems by preserving native soils and the processes of soil genesis in a condition undisturbed by humans. (ii) Maintain significant cultural objects and scenes by conserving soils in a manner consistent with the associated historic practices and by minimizing soil erosion to the extent possible. (iii) Protect property and provide safety by ensuring that developments and their management take into account soil limitations, behavior, and hazards. (iv) Minimize soil loss and disturbance caused by special use activities and ensure that soils retain their productivity and potential for reclamation. NPS typically works with NRCS, through interagency agreements, to support soil survey crews, which map NPS lands as well as refine or develop ecological site descriptions to meet agency needs.</p></li>

<p>A. According to the NRCS General Manual, Title 430, Part 402, "The National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) is a nationwide partnership of Federal, regional, State, and local agencies; private entities; and institutions that cooperatively inventory, investigate, classify, interpret, disseminate, and maintain information about the soils of the United States and its trust territories and commonwealths. The cooperators promote the understanding and appropriate use of soil information. NRCS provides leadership for the NCSS." The NCSS coordinates technically and operationally at national, regional, and State levels. Its activities relate to the technology for the collection, management, and presentation of information about the properties, patterns, and responses of soils and to other joint concerns, such as training and coordinated research and operations. Workshops, meetings, and conferences at each level resolve concerns and address proposals and recommendations for the cooperative soil survey (see also part 601, subpart A, section 601.0 of this handbook).</p>
<p>B. The National Cooperative Soil Survey Conference The national conference primarily discusses subjects of national concern to NCSS. The Soil and Plant Science Division director calls the conference in odd-numbered years after consulting with the conference steering committee. NRCS publishes the proceedings of the conference and distributes copies to the cooperators in NCSS. The conference bylaws specify the objectives, membership, and committees. Refer to part 602, subpart B, section 602.10, for the bylaws of the NCSS Conference. Guidance on conducting NCSS conferences is provided in section 602.15.</p>
<p>C. NCSS Regional Conferences The NCSS regional conferences primarily discuss subjects of regional concern. Each region convenes a soil survey conference in even-numbered years. The four regions correspond to the agricultural experiment station regions and are the North Central, Northeast, Southern, and Western. The conference steering committee publishes the conference proceedings and distributes copies to regional NCSS cooperators and others. The conference bylaws specify the objectives, membership, and committee responsibilities. Refer to part 602, subpart B, sections 602.11, 602.12, 602.13, and 602.14, for the bylaws of the four NCSS regional conferences. Guidance on conducting NCSS conferences is provided in section 602.15.</p>
<p>D. NCSS State Conferences The NCSS State conferences primarily discuss subjects of State concern. The NRCS State soil scientist annually convenes a State conference. Attendees include cooperators and others who contribute to NCSS activities and principal users of soil survey information within the State. Working agreements govern activities of NCSS within the State.</p>
<p>E. Joint Regional or State Conferences Joint regional or State conferences between two or more regions or States may be held with the agreement of the participants involved.</p>

Some committees are continued from the previous conference. Permanent or standing committees, ad hoc committees, and task force groups are considered to be committees of the conference. The conference has standing committees on: standards, research priorities, new technology, interpretations, and soil and ecosystem dynamics. These standing committees communicate with their corresponding standing committee of the National Cooperative Soil Survey Conference. Section 2. The committee chair selects a secretary, or recorder. Committee members are selected after considering steering committee recommendations, national conference recommendations, individual interests, technical proficiency, and continuity of the work. They are not limited to members of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Section 3. Each committee commonly conducts its work by correspondence among committee members. Most of the committee's communications are by correspondence. Copies of all correspondence among members of the steering committee are sent to each member of the committee. Committee chairs provide their committee members with the charges as assigned by the steering committee and procedure for committee operation. Committee chairs are charged with responsibility for initiating and carrying forward this work. Chairs should initiate committee work at the earliest possible date. Each committee meets during the conference and permits other conference attendees to have input into each committee's activities. Section 4. Each committee chair sends copies of a final committee report to the secretary within 30 days after the conference. Section 5. The chairs or representatives of the five standing committees are expected to participate in the corresponding standing committee of the National Cooperative Soil Survey Conference and are expected to attend the next national conference. Their role is to ensure that concerns of the regional standing committee are communicated to the corresponding national standing committee and that information from the national committee is communicated back to the regional committee. Article VII. Representation to the National Soil Survey Conference Voting members of the National Cooperative Soil Survey Conference include the national leader for Soil Survey Research and Laboratory of the Soil and Plant Science Division and a NCERA-3 (State) delegate from the current host State for the NCRSSC. The NCERA-3 representative also serves on the steering committee for the NCSSC. Two additional delegates to the NCSSC include one NRCS soil scientist and one NCERA-3 (State) representative (with appropriate administrative approval). The NRCS soil scientist is chosen by simple majority vote during the separate Federal session. The second NCERA-3 delegate comes from the next NCRSSC host State and is assigned the task of presenting the NCRSSC report at the NCSSC. Both NCERA-3 delegates are chosen by simple majority vote during the separate NCERA-3 session at the NCRSSC. Article VIII.

</h3>
<p>Communication within and between the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) regional and national conferences is essential. If the conferences are to remain an effective means of conducting business, and all partners are to be afforded effective means to contribute, then direction is needed on how communications happen within the conferences. Steering committees and liaisons should coordinate with committee chairs to help ensure that meeting time is allocated appropriately among important conference activities, including working sessions for standing and ad hoc committees, updates, information exchange, and field trips. Meeting conference objectives requires coordination and continued feedback from the membership and from regular, ongoing work committees throughout the year. Timely execution of planning efforts for regional and national conferences is necessary to ensure participation in the preconference activity. Coordination Activities The Soil and Plant Science Division director assigns a liaison to each of the regional conferences and may be chosen from any NCSS member. The role of the liaison is to help ensure good communication between the regional and national conferences. Activities that can help accomplish this goal include: ensuring all steering committee members are familiar with the specific guidance given in the regional conference bylaws, helping the steering committee develop the agenda for the regional conference and adequately address issues of concern from the past national conference or current national committee deliberations, and helping ensure that all issues from regional conferences are identified in the conference report and that the report is presented and/or made available to participants at the next national conference. The chair of each regional standing committee should attend the next national conference to ensure that issues of concern raised in regional committee deliberations are reported to the national conference and to provide clarification and counsel to the national committee regarding those issues. This individual should also ensure that discussions of the national committee are well understood during deliberations of the regional committee during the year following the national conference. The regional steering committee, with the assistance of the assigned liaison, should ensure that the issues raised by any regional ad hoc committee are directed to all appropriate members of the national conference and that feedback is directed to the ad hoc committee so that committee members are aware of the disposition of their concern. Regional standing and adhoc committee chairs will provide a report to members of the national conference steering committee and the chair of each of the national standing committees or related national conference personnel as follows: within 30 days of the end of the regional conference, 90 days before the next national conference, and within 90 days of the next regional conference. In addition, any individual who has responsibility for a subject matter addressed as an item of concern or a recommendation should be provided a copy. The reports are presented at conference committee meetings. To meet NCSS objectives, it is critical to have continuity from one conference to the next. The Timeline of Activities facilitates continuity. Timeline of Activities Conference date Activity minus 23 months Steering committee and committee chairs provide reports, including names of the new committee chairs and vice-chairs, to the Soil and Plant Science Division for posting on the NCSS website, and to the national conference liaisons for communication to the corresponding national or regional committees. Executive Services staff distribute bylaws to incoming committee chairs and vice-chairs. 22 months Soil and Plant Science Division publishes proceedings on conference websites. Committee chairs solicit new committee members through the NCSS. 20 months Committees convene to review objectives and charges as assigned based on prior conference proceedings and recommendations. Committees set meetings as needed to discuss and accomplish charges and to prepare reports for the intervening regional or national conferences. The steering committee meets to review recommendations and assess further action. 15 months Committees submit mid-term report to the intervening regional or national conference committees; report is published on the NCSS website and in the NCSS newsletter. 12 months Conference steering committee begins holding planning meetings monthly, or more frequently if needed. 9 months Conference, including dates and location, is announced by posting on the NCSS website and sending information to member lists. 6 months Committees meet to review intervening meeting proceedings and begin drafting recommendations. 3 months Committee chairs submit draft reports to steering committee for distribution to NCSS members. Requests for new committee vice-chair nominations are solicited. At conference Committee reports are presented during committee meetings. Report recommendations are submitted to the business meeting for discussion. Committee vice-chairs are chosen by the committees and names are submitted to the business meeting.</p>

<p>Working agreements are a basis of understanding for cooperative work with other agencies and organizations. These agreements include memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and reimbursable agreements. NRCS or any public agency may initiate working agreements relating to soil survey and ecological site activities. If another Federal agency initiates a working agreement, the name of the document and the format may be different from those used by NRCS. Cooperators operate within their own sphere of authority. Title 120, General Manual, Part 401, provides policy guidelines on agreements. An MOU is not a contract, and the plans and specifications agreed upon and contained therein are not legally binding for the agencies that sign it. The MOU may provide for other working agreements, such as cooperative agreements or interagency agreements, for transfer of funds, services, space, or equipment.</p>

<p>This part of the National Soil Survey Handbook (NSSH) is focused on initial soil surveys. In rare cases, existing soil surveys require such extensive revision that complete remapping is required. The extensive revision of non-MLRA soil survey areas has been phased out and replaced with the process of updating map units on an MLRA basis. Updating soil surveys is addressed in part 610 of this handbook. The purpose of initial soil survey preparation is to ensure the efficient use of staff time and equipment and to meet the intent of the soil survey. The preparations help the soil survey office staff understand the intent and specifications detailed in the memorandum of understanding (MOU) and the specific timeline and deliverables detailed in the plan of operation.</p>

</h3>
<p>A. The MLRA Regionwide MOU The MLRA regionwide MOU outlines technical standards and responsibilities of cooperators within the soil survey region and is applicable to initial soil survey projects being conducted within the region.</p>
<p>B. The Soil Survey Project Long-Range Plan The soil survey project long-range plan (along with the project soil survey area MOU, if one is used) specifies the deliverables and sets the time period for the completion of the soil survey. The time period specified for an initial soil survey project is recorded in the NASIS "Legend" table. Although initial soil surveys are planned and organized to complete a defined soil survey area, these survey areas are essentially a subset of the MLRA soil survey area and need to be managed within that larger physiographic context. Initial soil survey projects are scheduled for completion within about a 5-year period. Staffing should correspond to this scheduled completion period. If estimated completion time of an initial soil survey project is more than about 5 years, staffing should be reconsidered or the project should be subdivided into more manageable areas.</p>
<p>C. The State Soil Scientist The State soil scientist fosters relationships with the cooperators in the project and provides input on the technical soil survey needs of the area.</p>
<p>D. The Soil Survey Regional Office The soil survey regional office (SSRO) provides technical support and guidance for conducting the survey in a coordinated fashion within the MLRA soil survey region. It also provides quality assurance as the project progresses (see part 609 for more information).</p>
<p>E. The Soil Survey Office The soil survey office (SSO) is responsible for- (i) Reviewing the MLRA regionwide MOU and the soil survey area MOU (if applicable). (ii) Preparing both long-range and annual plans of operation to complete the initial soil survey project. (iii) Preparing and indexing the base maps (options may include contact prints of aerial photos, digital orthophoto quadrangle images for on-screen digitizing, etc.). (iv) Collecting and reviewing reference material, including digital data analysis. (v) Acquiring and assembling equipment. (vi) Making preliminary field studies. (vii) Preparing an initial descriptive legend based on the field studies. (viii) Initiating the collection of soil performance data to support soil interpretations. (ix) Ensuring that map unit design meets program needs. (x) Preparing to perform progressive correlation in a manner that ensures that the initial soil survey project is coordinated with the overall MLRA soil survey project.</p>

<h3 id="preliminary-survey-activities">607.2 Preliminary Survey Activities<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preliminary-survey-activities"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. MOU and the Long-Range Plan</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>After the soil survey field staff has gained some familiarity with the survey area, the MLRA regionwide MOU, the long-range plan, and the local MOU are reviewed jointly with the soil survey regional office, the State soil scientist, the line officer representing the lead agency, and representatives from each major cooperator. The following items are reviewed: (i) Survey objectives and specifications (ii) The role and function of each cooperating agency (iii) The mapping base suitability in relation to landforms and soil complexity of the area (iv) Interpretation needs for regulations and programs (v) Needs for laboratory and soil investigations for soil classification and soil interpretations (vi) Adequacy of plans to digitize, map finish, and electronically publish (vii) Any directive to restrict information deemed to be sensitive to national security (see part 606, section 606.1, of this handbook)</p></li>
<li><p>If changes are needed later, the soil survey regional director or the appropriate supervisor of the lead agency is notified. If the soil survey regional director and appropriate supervisor concur, the long-range plan and, where applicable, the MOU for the survey area are amended as outlined in part 606, section 606.1B, of this handbook. The board of advisors for the MLRA soil survey region, or similar management body as applicable, is consulted as necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>B. Preparation of Aerial Photo Field Sheets (if used) Use of digital map base materials is preferred because of their inherent efficiencies, but in some cases paper copies of aerial photo field sheets are used. (i) The field sheets are properly identified to aid in their use and to ensure recovery of the sheets if they are lost. If NRCS is the lead agency, each field sheet displays the following information: - USDA, NRCS, and the full names of the cooperating agencies - The total acreage of the soil survey area on the field sheet - The soil survey area name and State and the field sheet number - The names of the soil scientists who mapped the sheet and the date that the field sheet was completed - The telephone number of the soil survey office - The email address of the MLRA soil survey leader (ii) The note "ADVANCE COPY SUBJECT TO CHANGE," the name of the soil survey area, the field sheet number, a bar scale, and a north arrow are placed on the front of all field sheets distributed to users.</p>
<p>C. Preparation of Digital Data Mapping Base</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The NRCS, Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, or other lead agency identifies and acquires the appropriate spatial data layers necessary to create and maintain a soils map digitally. Responsibilities include- (i) Locating sources and obtaining geospatial data for production soil survey. (ii) Checking for correct spatial data extent (location). (iii) Reviewing metadata for usability. (iv) Processing and preparing the digital spatial data layers using appropriate map projections and file format conversions. When available, all digital layers should have the same- - Coordinate system - Quality standards - Portable format - Scale</p></li>
<li><p>The soil survey regional office provides guidance on the appropriate procedures to be used to ensure consistency in developing the geodatabase, naming and archiving files, and performing quality assurance activities. See part 607, subpart B, section 607.11, for an example.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Reference Material Reference material is gathered, reviewed, and summarized before the preliminary fieldwork begins. The kinds of reference material that may be available and useful are listed in part 607, subpart B, section 607.10. Sources of reference material are as follows: (i) The U.S. Department of the Interior, Geological Survey, and State geological surveys or comparable State agencies with other names (ii) The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agriculture Statistics Service (iii) The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service (iv) The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service (v) The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (vi) The U.S. Department of Commerce's United States Census Bureau (vii) The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (viii) The U.S. Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (ix) The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (x) The libraries of local schools, universities, municipalities, historical societies, and State agencies (xi) Local weather stations (xii) Knowledgeable people such as faculty members of universities; representatives of NRCS, the soil conservation district, the cooperative extension service, and the Farm Services Agency; vocational agriculture teachers; local representatives of planning boards, sanitation departments, and State and county highway departments; agricultural product dealers; the State organization of professional soil scientists; and State and local geologists (xiii) Local and State data clearinghouses (xiv) State university and college data sets</p>
<p>E. Assembly of Equipment</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The kinds and use of equipment are discussed in chapter 4 of the Soil Survey Manual.</p></li>
<li><p>A digital camera is necessary in all soil survey areas. The camera should be available to take photos when opportunities arise. Labeling and filing photographs in a systematic manner allows easy retrieval.</p></li>
<li><p>Office computers, scanners, plotters, field data collection and recording devices, and similar equipment improve and enhance data analysis, revision, and summary.</p></li>
<li><p>At minimum, an office laboratory space and equipment is necessary to conduct basic soil analyses for such properties as reaction (pH), conductivity (EC), analysis of particle-size distribution, carbonate equivalence, and similar tests. Ovens, scales, and measuring and mixing equipment, as well as chemicals necessary to support such analyses, are required.</p></li>

</h3>
<p>A. Geodatabase Development</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Set up geodatabases with topology and import data layers. - Use the standards for file naming - Create a geodatabase - Import data into the geodatabase - Project data to the desired geographic location - Create a feature dataset - Import template feature classes - Set up domains</p></li>
<li><p>Set up the map environment for creating digital soils data. - Create a map and add data layers - Customize a map, using- â€“ Toolbars and menus â€“ Symbology â€“ Image display - Create a layer overview - Add or delete fields and calculate values - Set selectable layers</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize various software in combination with appropriate data sets to accurately draft and revise soil mapping on screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Import, create, and display georeferenced information to validate soil map accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Create metadata to capture data sources and processes used in the development of digital mapping.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>B. File Naming System The geodatabase is named as follows: State abbreviation followed by county or parish FIPS code, "OFFICIAL," and the current date (two-digit month, day, and year) (e.g., PG695_OFFICIAL_072105).</p>
<p>C. Archiving In order to protect electronic data from accidental loss or software or hardware failure, certain archiving procedures are implemented.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The MLRA soil survey leader or project leader establishes an office archive procedure and communicates it to all soil scientists working on the project.</p></li>
<li><p>The project leader adds metadata notes into the geodatabase, compacts the geodatabase, and makes a copy of it using the copy and paste function in ArcCatalog. The copy is then renamed by changing "OFFICIAL" to "GIS" and using the current date (e.g., PG695_GIS_072205).</p></li>
<li><p>The project leader confirms that metadata notes are kept to record scale of digitizing and imagery used. Brief metadata entries are made in the "Abstract" section of the metadata in ArcCatalog for each geodatabase version that is sent for archiving. Notes in the "Abstract" and "Purpose" sections may also be made for feature classes.</p></li>
<li><p>The following schedule should be followed to safeguard the geodatabase: - Daily.-All new or edited soil mapping data is backed up to hard drive storage at the soil survey office. A separate copy of the geodatabase is therefore saved on a hard drive separate from that of the active file being edited. â€“ Edits are frequently saved during an edit session in case the software crashes. Saving edits is different from saving the geodatabase. â€“ Topology is frequently validated, and errors are fixed while editing. â€“ The geodatabases are compacted in ArcCatalog. - Weekly.-All new or edited soil mapping data is copied onto a CD or DVD and stored offsite for security. Updates can be added to previous media in order to maintain an archive of edited versions. - Monthly.-When soil mapping data are being updated, a copy of the geodatabase is sent by compressing it into a WinZip file and attaching this file to an email (or on a CD or DVD) to designated GIS staff. If no edits have been made, this is not necessary. - Annually.-After completing a 100-percent quality control review of the digital data, the project leader sends a copy of the overall geodatabase to the soil survey regional office for quality assurance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Quality Assurance</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The MLRA soil survey leader completes a 100-percent quality control review of digital data, validates topology for the entire feature class, and fixes identified errors. After the quality control review is completed, a copy of the geodatabase is renamed (e.g., PG675_QA_current date) and then sent to the soil survey regional office for quality assurance.</p></li>
<li><p>A soil data quality specialist compares digital data with the field sheets during annual reviews or field assistance visits and discusses differences. For soil survey offices that use only digital mapping data, the review evaluates landscape registration and map unit concepts. An additional brief review is completed at the end of the survey.</p></li>
<li><p>The soil survey regional office reviews monthly copies for quality of boundary line work and geodatabase properties.</p></li>
<li><p>Offices that have soil mapping on paper field sheets perform a 100-percent review of progressive digitizing when the soil survey is completed or when interim data are finalized.</p></li>

<h3 id="soil-survey-area-designation">608.2 Soil Survey Area Designation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#soil-survey-area-designation"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition A soil survey area is a geographic area that has a size and shape defined for efficient field operations and timely release of products. A soil survey area is an administrative unit for project management (staffing and equipment), progress reporting, and delivery of products. Soil survey area coverage includes all lands of the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin Territories.</p>
<p>B. Purpose</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>National Soil Survey Center personnel follow the guidance set out in this section to identify soil survey areas in the NASIS database. Each soil survey area receives a unique area name and alphanumeric area symbol that are used in NASIS, the Soil Data Warehouse and Soil Data Access sites, cooperative agreements, memoranda of understanding, all survey area publications, correlation documents, and other official reports and correspondence. There are two types of soil survey areas recognized for managing soil surveys: (i) MLRA soil survey area (MLRA SSA) (ii) Non-MLRA soil survey area (non-MLRA SSA)</p></li>
<li><p>Refer to part 608, subpart B, section 608.12, for guidance on project administration and acreage management in the NASIS database.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>C. MLRA Soil Survey Area (MLRA SSA)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In 2008, the NCSS Program was reorganized with soil survey areas based on MLRAs formally recognized across the Nation rather than on political boundaries, such as counties, and Federal land ownership. The MLRA soil survey areas follow physiographic boundaries reflecting natural features such as similar soils, geology, land use, and climate. They are the basis for the development of the soil survey legend used for interpretive needs and for all related classification, correlation, quality control, and quality assurance functions. The goal is to provide a seamless soil survey.</p></li>
<li><p>The boundaries of the MLRA SSA may encompass all or parts of one or more MLRAs. Changes in boundaries of the MLRA SSAs and office locations are approved by the director of the Soil Science Division.</p></li>
<li><p>MLRA SSAs are identified with an area symbol consisting of the SSR area number to which they are assigned, followed by the first three letters of the city in which the office is located. Examples are Asheville, North Carolina (6-ASH) and Elko, Nevada (2-ELK).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area (Non-MLRA SSA)</p>

<li><p>These areas are the county-based areas (or other similar areas based on political boundaries, such as a parish, national forest, or military base, or parts of a county subdivided or combined into more convenient-sized project areas) that have been traditionally used in the Soil Survey Program. They are used for exporting datasets from NASIS to the Soil Data Warehouse for product delivery to the Web Soil Survey. They are also used for completion of the initial soil survey. These areas are subsets of MLRA SSAs.</p></li>
<li><p>Boundary Designation (i) Cooperating agencies of the NCSS designate the boundaries of non-MLRA soil survey areas in consultation with major users of soil information. (ii) The boundaries may correspond to county boundaries, physiographic boundaries, Tribal boundaries, Federal agency management boundaries, or other land management areas. - Two or more small counties may be combined to form the survey area. - Large counties and physiographic areas may be subdivided for efficiency of field operations and publication of a final product. (iii) The boundaries used for non-MLRA soil survey areas may be changed by the SSR director in consultation with NCSS cooperators, State soil scientists, and the National Soil Survey Center, as needed. Refer to section 608.2D. (iv) Considerations for defining boundaries include- - Efficiency of managing legends and databases for different and overlapping spatial areas in the information system. - Timely and efficient delivery of the products. - Other factors important to cooperators.</p></li>
<li><p>Naming and Symbolization (i) The RSS director coordinates with the NSSC and affected State soil scientists in creating area names and symbols for soil surveys designated non-MLRA soil survey areas for registration in NASIS. The area names should not exceed 135 characters. (ii) For non-MLRA soil survey areas that correspond to a single county, parish, or independent city boundary, the symbol consists of the State abbreviation followed by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for the county, parish, or independent city. The FIPS codes are in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication Series of the National Bureau of Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce. (iii) For all other non-MLRA soil survey areas, the symbol consists of the State abbreviation and a unique 600-, 700-, or 800-series number that is assigned in lieu of the FIPS code. (iv) Below are examples of names and symbols for non-MLRA soil survey areas that have differing boundary designations: - Soil Survey Area That Corresponds to a Single County Boundary - Baldwin County, Alabama (AL003) - Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana (LA109) - Soil Survey Area That Corresponds to Two or More County Boundaries - Beaver and Lawrence Counties, Pennsylvania (PA603) - James City and York Counties and the City of Williamsburg, Virginia (VA695) - Soil Survey Area That Includes Only Part of a Single County Select a name that clearly distinguishes the survey area from other survey areas in the county or from adjoining counties. If a clear designation cannot be made, use the words "part" or "area" to indicate that the survey area boundary does not include the entire county. â€“ Washoe County, Nevada, South Part (NV628) â€“ Socorro County Area, New Mexico (NM664) - Soil Survey Area That Includes Parts of Two or More Counties in One State Use the name of a well-known place or geographic feature and list the counties. â€“ Jicarilla Apache Area, New Mexico, Parts of Rio Arriba and Sandoval Counties (NM698) â€“ Wenatchee National Forest, Naches Area, Washington, Parts of Kittitas and Yakima Counties (WA680) - Soil Survey Area That Includes All of One or More Counties and Part of Another - Soil Survey of Curry County and Southwest Part of Quay County, New Mexico (NM669) - Menifee and Rowan Counties and Northwestern Morgan County, Kentucky (KY632) - Soil Survey Area That Includes Parts of Two or More Counties in Adjoining States - Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina (TN640) - Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina (NC640) - Shiprock Area, Parts of San Juan County, New Mexico, and Apache County, Arizona (NM717) - Shiprock Area, Parts of San Juan County, New Mexico, and Apache County, Arizona (AZ717) Note: In order to maintain acreage integrity for all States, separate project entries are made in NASIS for survey areas that cross State boundaries. - Soil Survey Area That is in a Region With No Counties Use the name of a well-known place or geographic feature in the area. â€“ San German Area, Southwestern Puerto Rico (PR787) â€“ North Star Area, Alaska (AK642)</p></li>

<p>E. Small Geographic Areas</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Special management areas, such as small political subdivisions, areas of Tribal lands, and Federal management areas (e.g., National Park Service units, national forests, and Bureau of Land Management lands), are ordinarily handled as special projects or subsets (overlaps) of a larger soil survey area.</p></li>
<li><p>Soil survey regional directors in consultation with State soil scientists designate small geographic areas as soil survey areas. Legends for these areas are linked to the appropriate area types in NASIS, as needed.</p></li>

<h3 id="areas-of-limited-access-denied-access-areas-and-areas-not-completed">608.3 Areas of Limited Access, Denied Access Areas, and Areas Not Completed<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#areas-of-limited-access-denied-access-areas-and-areas-not-completed"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition Many survey areas include parts that have difficult or limited access for personnel conducting field operations, and occasionally landowners deny access to their property. The goal of the NCSS is to survey all lands, and soil survey area coverage includes all lands (refer to section 608.2). Some survey areas that are only partially mapped may be posted to the Web Soil Survey.</p>
<p>B. Purpose Land should not be excluded from a soil survey area based on difficult or limited access or because of difficulty in obtaining permission to gain access. All available resources should be used, such as old soil survey maps (if available), geology and topographic maps, aerial photography, and other available remote-sensing materials, to apply common field procedures and techniques in delineating map units. For relatively small areas, mapping surrounding lands and projecting soil lines across the area of denied access may be feasible. For relatively large areas, more broadly defined map units may be appropriate. In these cases, the reduced reliability in the map unit description should be described.</p>
<p>C. Surveying in Denied Access Areas</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Soil survey regional directors, in consultation with the State Conservationist, State soil scientist, and local cooperators, determine the feasibility of mapping areas of denied access. Reliability of the mapping for anticipated use and interpretations should be the final determining factor.</p></li>
<li><p>Use judgment in deciding whether to attempt to gain permission to map areas of denied access. In some cases, such as when areas are restricted for national security purposes or where Native American officials desire that Tribal lands remain unmapped, the decision may be made to not pursue the issue further.</p></li>
<li><p>In situations other than those described in paragraph (1) above, use all reasonable means to obtain permission to map. Enlist the aid of community leaders, district cooperators and supervisors, county and State officials, and others, as appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>If reasonable efforts to gain access are unsuccessful, apply techniques and resources discussed in section 608.3B to map the area.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Reporting Denied Access Areas (ANS)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Delineate the area with the map unit symbol "ANS" for a map unit with the name "Area not surveyed, access denied." This is a national map unit that is queried in NASIS and added to the survey area through a linkage in the NASIS "Legend Mapunit" table. The map unit status is identified as "correlated" because an attempt was made to map the area but access was denied.</p></li>
<li><p>In the map unit description, simply state "Area not surveyed, access denied." Include the symbol and the acreage in the soil survey acreage table of the final report. Acreage for small or isolated areas of ANS is reported as mapping progress using standard progress reporting procedures. In rare cases where the area of denied access is very large, acreage of the unmapped area (ANS) is not reported as mapping progress.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>E. Identifying Areas Not Completed (NOTCOM)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The purpose of identifying NOTCOM areas is to provide a consistently displayed map unit symbol for progressively correlated information published to the Web Soil Survey that identifies those areas yet to be completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The map unit designation "NOTCOM" is used to identify spatial areas that have not been surveyed. This designation does not include areas of limited access or denied access areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Delineate the area with the national map unit symbol "NOTCOM" and the map unit name "No digital data available." This is a national map unit that is queried in NASIS and added to the survey area through a linkage in the NASIS "Legend Mapunit" table. The map unit status is identified as "approved" though the area has been neither mapped nor correlated.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>F. General Soil Maps The STATSGO2 map is the basis for the survey area general soil maps. Do not exclude any areas, even those areas excluded from detailed mapping, from the general soil map for the survey area and the U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2) database. Use standard procedures for delineating general soil map units and STATSGO2 map units.</p>

<h3 id="determining-workloads">608.4 Determining Workloads<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#determining-workloads"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition Title 340, General Manual, describes agency policy for strategic workload planning and continuous process improvement. Other cooperating agencies have their own policy for workload planning.</p>
<p>B. Purpose The workload planning process considers the work to be done, which is identified as projects. Estimates are made of the amount of time required to complete each project, and a timetable is made for completing the work. The workload process will vary slightly depending on the type of survey operation, either initial or update.</p>
<p>C. Initial Soil Survey</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A long-range plan for initial soil survey projects details the activities needed to complete the project in a realistic amount of time (i.e., about 5 years or less). See part 608, subpart B, section 608.10.</p></li>
<li><p>An annual plan of operations for initial soil survey projects is used to guide and provide specific focus to staff as the long-range plan is being implemented. See part 608, subpart B, section 608.11.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Update Soil Survey</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The SSO long-range plan considers all aspects of bringing all soil surveys in the area to a common standard to meet user needs. An inventory and assessment of the MLRA soil survey area is completed prior to development of a long-range plan (see part 610, subpart B, sections 610.10 to 610.12). In addition to the needs of the private lands in the area, it should include the needs identified by the cooperators responsible for the Federal lands within the area so that a coordinated effort is achieved in all soil survey work. The format and level of detail for the long-range plan may vary. The purpose is not to develop detailed plans to accomplish all of the needs but rather to identify the needs in enough detail to allow them to be prioritized effectively. Detailed planning to accomplish the highest priority needs then takes place through project plans.</p></li>
<li><p>Project plans for the SSO (see part 610, subpart A, section 610.4, of this handbook) are developed for one or more of the highest priority needs. The actual length of time needed to complete the project depends on the scope of the project and how it is defined. When possible, projects of very large extent should be redesigned as several smaller projects of shorter duration. Shorter-term projects are preferred because they can be managed and delivered more effectively. Some projects might be completed in weeks or months while others might require up to 2 years. Project plans are broken down into reportable milestones to identify annual progress. See part 610, subpart B, section 610.16, for an example.</p></li>
<li><p>An SSO annual plan of operations (or business plan) is used to identify objectives, goals, responsibilities, and timelines during a fiscal year.</p></li>

<h3 id="priorities-for-soil-survey-activities">608.5 Priorities for Soil Survey Activities<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#priorities-for-soil-survey-activities"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition State cooperative soil survey conferences, led by the State soil scientist, convene annually to discuss soil survey activities, consider cooperator priorities, and recommend action. Other interested user groups recommend priorities for such things as special or interim soil reports. Considerations for preparing the priority list are- (i) The status of initial soil surveys. (ii) NRCS needs for carrying out Farm Bill and technical or financial assistance programs and projects. (iii) Cooperating agency needs for meeting their program and project needs. (iv) Requests for soil surveys by local people. (v) Needs of Federal partners on Federal lands. (vi) Needs of State, Tribal, county, city or other local units of government for information that aids in land use planning and decisions. (vii) Rapid land use changes in areas where critical soil problems are expected. (viii) Contributions of funds or staffing. (ix) Needs for assessing land productivity value. (x) Other factors of specific local importance.</p>
<p>B. Purpose</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The management team, in cooperation with the MLRA SSO leader, works with the above information to identify the needs for each SSO. Long-range plans are then refined to address the needs of the MLRA soil survey area (see part 610, subpart A, section 610.2, of this handbook). Where Federal lands are included within the MLRA soil survey area, it is important to coordinate with the appropriate representatives of those agencies.</p></li>
<li><p>The MLRA SSO leader, with input from the technical team, consolidates each State's needs for the SSO long-range plan.</p></li>
<li><p>The long-range plan is used by the management team and technical team to develop priorities. Priorities are then reviewed by the soil survey regional director for approval. The MLRA SSO leader incorporates the priorities into one or more individual MLRA project plans.</p></li>
<li><p>The SSO long-range plan is maintained as work progresses and new information or unforeseen circumstances arise. Additional issues to be addressed may come from a variety of sources, such as resource soil scientists, field offices, cooperators, customers, the SSR, and State soil scientists. Reports from Web Soil Survey or NASIS may also reveal issues and deficiencies that need to be prioritized and addressed in the future.</p></li>

<h3 id="planning-workflow">608.6 Planning Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#planning-workflow"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. MLRA project plans direct the use of resources to accomplish identified activities as described above. An SSO will typically have multiple plans in progress each year. The plans are managed in NASIS and identify the activities that need to be accomplished by the plan. Each plan includes the name of the person or staff responsible for each activity, projected completion dates, and goals.</p>
<p>B. Part 608, subpart B, sections 608.10 and 608.11, provide sample formats for a long-range plan and annual plan of operations for initial soil surveys. In part 610, subpart B, sections 610.10 to 610.16, examples of documents used for planning MLRA update soil surveys are provided. These documents may be adapted to fit the needs identified for the soil survey area.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="goals-and-progress">608.7 Goals and Progress<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#goals-and-progress"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition The establishment of performance goals and progress reporting is required by policy and outlined in the general manual (340-GM, Part 400, "Strategic Planning and Accountability"). NASIS includes a number of tables and data elements for planning, managing, and tracking status, milestone events, and progress of activities of the NCSS and Technical Soil Services (defined in part 600 of the Technical Soil Services Handbook). These data are stored in the "Project" object and in the "Technical Soil Services" object in NASIS. Projects for initial soil survey work are linked to "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Areas." Projects for update work are defined by map units and are linked in NASIS through the data field "MLRA Soil Survey Office Area." No entries are populated for update project work in the data field "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area."</p>
<p>B. Purpose</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Managers use goals and progress information recorded in NASIS to assess workloads, develop activity schedules and budgets, and plan for resources needed to complete the national soil inventory and related databases. Included as projects in NASIS are all active initial mapping on non-MLRA soil survey areas, as defined in section 608.2, and all updating of survey information, as defined in part 610 of this handbook.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial projects that are linked in NASIS to each "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area" contain administrative and other data that track the key business processes of the initial survey from field data collection through final publication.</p></li>
<li><p>Update projects are linked to the "MLRA Soil Survey Office Area" and contain administrative and other data that track the key business process for updating map units from the field data collection through final publication. The map units in an update project are listed in the "Project Mapunit" table.</p></li>
<li><p>A "milestone" is an item or task identified to be completed during the initial or update project. Milestones are process steps, such as the number of transects collected, number of pedon descriptions gathered, amount of spatial line work edited, number of OSDs revised, etc. The milestone information is entered into the NASIS "Project Milestone" table. Milestones allow the manager to divide the project into reportable items and track the progress. Progress towards completion of each milestone is entered into the NASIS "Project Milestone Progress" table.</p></li>
<li><p>The scheduled activities and progress of technical soil services are reported in NASIS. See section 608.8B for more information on scheduling.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>C. Responsibilities</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data stewards for the various soil survey business areas are responsible for populating data elements and ensuring data quality in NASIS. Soil survey business areas perform all inventory-related activities at the field level and support and enable activities done in the generation of soil survey products.</p></li>
<li><p>The business area responsible for either initiating or completing a soil survey business process also is responsible for populating appropriate data elements and reporting progress associated with the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Part 608, subpart B, section 608.11, identifies broad soil survey business areas along with associated NASIS tables and data elements, and section 608.13 specifies the organizational office levels in NRCS that are responsible for populating the data. Some data elements in the exhibit indicate more than one responsible office level. For these situations, the appropriate business area program managers designate the responsible data steward. See section 608.1 for additional information.</p></li>
<li><p>Program managers may delegate the responsibility of populating some data elements to the SSO. For example, MLRA soil survey leaders may be designated to report mapping and compilation progress for their respective area.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Accessibility of the Data Soil survey area legends and projects are accessible through the NASIS interface. The interface enables authorized users with full capability to create, edit, and report data. Extreme care should be taken to avoid populating or changing data that falls under the responsibility of another business unit. Various reports are available in NASIS to summarize the data.</p>
<p>E. Data Management Part 608, subpart B, section 608.11, identifies soil survey business areas and related data elements, including key terminology and protocols, necessary for administration and maintenance of the data. Section 608.13 provides an overview of the data elements and responsible soil survey business areas.</p>
<p>F. Soil Survey and Ecological Site Performance Measurement</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The NRCS Performance Results System (PRS) is the official progress reporting instrument used by the agency to prepare national-level reports. Agency-accountable items, such as soil mapping on initial acres and progress on updating data, are assembled from NASIS nightly and automatically uploaded to PRS. Acres of ecological sites inventoried are entered directly into PRS by staff in the States.</p></li>
<li><p>NASIS data is used to assess program performance and analyze budgets. Examples include signed MOUs, progress reviews and correlations completed, manuscripts edited, acres compiled and digitized, and the status of imagery and orthophotography acquisition. Both individual and business area performance can be analyzed.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance Goals (i) At the beginning of the fiscal year, individual and team goals for soil survey business activities should be established. (ii) In addition to initial and update soil surveys, mapping goals may be set for nonproject survey areas based on anticipated requests for conservation planning. (iii) Supervisors- - Base performance goals on the individual's job description, experience, and training, on complexity, and on other factors. - Monitor progress throughout the year. - Revise individual or team performance goals, as needed, in consultation with the employee. (iv) On initial soil survey projects, the soil survey office leader sets goals based on acres mapped (including data population in NASIS and geospatial components). In addition, goals for other aspects of soil survey can be established, especially for local project management. (v) In update soil survey work, the soil survey office leader sets goals based on completing milestones tracked in NASIS. (vi) The goals for technical soil services are assigned to resource soil scientists by supervisors at the State office or area office level. (vii) Performance goals may be set for- - Technical soil services and soil survey support activities. - Mapping goals (although large water bodies, such as census water, should not be included, census water acres should be reported as a land category in the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table). - Gathering of field documentation. - Database development. - GIS analysis. - Correlations. - Manuscript development.</p></li>
<li><p>Progress and Progress Reporting (i) Soil survey progress records the inventory of the Nation's soil resources, development of related databases, soil survey products, and interpretative materials. (ii) Soil survey regional directors are responsible for ensuring that progress is reported. (iii) Reportable items are all activities, including intermediate products (e.g., milestones) that lead to a final product that meets NCSS standards. These items are: - Acres mapped - Correlations completed - Acres compiled and digitized - Ecological site description development and inventory - Documentation collected (e.g., pedon descriptions, transects, photographs, monitoring data, laboratory samples, vegetation data, and special studies) (iv) Progress should be reported in NASIS as it occurs. As a minimum, mapping progress should be reported quarterly and all other progress monthly.</p></li>
<li><p>Mapping Progress (i) Initial Projects - Refer to part 608, subpart B, section 608.11, for further discussion on reporting mapping progress. - The regional soil survey director should discuss progress reporting issues with the associate director for soil survey programs and associate director of soil operations at Soil Science Division headquarters before significantly revising performance goals. - For each non-MLRA soil survey area, create, if not already created, a project in NASIS and enter mapping progress into the "Project Mapping Progress" table by land category (refer to acreage accountability below). - Enter the reporting date in the "Project Mapping Progress" table. This date determines the fiscal year for which progress is counted. - Report progress as initial mapping. - Distinguish NRCS personnel from cooperator personnel. - Enter each individual's progress or the project team's progress as a whole. - Closely monitor initial soil surveys. Report initial mapping progress only one time and never delete it from the system once it is reported, except when data entry errors are immediately recognizable and easily corrected. - Upon completion of the initial soil survey, ensure that all initial acres reported as progress equal the land category acres and that the sum of all land category acres equals the area acres for the respective non-MLRA soil survey area. (ii) Update Projects (See part 610, subpart A, section 610.3, of this handbook) - Report milestones upon completion of the task. - Distinguish NRCS personnel from cooperator personnel. - Enter each individual's progress or the project team's progress as a whole. - Report project acres upon publication of the project map units to the Soil Data Warehouse.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>G. Project Administration and Acreage Management</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>NASIS provides a variety of ways in which data can be managed. Therefore, if the system is to function optimally, a uniform approach is required.</p></li>
<li><p>In NASIS, the data field "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area" provides data about goals and progress for mapping and other milestone activities for initial soil survey work. A project is created for each initial soil survey project. Projects for soil survey update activities should be developed as needed (see part 610, subpart A, section 610.4, of this handbook).</p></li>
<li><p>Unique Spatial Areas (i) All "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Areas" represent a unique geographical (spatial) area, such as an entire county, multiple counties, or parts of one or more counties. They receive a unique area symbol and area name (see section 608.2). (ii) In NASIS 6.0, a project was created for each legend linked to a "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area." The resulting project was named for the survey area and the status shown in the "Legend" table (e.g., Allen County, Kansas - Update needed). Data from the "Legend Data" object related to goals and progress in NASIS 5.4 were moved to this new project and related tables. Acreage data in the various tables for these specific, completed projects are not to be edited. (iii) Section 608.12 provides additional information and examples of various project scenarios and protocols.</p></li>
<li><p>Acreage Accountability NRCS, as Federal lead for the NCSS, maintains records of soil survey mapping for all lands of the Nation. - Seven land categories distinguish non-Federal ownership from Federal ownership. Additionally, Federal lands are categorized according to the responsible Federal land management agency. The seven land categories are: - Native American land - Other non-Federal land - Bureau of Land Management - U.S. Forest Service - National Park Service - Other Federal land - Census water - Refer to part 608, subpart B, section 608.12, for definitions of the land categories and for additional information on acreage management and accountability.</p></li>
<li><p>Acreage Allocation Federal and private land ownership and acreages constantly change. State soil scientists must periodically review land ownership for all soil survey areas. This information is maintained in the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table in NASIS. - If ownership acres have changed in a soil survey area, the State soil scientist reports changes and discrepancies to the soil survey regional director. The soil survey regional director- - Reallocates acreage assigned to the seven land categories. - Reallocates progress assigned to each land category. - The sum of all land category acres within a project for a "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area" must equal the area acreage for the survey area. - The sum of all land category acres within a project for a "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area" must equal the State total acreage from the 1992 National Resource Inventory. - To reallocate acres for soil surveys that have more than one project or that partially overlap another survey, refer to the discussion of acreage management and accountability in part 608, subpart B, section 608.12.</p></li>
<li><p>Acreage Base County-based 1992 National Resources Inventory (NRI) data for total surface area (land and water) is used within NRCS as the official acreage for non-MLRA soil survey areas that coincide with county or parish boundaries and for State totals. Acreages for non-MLRA soil survey areas that do not coincide with county or parish boundaries must be balanced with the respective State totals. - Use the exact county-based figures or round to the nearest hundred. - Coordinate acreage assigned to all survey areas with the national NASIS data steward at the National Soil Survey Center for inclusion in NASIS.</p></li>

</h3>
<p>This exhibit provides additional guidance for administering data in NASIS related to goals and progress reporting. It is primarily intended for Soil Survey Program managers and data stewards. It is divided into four major Soil Survey Program business areas for ease of reference. Data elements relevant to the business areas are listed and discussed. Also refer to section 608.13 for a quick- reference companion that provides a snapshot of business area responsibilities for NRCS offices. The four business areas are: (1) project administration and acreage management; (2) mapping goals and progress; (3) imagery, orthophotography, map compilation materials, and other data layers; and (4) initial and update survey operations. Definitions of data elements are in NASIS and therefore are not provided in this document. Additional explanations are provided for some data elements.</p>
<p>I. Project Administration and Acreage Management Timely administration of projects and acreage accountability are critical functions in assuring the usefulness of the NASIS database as a management tool. Projects serve as "place holders" to plan future needs, identify progress, and track milestone events leading to completion of soil survey products. Guiding Principles: 1. The tables and data elements related to goals and progress are imbedded in the NASIS database, which is a multiuser database. They serve as the official reporting instrument for production soil survey activities of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. 2. Administration is the responsibility of State offices; updating maps and data is the responsibility of data stewards of the soil survey business area. 3. For the initial soil survey, data are maintained in projects linked to the "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Areas" owned by the NASIS site "NSSC Pangaea." - Each "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area" is linked to a project in NASIS. All geographic areas of the Nation are covered in at least one such survey area. - With the data conversion to NASIS 6.0, a project was created for each legend linked to a non-MLRA soil survey area. The resulting project was named for the survey area and the status shown in the "Legend" table (e.g., Allen County, Kansas - Update needed). Data from the "Legend Data" object related to goals and progress in NASIS 5.4 were moved to this new project and related tables. Acreage data in the various tables for these specific, completed projects are not to be edited. - Mapping progress and milestones may be reported continuously but, as a minimum, are reported at the end of each quarter. Other data entries may be maintained continuously but, as a minimum, are current at the end of each month. 4. For update soil survey work, a project is created for each project plan developed for the "MLRA Soil Survey Office Area." - Projects are linked to the appropriate "MLRA Soil Survey Office Area" in NASIS. - Mapping progress and milestones may be reported continuously but, as a minimum, are reported at the end of each quarter. Other data entries may be maintained continuously but, as a minimum, are current at the end of each month.</p>

<p>B. Acreage Management Protocols for Initial Soil Survey Projects Linked to Non-MLRA Soil Survey Areas Seven land categories are used to identify the ownership of all lands of the United States and its trust territories. The land categories are: Native American land, other non-Federal land, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, other Federal land, and census water. Accordingly, acreage is assigned in each project linked in NASIS to a "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area," subject to the following conventions: 1. Land categories reflect the current land ownership in the survey area. 2. The sum of all land category acres from all projects linked to "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Areas" in a State equals the 1992 NRI acres for the State. 3. Land category acres are balanced across projects that cover the same geographic area so that each acre is recorded only once. 4. Survey areas that cover parts of two or more States will have a separate project for each State. Each project will have land categories, land category acres, goals, and progress for the respective State. A "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area" will be needed for each State involved. The area symbol will be assigned for the respective State. The area name will be the same for both. Area acres will be for the whole survey area and will be recorded as the same in each State. 5. Acres are recorded to the actual acre or rounded to 100 acres. 6. Areas in Alaska identified as Alaska Native Lands or in Hawaii as Hawaiian Homelands are included in the meaning of Native American land. 7. Census water applies to all contiguous water polygons that are 40 acres in size or larger. If a water polygon is less than 40 acres in size in the survey area but extends into an adjoining survey area such that the total extent in both survey areas is more than 40 acres, then the water qualifies as census water. Census water acreage is not to be part of mapping goals; it is administratively managed in NASIS as a land category in the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table to account for total survey acres and progress. Project Scenarios and Protocols: 1. Survey Areas With One Project. Only one project is linked to a "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area" in NASIS and no other survey areas have been established that coincide geographically with any part of the survey area. The actual (or best estimate of) land category acres are recorded in the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table. The sum of all acres recorded in the table are to equal the survey area acreage. 2. Survey Areas With Two or More Projects. These areas typically have an older out-of-date legend and corresponding project and a newer update or published legend and project. Acres in the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table should be rebalanced so that the older project shows zero acres in each land category. The newer project should reflect the actual (or best estimate of) land category acres in the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table. Thus, land category acres will be recorded only once for the survey area. Mapping progress should be retained in both the older and newer projects as appropriate (see the section on mapping goals and progress). 3. Survey Areas That Partly Coincide With Another Survey Area. These areas typically consist of a newer survey area that covers part of an older survey area or a newer survey that covers all or parts of two or more previous survey areas. Acres in the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table should be rebalanced in all affected survey area projects so that current land category acres are recorded in the newest project and subtracted from older projects. The sum of land category acres in the newest project will equal the survey area acreage. The resulting sum of land category acres in each of the other affected projects will total less than their respective survey area acreage. Mapping progress should be retained in both older and newer projects as appropriate (see the section on mapping goals and progress).</p>
<p>C. Acreage Management Protocols for Update Soil Survey Projects Linked to MLRA Soil Survey Areas Seven land categories are used to identify the ownership of all lands of the United States and its trust territories. The land categories are: Native American land, other non-Federal land, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, other Federal land, and census water. Accordingly, acreage is assigned in each project linked to a "Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area," subject to the following conventions: 1. Land categories reflect the current land ownership in the survey area. 2. For each such project developed, the appropriate land categories and acres will be entered into the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table. 3. As these projects stand on their own and the same acre of land may be covered by more than one project, there is no need to balance land category acres across projects or within a State. The same acre may be reported as being updated more than once. 4. Acres are recorded to the actual acre or rounded to 100 acres. 5. Areas in Alaska identified as Alaska Native Lands or in Hawaii as Hawaiian Homelands are included in the meaning of Native American land. 6. Census water applies to all contiguous water polygons that are 40 acres in size or larger. If a water polygon is less than 40 acres in size in the survey area but extends into an adjoining survey area such that the total extent in both survey areas is more than 40 acres, then the water qualifies as census water. Census water acreage is not to be part of mapping goals; it is administratively managed in NASIS as a land category in the "Project Land Category Breakdown" table so that total survey acres and progress are accounted for. II. Mapping Goals and Progress Goals and progress are recorded in the "Project Mapping Goal" and "Project Mapping Progress" tables for each defined project. Goals and progress may be recorded for each individual project staff member or for the project staff as a whole. Use the following protocols: 1. Project Staff. First, enter individual project member names in the "Project Staff" table before entering goals or progress. A choice list is provided based on user names in the NASIS "User" table. If a name needs to be added to the list, contact the Soils Hotline (<a href="mailto:SoilsHotline@lin.usda.gov" class="email">SoilsHotline@lin.usda.gov</a>) to request a NASIS user account. For more information on requesting NASIS user accounts, see part 639, subpart A, section 639.2, of this handbook. 2. Goals. Enter fiscal year goals in the "Project Mapping Goal" table at the beginning of each fiscal year. 3. Progress: a.) Enter mapping progress and show the effective progress reporting date in the "Project Mapping Progress" table under the appropriate land category. Note: The reporting date determines the fiscal year for progress reporting. Show initial and update mapping under NRCS or cooperator columns, as appropriate. Update acres may be reported in any project where update activity has occurred. b.) Once initial soil survey mapping progress has been reported in a project, that progress should not be moved to another project, unless an error was made in data entry. In order to show the current progress for all land categories, however, progress may need to be reallocated among land categories within the same project to reflect any changes in land ownership. Note: For situations where land category acres have been rebalanced across projects, acres of mapping progress reported for a land category may be more than the land category acres shown for that project and, in some cases, the land category acres may even be zero.</p>

<p>B. Reporting Mapping Progress - Project Mapping Progress Table o Progress Reporting Date o Initial NRCS Acres o Initial Cooperator Acres o Update NRCS Acres o Update Cooperator Acres o Project Staff Member Initial Acres. This item refers to mapping a soil survey area and reporting progress for the first time. The cumulative initial acres reported for a completed survey area always equals 100 percent of the survey area acres. The item applies to all lands of the Nation and mapping by both NRCS and cooperator personnel and to mapping at any order of detail or scale. Typically, initial acres are reported only for surveys having a nonproject or initial status but may apply to surveys with update status where areas that were not mapped during the initial survey are mapped and reported for the first time. Initial acres are reported only once for a given geographic area. All subsequent mapping on the same ground is reported as update acres. Update Acres. This item refers to updating and reporting progress on acres previously reported for the Nation. All update acreage reported must be a part of a project plan entered in NASIS that was approved by the MLRA management team for the soil survey region. Acres are reported when revised data is posted to the Soil Data Warehouse. Update projects consist of work that leads to significant changes in data or to work that confirms the quality of the existing attribute data. This work typically, but not always, results in the recorrelation of map units and their components. Update acres are reported even if the data and correlation are not changed. Update projects are based on an inventory and assessment of existing soil survey information and the deficiencies identified for correction. Refer to part 610 of this handbook for guidance on conducting the inventory and assessment. An update project is established after consideration of the work needed based on a project evaluation (described in part 610, subpart A, section 610.4). The project is designed to address, either all or a reasonable subset of, related needs that are identified for the area. One hundred percent of a map unit's acres are reported if update work was conducted on all components. Update acres are not reported for map units for which the edited component is used as a minor component. This situation pertains to map units that were not part of field investigation but for which revisions were extrapolated to the attribute data for the minor component. Updates are based on field observations, which are either new observations or existing documentation. All documentation used as the basis for updating official soil survey information is populated in NASIS, either as recorded point data or as text notes indicating where the data is located. The documentation is used as the basis for a change or to confirm the accuracy of the official data. III. Imagery, Orthophotography, Map Compilation Materials, and Other Data Layers These data elements are primarily the responsibility of State offices in their administrative and liaison capacity between soil survey regional offices and National Cooperative Soil Survey partners within a State. Field imagery, orthophotography, and map compilation materials may be needed for project survey operations or SSURGO initiatives. Beginning with NASIS 6.0, these needs are recorded in the "Project Data Need" table. Each type of product or data needed should be recorded on a separate row in the "Project Data Type" column using the choice list provided. Applicable dates need to be recorded in the "Date" columns. - Project Data Need Table o Project Data Type o Date Needed o Date Ordered o Date Received IV. Initial and Update Survey Operations These data elements relate most directly to production soil survey operations and therefore are the responsibility of the soil survey regional offices. Data elements relative to the memorandum of understanding for project areas and product types are jointly shared by State offices and soil survey regional offices.</p>

Administrative and Field Activities - Legend Table o MOU Signed o MOU Projected Completion o Project Scale.-Standard National map scales are 1:12,000 in quarter quad format or 1:24,000 in full quad format. Puerto Rico is approved for 1: 20,000 and Alaska is approved for 1: 25,000. Any other scale or format must be approved by the director of the Soil Science Division prior to development of the long-range plan for the survey area. - Project Field Review Table o Correlation Event = "Initial Field Review" o Correlation Event = "Final Field Review" o Date = date of the respective correlation event report - Project Table o English Edit Site o Digital Map Finishing Site</p>

<p>C. SSURGO Digitizing, Certification, and Archiving SSURGO Operations. As part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, a SSURGO database is developed for all areas. The Soil Science Division coordinates with NGCE in SSURGO database development. Soil survey regional offices have soil business responsibilities for the correlation and quality assurance of SSURGO products. The dataset is archived in the Soil Data Warehouse and delivered via the Web Soil Survey and Geospatial Data Gateway. SSURGO Progress Reporting. Progress and status for SSURGO development are tracked continuously in NASIS. Business areas with responsibilities for SSURGO development also have responsibility for populating the appropriate data elements in NASIS (refer to Section 608.13, "Business Area Responsibilities for Goals and Progress"). Data stewards are designated to ensure timely and accurate progress reporting. SSURGO Certification. These data elements are the primary responsibility of the soil survey regional office. If actual digitizing is not done by the soil survey regional office, States have responsibility for populating "digitizing started," "digitizing percent," and "digitizing completed" prior to sending the job to the digitizing unit for certification review. Dates and progress for the following milestones are recorded in the "Project Milestone" and "Project Milestone Progress" tables as outlined in section 608.13. - "Project Milestone" Table o Milestone Type Name = "Digitize maps" o Milestone Date Started = date the digitizing was started (The final correlation document, compilation certification, and attribute data are on file at the digitizing unit before the work is started. Correspondence that grants an exception is on file at the soil survey regional office.) o Milestone Date Completed = date the digitizing was completed (Quality control work by the State or the digitizing unit and quality assurance by the soil survey regional office are typically done after the digitizing is complete and before the SSURGO review is started.) - "Project Milestone Progress" Table o Milestone Progress Amount o Milestone Progress Unit = "percent" - "Project Milestone" Table o Milestone Type Name = "SSURGO Digital review" o Milestone Date Started = date the digital review was started o Milestone Type Name = "SSURGO Certification" o Milestone Date Completed = date the SSURGO dataset was certified o Milestone Type Name = "SSURGO Archived" o Milestone Date Completed = date the SSURGO dataset was archived</p>

</h3>
<p>A. Soil Survey Quality Control</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Soil survey quality control is the collective set of activities described in National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) standards and procedures whose purpose is to achieve a high level of quality. Controlling quality involves providing direct review and inspection, direction, and coordination of soil survey production activities to ensure that soil survey products meet the defined standards for content, accuracy, and precision. The quality of soil survey products is controlled at the level where each of the soil survey process steps (from field-level work through publication) takes place.</p></li>
<li><p>Decisions made at the field level have a broad effect, and errors are not easily detected or corrected. Responsibility for quality control of soil survey products, such as maps, descriptions, point and component data, texts, photographs, etc., rests with the major land resource area (MLRA) soil survey leader.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>B. Soil Survey Quality Assurance Soil survey quality assurance is the process of providing technical standards and guidelines, oversight and review, and training to ensure that soil survey products meet NCSS standards. Responsibility for ensuring the quality of soil survey products such as maps, descriptions, data, texts, photographs, etc., rests with the soil survey regional office (SSR).</p>
<p>C. Purpose Quality control and quality assurance are important at all levels in the preparation, publication, and update of a soil survey. Their purpose is to ensure that soil survey products are accurate and consistent, meet the objectives outlined in the memorandum of understanding or project plan, and satisfy the needs of the majority of soil survey users. Quality control and quality assurance activities also are carried out at other locations where soil survey products are developed, such as the National Soil Survey Center's Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) and the National Geospatial Center of Excellence (NGCE).</p>

<h3 id="soil-correlation">609.2 Soil Correlation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#soil-correlation"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. NRCS has leadership for soil correlation within the NCSS. Each SSR ensures the quality of soil surveys through a formal process of soil correlation within their assigned area. For soil surveys on Federal lands, NRCS works closely with partner agencies in carrying out these responsibilities. Soil correlation-</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Addresses the natural geographic distribution and extent of specific soils to ensure consistent and accurate mapping, naming, classification, joining, database population, and interpretation within the MLRA.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensures that data entered into the NASIS database meets NCSS standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensures that all adjacent soil survey maps sharing the same purpose, scale, and order of survey exactly join.</p></li>
<li><p>Documents that soil properties and qualities of map unit component are populated using standards provided in part 618 of this handbook.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensures that each map unit is distinguished from all others and that proper interpretations are assigned to each map unit component.</p></li>
<li><p>Facilitates the effective transfer of technology.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>B. Progressive Soil Correlation Progressive soil correlation is a process that identifies and records all the issues and decisions surrounding information at the soil map unit level throughout the course of a soil survey. It is used in initial soil surveys as well as in MLRA soil surveys. It is practiced throughout the course of a soil survey, keeping pace with progress. Field reviews and field assistance visits are vehicles through which the SSO and the SSR promote progressive correlation, maintain quality control and quality assurance, and ensure that technical standards are met. Progressive correlation requires that during each review or field assistance visit, any changes, deletions, or additions to taxonomic units and map units recognized since the last review or assist are evaluated and, if appropriate, certified. For soils that extend beyond the project area, data and descriptions representing the soil on similar landforms and parent materials are used. Documentation, such as ranges for soil properties and map unit composition, is evaluated and used for the survey in progress. All soil survey activities, including interpretation, legend development, joining, soil investigation, and report development, are concurrent with mapping.</p>
<p>C. Recording Progressive Soil Correlation Decisions All progressive soil correlation decisions and their reasoning are recorded in NASIS. Any change or addition to legends, taxonomic units, or map units must be recorded. In addition, significant changes to soil property data and interpretive data, such as ecological site designation, farmland classification, land capability classification, or crop yields, should be recorded. The reasons for the decision should be recorded if they are relevant and important to future users of the information.</p>
<p>D. Final Correlation</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Final correlation is a process that is used when an initial soil survey is near completion. If, during the course of an initial soil survey, effective progressive soil correlation has taken place, the final correlation is primarily a review of the progressive soil correlation decisions that have been previously made. The final correlation serves as a data check and also identifies any incomplete work that needs to be completed prior to the soil survey being certified.</p></li>
<li><p>After the final field review, the SSO and SSR schedule a time for a final correlation conference, the outcome of which is the draft correlation document. Although the final correlation is a joint effort between the SSO and SSR, it is the responsibility of the SSO to ensure that all data to be reviewed has passed prior quality control inspections. The SSO also is responsible for gathering and preparing all materials needed for the final correlation.</p></li>
<li><p>At the final correlation, the SSO and SSR- (i) Review and confirm the classification of each pedon that has been analyzed in a soil survey laboratory or engineering laboratory and revise the classification as needed (also, if needed, update appropriate site and classification elements of soil laboratory data for all pedons sampled in the survey area). (ii) Review taxadjuncts and taxons needing a correlation note and record the reason for the taxadjunct or correlation note in NASIS (e.g., unique or unusual information about a taxon that may prove useful to future users of the information). (iii) Review and confirm taxonomic units and their classification and summarize and process final edits and changes to taxonomic unit descriptions. (iv) Review and confirm the validity and classification of series and summarize and process final edits and changes to OSDs. (v) Review and confirm map unit names and ensure their conformity with current naming conventions and consistency in the survey area, and summarize and process final edits and changes to map unit descriptions. (vi) Review NASIS database entries for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. (vii) Review interpretations for accuracy and consistency. (viii) Review the draft report and identify any needed edits or changes. (ix) Review and examine maps for joins, proper labeling, and line conformity with the landform imagery. (x) Prepare a join statement that documents failures to join mapping units and polygons across survey boundaries, and identify how, where, and when field maps will be compiled, digitized, and map finished. (xi) Prepare and review other supporting documents or information to be included in the correlation document (such as soil-vegetation-climate schema or models, special investigative studies, and lists of references used throughout the course of the survey). (xii) Record where all field documentation, field maps, and other supporting materials and information will be archived. (xiii) Prepare a draft correlation document. (The soil survey regional director approves the final correlation.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>E. Correlation Document A correlation document, also referred to as a correlation memorandum, is a hardcopy product that is developed and distributed after the completion of an initial soil survey (see part 609, subpart B, section 609.10, for the format and content). The correlation document serves as a record of the final technical decisions made for a soil survey project. It provides- (i) The history and linkage from any previous survey information and to adjoining soil survey areas. (ii) List of all correlated map units, their components, and their taxonomic classifications. (iii) List of series that are established, dropped, or made inactive. (iv) Data on pedons sampled for laboratory analysis. (v) Specific instructions related to the publication of maps and the list of map and special symbols. (vi) If appropriate, the legend of the general soil map.</p>
<p>F. Development, Distribution, and Amendment Policy for the Correlation Document</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All changes to legends, map units, or taxons for a soil survey area, either initial or update, are documented and recorded in NASIS. Recording changes to legends, map units, or taxons in NASIS will ensure that portions of the correlation document can be generated directly from NASIS.</p></li>
<li><p>For initial soil surveys, a correlation document will be produced by the SSR and distributed per the following guidelines: (i) The soil survey regional director signs the final correlation document. The signature of the regional director certifies that the soil survey is complete and accurate. (ii) The regional director distributes copies of the signed classification and correlation document and of any subsequent amendments to the document, as follows: - One copy to each SSR that has responsibility for soil series used in the survey area - One copy to the State in which the survey area resides - One copy to each State that adjoins the survey area - One copy to Director, NGCE - One copy to Director, National Soil Survey Center - One copy to NCSS cooperating agencies, as appropriate - Copies to NRCS staff within the State (at the discretion of the State Conservationist) (iii) The final correlation document is archived in the "Project Correlation" table in NASIS. (iv) Prior to SSURGO certification, the archived final correlation document can be amended and hard copies redistributed for an initial soil survey area. Amendments to the final correlation document receive the same signatures and distribution as the original document. (v) Once a survey is SSURGO certified and deemed to be in update status, the correlation document and amendments are archived in NASIS. Subsequent correlation decisions are recorded in NASIS, and the original correlation document is no longer amended.</p></li>
<li><p>For update soil surveys- (i) All changes to legends, map units, or taxons must be documented and recorded in NASIS; however, the archived correlation document will not be amended and redistributed each time a change occurs as part of update activities. (ii) In lieu of amending and redistributing a hardcopy of the correlation document, a report will be generated from NASIS that lists and identifies all changes to legends, map units, and taxons. This report may be printed and distributed as the SSR deems necessary. (iii) A formal correlation document may be prepared and distributed for an MLRA soil survey area or a special project or to satisfy an agreement item with a cooperator.</p></li>

<h3 id="seamless-soil-survey">609.3 Seamless Soil Survey<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#seamless-soil-survey"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. The goal of soil survey is a seamless product across political and physiographic boundaries. A seamless product entails an exact join of attribute and spatial data between soil survey areas. In some situations, an exact join may not be possible but an acceptable join can be achieved.</p>
<p>B. Exact Joins An exact join between soil survey areas occurs when soil polygon lines and features are continuous across and along the common boundary and joined soil polygons share the same basic soil properties and selected soil qualities (see part 609, subpart B, section 609.11). Sharing basic properties and selected qualities includes major and minor component composition, basic property ranges (high, low, and representative values), and layer depths. An exact join should be achieved between two surveys with the same, or nearly the same, vintage, stated purpose, scale, and order of survey.</p>
<p>C. Acceptable Joins</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When employing the acceptable join, the SSR must affect the best join possible and document the need for future improvement to the join as appropriate. Acceptable joins are employed primarily when joining previously correlated surveys that would require field investigations to resolve the join discrepancies.</p></li>
<li><p>An acceptable join between soil survey areas occurs when soil polygon lines and features are continuous across and along the common boundary and soil properties and selected soil qualities share the same basic soil properties and selected soil qualities (see part 609, subpart B, section 609.11) for most polygons.</p></li>
<li><p>Where map unit components do not match, they fit the concept of similar soils.</p></li>
<li><p>Rationale for the nonjoined polygons (map units) must be documented.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Joining Requirements</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When completing a soil survey, map unit delineations along the boundary with each of the adjacent survey areas are to be joined. To achieve this goal, soil landscape features must be identified, mapped, and described consistently across political and physiographic boundaries. Data collection, analysis, and summary must represent these natural landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p>In most cases, an exact join should be achieved. An acceptable join may be the best join that can reasonably be achieved at the current time. If two soil surveys of different investigation intensities (orders) of mapping are adjacent, an exact join is in effect since the boundary between soil survey areas also serves as soil map unit boundaries. On hardcopy maps, a note is printed parallel to the boundaries that separate the areas of each survey order, such as "Limit of Order 3 Soil Survey." Chapter 4 of the Soil Survey Manual provides more information. Each soil line in the survey of lower intensity must have a corresponding soil line in the adjacent survey of higher intensity, but the converse is not required.</p></li>
<li><p>If an ongoing soil survey borders a survey area that is out-of-date and therefore acknowledged as being obsolete, the SSR should effect the best join possible using available knowledge and tools. It is not required to revise any part of the out-of-date survey until such time as an update project is initiated. The joining statement in the correlation document should state the situation.</p></li>
<li><p>The SSO prepares a statement regarding map unit joining with adjacent survey areas. The join statement document records all discrepancies from an exact join and any changes made to enact an exact or acceptable join between map unit polygons. Reasons for these changes should also be included in the join statement. This join statement documentation is included in the final correlation document and in NASIS.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes in map unit names or additions and deletions of map units or delineations to an existing soil survey as part of the SSURGO certification process are documented with an amendment to the final correlation document. Section 609.2E provides information on amending the final correlation document.</p></li>
<li><p>Minor adjustments to soil polygon lines are performed during SSURGO compilation and digitizing to facilitate a best possible join without benefit of field investigations. These adjustments generally involve moving lines slightly (so that they conform to new imagery and come together at the same point along the survey boundary) and coordinating the boundary between the two surveys. Changes in map unit names or additions and deletions of map units or delineations are documented with a correlation amendment. Digital soil surveys and discrepancy documentation and statements recorded in NASIS are tools for future update activities to implement MLRA legends and exact joins.</p></li>

<h3 id="quality-control-reviews">609.4 Quality Control Reviews<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quality-control-reviews"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Each individual involved in soil survey operations, regardless of their role, has a great influence on the quality of the overall soil survey product. All are expected to perform their duties so that the resulting soil survey products meet NCSS standards and are of high quality.</p>
<p>B. The MLRA soil survey leader is the first-level manager responsible for ensuring that all work performed within their assigned geographic area (including any satellite offices) is of high quality and meets NCSS standards. Much of this quality control responsibility is carried out on a day-to- day basis through direct interaction with subordinate staff members, such as scheduling activities and making work assignments, reviewing completed work, providing on-the-job training, and other related activities. In addition to these routine management activities, systematic reviews are periodically conducted to document the success of the quality control procedures used. The specific details of the items to be reviewed will vary with the kind of activities being carried out as described in the project plan of operations.</p>
<p>C. Part 609, subpart B, section 609.12, contains a template to use for a quality control review for an initial soil survey. The SSRs are encouraged to use this template or a similar form that reflects the activities to be reviewed in a particular SSO. Activities reviewed may include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Administrative activities and scheduling</p></li>
<li><p>Progress reporting</p></li>
<li><p>Review of mapping</p></li>
<li><p>Legend development and progressive correlation</p></li>
<li><p>Adequacy of field documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Field investigations and sampling</p></li>
<li><p>Database development</p></li>
<li><p>Digital map development</p></li>
<li><p>Publication development</p></li>
</ol>
<p>D. The template (section 609.12) provides separate sections for various soil survey process steps and a set of specific items to be reviewed and certified for each. Each SSR should work with the SSO in their region to implement a quality control review process appropriate to their needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="quality-assurance-reviews">609.5 Quality Assurance Reviews<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quality-assurance-reviews"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Quality assurance reviews are scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that technical standards of the NCSS are met. They also can evaluate and certify that progress is consistent with timelines agreed upon in the work plan. In addition, they can serve to help the SSO staff solve problems or provide on-the-job training for the project staff (however, these goals are best achieved through separate field assistance visits).</p>
<p>B. Title 340, General Manual, Part 404, Subpart E, "Internal Management Reviews," contains NRCS policy for and content of other reviews. Access is through the NRCS eDirectives System at <a href="http://policy.nrcs.usda.gov" class="external-link uri">http://policy.nrcs.usda.gov</a>. NRCS conducts five types of reviews: oversight and evaluation studies, leadership reviews, operations management reviews, program operations reviews, and functional reviews. Each type may include soil survey issues. Part 609, subpart B, section 609.13, lists potential items for these reviews.</p>
<p>C. Leadership and Participation The SSR or the lead agency for quality assurance conducts the review. The soil survey regional director leads the quality assurance review. Other suggested participants are- (i) Soil scientists from other nearby areas. (ii) Members of the SSO. (iii) The local district conservationists. (iv) The representatives of cooperating agencies. (v) The State soil scientist or their designee. (vi) Resource soil scientists familiar with the area. (vii) Discipline specialists such as engineers, geomorphologists, plant scientists, and geologists.</p>
<p>D. Kinds of Reviews for Initial Soil Surveys</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Each initial survey requires one initial and one final field review. Most initial surveys also require a yearly progress review. MLRA soil survey activities are reviewed for the status of progress toward meeting the goals and objectives set out in the project plan and annual plan of operation. The field review report is a record of such items as the current status of the fieldwork, observations and decisions, digital map and database development, and recommended actions. This working document guides future operations and certifies that completed work meets NCSS standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial Field Reviews (i) The purpose of the initial field review is to guide the soil survey project at the start of mapping, to review the collection and recording of soil data, and to complete preparation of the first formal draft of the descriptive legend, based on the mapping completed and data collected. Part 609, subpart B, section 609.14, lists important items to check before and during the initial field review. (ii) Preparation for an Initial Field Review.-An approved soil survey memorandum of understanding (MOU) must be available for the initial review. The MLRA regionwide MOU satisfies this requirement, but an MOU may also be developed for an individual project area. The long-range plan of operations must be available. The SSO assembles, reviews, and summarizes existing information about the MLRA and the subset survey area. The staff should be in place and have worked within the area long enough to become familiar with the project area and the surrounding surveys. The SSO staff prepares- - Preliminary concepts of the major soil-landscape models within the context of the larger MLRA region. - Test mapping of sample areas for the provisional legend. - Notes that support tentative judgments about the range of important soil properties within the most important kinds of mappable soil areas. - Information on the kind and amount of mapping components. - Information on geomorphology, surface features, and kinds of vegetation that provide clues to the kinds of soil and soil boundaries. - A test of the initial interpretations. - A first draft of the descriptive legend. - Preliminary data to support judgments about the kinds and number of map units needed for the project area. - Equipment, supplies, and base maps. (iii) Conduct of the Review - Initial Preparations.-The review team appraises all initial preparations to ensure that they are adequate and takes necessary action if they are not. - Field Study.-The review team evaluates the draft descriptive legend against mappable bodies of soil in the field and reviews the collected soil data. It checks the accuracy of descriptions and the adequacy of map units for making soil interpretations. It evaluates and comments on the mapping done in sample areas in relation to the adjacent surveys. The team checks the joining of soil maps and selected soil properties or qualities within the soil survey area to adjoining survey areas to ensure they meet the joining specification in the memorandum of understanding. It makes decisions on soils for which the classification is doubtful. - Descriptive Legend.-As a minimum, the descriptive legend consists of the taxonomic and map unit descriptions, the classification of the soils, the general soil map (U.S. General Soil Map - STATSGO2) and legend, the identification legend, and the features and symbol legend. After the field study, the review team evaluates the draft descriptive legend and makes necessary revisions. It examines the naming of the kinds of map units, the classification of the kinds of soil identified in the map units, the general soil map and legend, the list of features and symbols for the soil survey, and the definitions of ad hoc features. The team ensures that the design and description of map units meet the objectives of the survey. The descriptive legend includes only the map units and features that are actually identified and described before or during the initial field review. - Scheduling.-The review team discusses and schedules long- and short-range activities necessary for completing the survey. Part 609, subpart B, section 609.14, identifies many of the items to check before and during the initial field review. The team discusses activities and schedules for- - Preparation of parts of the soil handbook for the survey area. - Plans for soil investigations and collection of samples for laboratory analysis. - Collection of data on yields and soil performance in all land uses. - Recording of field notes. - Preparation of the soil survey publication. (iv) Preparation of the Report.-The leader of the initial field review prepares a report that is approved by the soil survey regional director. The report schedules subsequent progress field reviews and special studies. It includes arrangements for completing laboratory work and a quality assurance worksheet (see part 609, subpart B, section 609.15). It also includes- - The identification legend. - A progress map. - Draft descriptions of proposed new soil series. - A statement on the accuracy of map unit composition and attribute data. - Notes recording important observations made during the field study. - Instructions and items agreed upon for the field soil scientists and others, which concern conduct of the survey and the assignment of responsibilities, priorities, and dates of accomplishment. - A list of the classification of taxa in the survey area. - A subset of the U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2) database for the survey area as a general soil map. - A letter transmitting the report to the MLRA soil survey leader and others as appropriate, in which the soil survey regional director highlights significant issues and items that are agreed upon.</p></li>
<li><p>Progress Field Reviews (i) The purpose of this review is to assess progress and ensure that NCSS standards are being met. Progress field reviews emphasize progressive correlation in a manner consistent with the larger MLRA soil survey area and certification of the work completed to date. Help also may be provided to the soil survey staff on problems of soil classification; field mapping; data collection, storage, and retrieval; and soil interpretation. However, these problems are generally best addressed during a separate field assistance visit. (ii) The frequency of progress reviews depends on the rate of progress, the complexity of the soil survey area, and the experience of the SSO staff. Part 609, subpart B, section 609.16, lists some important items to check before and during progress field reviews. (iii) Conduct of the Review - The review team spends at least some of the time in the field observing examples of mapping, field descriptions, and associated data and interpretations to ensure that the local quality control procedures are effective. - The review team examines maps for correct soil identification, proper placement of boundaries, legibility, and kinds and amounts of components in delineations. - The team checks the maps and databases for joins with adjacent surveys. - The team compares findings with statements in the descriptive legend. Where problems are noted, it assists the staff in avoiding similar future problems. - The progress field review team reviews the recommendations of the soil survey staff for progressively correlating completed mapping. They make a record of the reasons for any correlation decisions and any work needed to update field sheets. - The review includes a check of all interpretations. The review team cross-checks field data, such as forestry productivity, for use. It recommends changes and additions to soil property records. - The review includes the quality and status of the descriptive legend and the soil survey handbook. The review team recommends revisions for the descriptive legend as necessary to meet the objective of the survey. - The review team checks the adequacy of field notes and the rate and progress of mapping and other scheduled survey activities. - The review team determines if action has been taken to correct deficiencies and complete items agreed upon that were noted in previous field reviews. (iv) Preparation of the Report.-The leader of the progress field review prepares a report of the review. The report includes a quality assurance worksheet (see part 609, subpart B, section 609.15) that has been approved by the SSR. In addition to the worksheet, the report includes the following: - A list of commendable activities of the soil scientists assigned to the survey area - A list of items agreed upon, persons assigned responsibility, and the dates for completion - A statement of the accuracy of map unit component and attribute data - A progress map - An updated list of the classification of taxa in the survey area - Notes recording important observations made during the field studies - A record of additions, deletions, or other changes to the descriptive legend - A complete updated identification legend - A letter transmitting the report to the MLRA soil survey leader and others as appropriate, in which the soil survey regional director highlights significant issues and items that are agreed upon - An evaluation and comments on the status of scheduled actions from earlier progress reviews</p></li>
<li><p>Final Field Reviews (i) The purpose of the final field review is to evaluate the entire survey to ensure that the work is of acceptable quality and to complete necessary modifications before field operations end. The final field review is held about 1 year before the completion of mapping in initial soil surveys. Part 609, subpart B, section 609.17, lists some important items to check before or during the final field review. (ii) Activities Completed Prior to the Final Field Review.-The activities include completing the mapping, checking the consistency and quality of mapping throughout the survey area, collecting soil sample and interpretation data for correlation, finishing the complete draft of the soil survey report and database entries, revising the U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2) database and (if one is to be prepared) the general soil map, completing laboratory analysis and soil investigations, providing correlated names and classifications for pedons in the laboratory database, taking photographs, and preparing illustrations. (iii) Conduct of the Review.-The major portion of the final field review occurs in the office. Field visits take place if needed. Those activities that were noted as needing corrective action during the last progress review receive special attention. Items scrutinized by the review team include the descriptive legend and supporting information; map unit names, composition, and associated data; the joining of the U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2) database; the draft soil survey report; and interpretative tables. (iv) Preparation of Report.-The leader of the final field review prepares a report.

<p>E. MLRA Soil Survey Quality Assurance Reviews</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>MLRA Soil Survey Progress Reviews (i) Progress field reviews emphasize evaluation of activities of the field staff to ensure that the staff are carrying out soil survey update activities as described in the project plan of operations for the area, that NCSS policy and procedures are followed, and that the completed work meets NCSS standards. They may also provide help to the staff on problems such as soil classification; updating of maps; data collection and analysis, storage, and retrieval; and soil interpretation. (ii) The frequency of progress reviews depends on the rate of progress, the complexity of the project area, and the kinds of update activities being conducted. Part 609, subpart B, section 609.18, lists some important items to check before and during project reviews. (iii) Conduct of the Review.-Activities are tailored to reflect the nature of the work being performed. Commonly, the review team spends part of the time in the field reviewing the collected soil data. They also examine digital maps for correct soil identification, proper placement of boundaries with landforms and imagery, and validity of models used in revising the soil maps. As necessary, the team concentrates on solutions to problems brought to their attention by the field staff or discovered during the review process. It checks the adequacy of documentation and the rate and progress of scheduled survey activities. It determines if action has been taken to correct deficiencies and complete items agreed upon that were noted in any previous field reviews. (iv) Preparation of the Report.-The leader of the project review prepares a report of the review. The report includes a quality assurance worksheet (see part 609, subpart B, section 609.19) that has been approved by the SSR. In addition to the worksheet, the report includes the following: - A list of commendable activities of the soil scientists assigned to the survey area - A list of items agreed upon, persons assigned responsibility, and the dates for completion - A statement of the accuracy of map unit component and attribute data - An updated list of the classification of taxa in the survey area - Notes recording important observations made during the field studies - A complete updated identification legend for the project area - A letter transmitting the report to the MLRA soil survey leader and others as appropriate, in which the soil survey regional director highlights significant issues and items that are agreed upon - An evaluation and comments on the status of scheduled actions from any earlier progress reviews</p></li>
<li><p>MLRA Soil Survey Completion Reviews (i) The purpose of the project completion review is to evaluate the activities to ensure that the work meets NCCS standards and to complete necessary modifications before individual project operations end. This review is held when activities described in the current plan of operations are nearing completion. Part 609, subpart B, section 609.18, lists some important items to check before or during the project review. (ii) Activities Completed Prior to Project Completion Reviews.-Activities include completing the digital revisions, checking consistency and quality of previous mapping throughout the project area, collecting soil sample and interpretation data for correlation, completing laboratory analysis and soil investigations, and providing correlated names and classification for all applicable pedons in the laboratory database. (iii) Conduct of the Review.-The major portion of the review occurs in the office. Field checks generally are covered under field assistance visits (see section 609.6). Those activities that were noted as needing corrective action during any project progress review receive special attention. Items scrutinized by the review team include supporting information, the validity of map units and their names, and the tabular database. A check is made to ensure that correlation decisions are recorded in NASIS. (iv) Preparation of Report.-The leader of the project completion review prepares a report. The report includes a quality assurance worksheet (see part 609, subpart B, section 609.19) that has been approved by the SSR. In addition to the worksheet, the report includes the following: - An identification legend of revised map units020 - A feature and symbol legend020 - A record of soil characterization samples that were collected for laboratory analysis in the survey area020 - A record of soil samples that were collected for engineering tests020 - A statement on the accuracy of map unit component and attribute data020 - An updated list of the classification of taxa in the survey area020 - A list of commendable activities of the soil survey office staff020 - A record of the decisions made during the review020 - A letter transmitting the report to the MLRA soil survey leader and others as appropriate, in which the soil survey regional director highlights significant issues and items that are agreed upon020 - An evaluation and comments on the status of scheduled actions from any earlier progress reviews020</p></li>

<p>F. Signature and Approval of Review Reports</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Review Team Leader.-The SSR, or a cooperating agency, leads the review and is responsible for preparing and signing all review reports and transmitting copies of the review report to the MLRA soil survey leader and others as appropriate. The soil survey regional director signs the transmittal letter.</p></li>
<li><p>Representatives of Cooperating Agencies.-The representatives may also sign all review reports, such as the quality assurance worksheet. When other partner agencies (for example, the U.S. Forest Service) lead the review, NRCS participates in a quality assurance role, which does not replace the responsibilities assigned to the partner agency. Field review reports and other documentation regarding survey quality on Federal land require the signature of a representative of the agency who participates in the review activity, or a designated representative of the agency, to document agreement or disagreement by signing the report.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>G. Distribution and Review of Review Reports The soil survey regional director distributes copies of all field reviews within 30 days after the final day of the review. The director sends at least one copy of the field review report and attachments and a letter of transmittal to the MLRA soil survey leader and others as appropriate, such as cooperating agencies and the State office in which the survey area resides.</p>

</h3>
<p>A. The SSR ensures the technical quality of general soil maps, index maps, and location maps. The general soil maps are optional in soil survey publications, but index maps and location maps are required. If a general soil map (GSM) is not to be included, cooperators should agree with the decision. Also, an up-to-date U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2) database map of the survey area should be readily available to the public. The availability of the U.S. General Soil Map should be noted in the publication, such as in the section "How To Use This Soil Survey."</p>
<p>B. General Soil Maps and Index Maps</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Each soil survey publication includes an index to map sheets, which is available from the NGCE staff. By request, a soil survey area subset of the U.S. General Soil Map is provided by NGCE as one of the map sources for the GSM. The other source for GSM development is SSURGO. NGCE assists in determining format and the number of maps needed. A draft of the general soil map developed from the U.S. General Soil Map or SSURGO and the associated legend are completed to the extent possible after correlation decisions have been finalized. The soil data quality specialist reviews the GSM and legend to verify that- (i) Soil map boundaries are accurate. (ii) GSM map unit names conform to the correlated names on the detailed maps. (iii) The map legend and manuscript are in agreement. (iv) The general soil map legend matches adjoining survey areas (this ensures that all delineations are closed and symbolized, that the area of each map unit compares with the percentage given for the survey area, and that the organization and levels of generalization of the map and legend are appropriate). (v) Map delineations and legends join the U.S. General Soil Map for adjacent surveys. (vi) If the percentage of each component in the GSM is given, the total acreage of each is not more than that in the acreage table for the detailed map units.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the draft general soil map is approved, the detailed soil legend and feature and symbol legend can be ordered. To order: (ii) Go to NGCE online at <a href="http://www.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/ncgcos/" class="external-link uri">http://www.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/ncgcos/</a>. (ii) Order the color check print of the general soil map, the index to map sheets, the feature and symbol legend, and the detailed soil legend. List the headnote to accompany the detailed soil legend if it is different from that shown in the final correlation memorandum. If the headnote is different, amend the final correlation memorandum to reflect the change. (iii) Indicate additional instructions for completing the order. Include special instructions needed by the cartographic staff to prepare the symbol legend. Show suggestions for colors identifying soil groupings or levels of generalization on the supplement or on the edited legend. Attach a copy of the final correlation memorandum and any amendments, the electronic file of the U.S. General Soil Map, and a copy of the edited general soil map legend to the order.</p></li>
<li><p>NGCE completes the order and sends the general soil map color check print, the index to map sheets, and the legends to the SSR for final review and approval. The SSR checks- (i) The GSM legend against the edited copy, (ii) The detailed soil map legend against the final correlation memorandum and any amendments. (iii) The names of cooperating agencies on maps and legends against the final correlation memorandum and any amendments. (iv) The name of the survey area on maps and legends against the final correlation memorandum and any amendments. (v) The conventional and special symbol legend for agreement with maps and the final correlation memorandum.</p></li>
<li><p>The SSR makes needed changes and corrections on the U.S. General Soil Map and returns them to NGCE. The NGCE staff makes the corrections identified.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>C. Location Maps Each soil survey publication requires a location map. This map shows the location of the survey area in the State. The SSR orders the location map at the time the soil survey manuscript is received for technical review. The NGCE staff prepares the location map.</p>

</h3>
<p>The following outline shows the order and character of items and data ordinarily contained in a correlation document. It does not preclude the inclusion of other information pertinent to the survey or the explanation of actions taken in the correlation. An example follows each item. 1. Heading UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Natural Resources Conservation Service Classification and Correlation of the Soil Survey of Any Area, Any MLRA, Any State The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is an equal opportunity provider and employer. 2. Introductory Paragraph In this paragraph cite persons participating in the correlation, the date, the location, data reviewed, the basis for the correlation, and other items if pertinent. For example: "John C. Smith, soil data quality specialist, and David G. White, MLRA soil survey leader, of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Joseph I. Black, associate professor, Anytown State University at Any Town, Any State, prepared this correlation the week of October 21-25, 2000. The soil survey database, soil survey publication, field notes, interpretations, laboratory data, correlation samples, field map sheets, and materials from the adjacent soil surveys provide the basis for this correlation." 3. Headnote for Detailed Soil Survey Legend This headnote is an explanation of the symbols on the detailed soil maps in the published survey. It appears on the SOIL LEGEND in the published report and precedes the list of map unit symbols and map unit names. For example: "Map unit symbols consist of numbers or a combination of numbers and letters. The initial numbers represent the kind of soil. A capital letter following these numbers indicates the class of slope. Map unit symbols without a slope letter indicate nearly level soils or miscellaneous areas." 4. Field and Publication Names and Symbols The correlation of soil map units is formatted into four columns. List map unit symbols for publication alphabetically or numerically in sequence. The heading and format are as follows: Field Map Field Map Publication Map Approved Map Unit Symbol Unit Name Unit Symbol Unit Name DeB Delta sandy loam, AbB Alpha sandy 2 to 6 percent loam, 2 to 6 slopes percent slopes Bf Beta mucky silt Be Beta silt loam loam GaB, Gamma silt loam, GaB Gamma silt GhB 2 to 6 percent loam, 2 to 6 slopes percent slopes 5. Series Established by This Correlation List the soil series established by this correlation. List in parentheses, after the series name, the county, the parish, or survey area and the State in which the type location occurs if the type location is in a soil survey area other than the one being correlated. For example: "The Alpha series is established by this correlation, the Alpha type location in the adjoining Beta County soil survey area, Any State." Enter "none" if no new series were established. 6. Series Dropped or Made Inactive by This Correlation List the tentative soil series that were dropped or the established soil series that were made inactive by the correlation. For example: "The Beta series is inactivated by this correlation." Enter "none" if no tentative series were dropped or no established soil series were made inactive. 7. Cooperators' Names and Credits List the following: The cooperators' names and credits to be given in the published soil survey. "United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service In cooperation with Anystate Agricultural Experiment Station Anystate Conservation Commission Anystate Cooperative Extension Service Any Soil and Water Conservation District" "This survey was made for Any Survey Area, Anystate, by the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Anystate Agricultural Experiment Station, Anystate Conservation Commission, and the Anystate Cooperative Extension Service. It is part of the technical assistance furnished to the Any Survey Area Soil and Water Conservation District. The Any Survey Area Board of Commissioners provided financial assistance for the survey." 8. Prior Soil Survey Publications Indicate the reference to prior soil survey publications that will appear in the introduction of the published soil survey. A prior published soil survey is a literature citation in the soil survey publication. For example: "The first soil survey for Any Survey Area, Anystate, was published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1903. Maps were printed in 1905. This soil survey is on an aerial photography base and contains more interpretative information." Enter "none" if there is no prior soil survey publication. 9. Miscellaneous Items Use the appropriate headings and include items pertinent to the correlation or publication of the survey. For example, the soil-vegetation-climate schema, or model, used to guide correlation for the survey area should be included. Other examples include a summary of soil temperature or moisture studies or special investigative reports that provided guidance for the survey area. 10. Instructions for Map Development These brief instructions should include: - Who is responsible for the development of digital spatial data - The date and projection of the orthophoto imagery being used for the base map - Who is responsible for digitizing the maps and when it is scheduled - Who is responsible for finishing the digital maps and when it is scheduled - Whether or not a layer for point and linear map units will be compiled and digitized - Any other instructions that may be relevant to the achieving a digital soils layers Detailed instructions for soil map data capture are found in part 647 of this handbook. 11. Feature and Symbol Legend Include a copy of form NRCS-SOI-37A and indicate the features and symbols that are used in the survey area by highlighting or underlining in red. For example: "Only those symbols indicated on the NRCS-SOI-37A will be shown on the legend." Complete the descriptions for standard landform and miscellaneous surface features and descriptions for ad hoc features on the back of the form for those features indicated. 12. General Soil Map Unit Legend List the general soil map units that will be shown on the legend of the general soil map of the survey area. For example: "The following map units will be used on the general soil map legend: Alpha-Beta to Alpha-Beta association Beta-Gamma-Zeta to Beta-Gamma-Zeta association." 13. Conversion Legend List all field symbols and their approved publication symbols. A conversion legend is not needed if field symbols and publication symbols are identical. For example: CONVERSION LEGEND, ANY SURVEY AREA, ANYSTATE Field Publication Field Publication Symbol Symbol Symbol Symbol 7A 7A 20B 20B 7B 7B 21C 21D 7C 7C 21E 21E 14. Legend of Map Units in Alphabetical Sequence This legend is used only where numeric symbols will be published to assist publication crosschecking. For example: LEGEND OF MAP UNITS IN ALPHABETICAL SEQUENCE, ANY SURVEY AREA, ANYSTATE Publication Symbol Approved Map Unit Name 43 Alpha clay 37 Beta clay loam, 5 to 9 percent slopes, eroded 39 Beta clay loam, 9 to 14 percent slopes, eroded 15. Classification of Pedons Sampled for Laboratory Analysis This table lists pedons that have laboratory data or engineering test data. Give the source of the data and other pertinent information. In the table "Publication Symbols," refer to the map symbol that identifies the area from which the sample was taken. Additional columns can be added if needed. CLASSIFICATION OF PEDONS SAMPLED FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS Approved Series Soil Survey Publication Name or Class Sampled as Sample No.Â Symbol Identification 1. Laboratory Data from the NSSC Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Alpha S79AS-047-003 AbB Alpha Beta S79AS-047-004 GbB Gamma 2. Laboratory Data from the Anystate Agricultural Experiment Station Laboratory Beta S79AS-047-005 BgB Beta Gamma S79AS-047-006 AaA Alpha 3. Laboratory Data from the Anystate Highway Department Laboratory Alpha S79AS-047-007 AaA Alpha Beta S79AS-047-008 BbC Beta 16. Sampled Pedons in Published Soil Survey Report This table lists the pedons and laboratory data that will be included in the published soil survey report. These pedons should represent the typical pedon for the series in the survey area. If the pedon is not the typical pedon for the series in the survey area, place a tabular or semi-tabular description in the soil survey report. Series Sample No.Â Status Alpha S79AS-047-003 Typical pedon for the Alpha in the survey area. Alpha S79AS-047-011 Typical pedon from map unit Aa. 17. Notes to Accompany the Classification and Correlation of the Soils in the Survey Area Notes of general explanation that contribute to the understanding of the correlation can be included as an introductory paragraph. For example: "This survey area is in a transitional zone of soil temperature regimes. Soils with mesic and thermic temperature regimes have been correlated." In the notes, include items such as: (a) Pertinent information about series being established. For example: "Alpha Series. The Alpha series is established by this correlation for soils that were formerly mapped as Beta but that have mixed mineralogy rather than siliceous mineralogy as defined for Beta." (b) How taxadjuncts differ from the series concept. For example: "Gamma Taxadjunct. This soil is a taxadjunct to the Gamma series because it contains less than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine. The soil classifies as coarse-silty." (c) A correlation note for soils that are slightly outside the official series range, but are not taxadjuncts. For example: "Beta soils in this survey have a redder subsoil and are slightly more acid throughout than those defined in the OSDs. These differences do not affect taxonomic placement or use and management. The OSD was not revised because the color and reaction differences are due to the inherent characteristics of the Theta geologic formation in which these soils formed and which is not the typical formation in which the Beta series formed." 18. Classification of the Soils This table lists the classification of the taxonomic units that are used in the survey area. Classify taxonomic units that are named at a level above the series as precisely as the data permits. Designate taxadjuncts with an asterisk only if the representative pedon is a taxadjunct. Address map units with major components that are taxadjuncts in the "notes." Do not list miscellaneous area names in the classification table. For example: CLASSIFICATION OF THE SOILS OF ANY SURVEY AREA, ANYSTATE Soil Name Family or Higher Taxonomic Class Alpha Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Aridic Haploxerolls Beta Fine-silty, mixed, active, frigid Cumulic Epiaquolls Gamma* Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Dystric Eutrudepts Udorthents Udorthents *Taxadjunct. See "Notes to Accompany Classification and Correlation of the Soils of Any Survey Area, Anystate" for details. 19. Join Statement The join statement prepared at the final field review is included. It explains where an exact join was not achieved and identifies what map units need review and their joins resolved. 20. Certifications The correlation document is to contain certification of the following: (a) Mapping is complete. For example: "Mapping completed in June 1999." (b) General soil maps and detailed maps join exactly with those of adjacent survey areas, and detailed maps join within the survey area. Discrepancies in the join of maps with those of adjacent areas are documented, and a detailed statement of join differences is referenced and included in the correlation document. The reason the maps cannot be joined is given in the join statement. (c) Databases and interpretations are coordinated and complete. For example: "Databases and interpretations are coordinated, map unit lines of adjoining surveys are continuous across and along the shared borders, and the joined map units share basic soil properties and selected soil qualities. All data elements are populated and no obsolete terms are used." (d) Type locations are in soil areas that have the referenced names, and location descriptions are correct. For example: "The locations of all typical pedons used in this survey are within the major land resource area, are correct, and are within delineations that have the referenced name." (e) Forestland and rangeland site plots were taken in soil areas that have the referenced series names, the series names have been correlated in the forestland and rangeland databases, and all data is certified. (f) All typical pedons are classified according to Soil Taxonomy, 2nd edition and the latest edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. For example: "All typical pedons are correctly classified according to Soil Taxonomy, 2nd edition and the latest edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy." (g) Only approved names for miscellaneous areas have been used as component names, as specified in Part 627, Exhibit 627-1, of this handbook. (h) The soil maps have been reviewed for completeness, accuracy, and consistency. For example: "The soil maps are complete, accurate, and consistent." 21.

List in the narrative the specific technical training needs of soil survey staff not already identified by the local staff as part of their development plans. CORRELATION and DESCRIPTIVE LEGEND All map units correlated must have data to support the correlation-if not from the subset, then from the MLRA. The MLRA concept must be used for developing the legend. One legend is maintained for the survey containing the provisional and the approved map units for the MLRA. The legend is the official, progressively correlated subset legend of the MLRA. The map units in the legend have been approved by the SSR. The legend contains "provisional" map units that are being mapped but have insufficient acreage or documentation. The type and amount of documentation required for the map units to become approved depends on the complexity of the map unit, existing documentation for the map unit within the MLRA, and previous correlation decisions. Attach the legend. Include a list of map units added, dropped, or changed since the last review. Summarize the documentation gathered and provide a narrative of the field stops seen on this review. ______ Is documentation sufficient for approved data map units on the legend? ______ Do all new series components of map units to be added to the legend classify properly in accordance with the current edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy? ______ Are the properties (representative values) of all new components of map units as mapped in the survey area within the range of the named series? ______ Are the OSDs up-to-date and contain current data for all series used in the survey area (e.g., typical pedon georeferenced, taxonomic classification, metric units of measure, horizon designations, competing series section, diagnostic horizons and features listed)? ______ Have names for new series been reserved in the Soil Classification Database (SC Database) accompanied by an OSD uploaded to the OSD file share? ______ Are the map unit names and design consistent with the MLRA soil survey area for this initial soil survey? ______ Are all proposed changes in the legend recorded and reported in the appropriate NASIS tables? ______ Are notes recorded in NASIS detailing the location and acreage of provisional map units until they are approved for the ID legend? ______ Is a strategy in place for gathering documentation and are there instructions as to kind and quality of field notes needed? ______ Does each project member have an up-to-date copy of the descriptive legend? ______ Is the descriptive legend adequate to ensure consistency of the mapping by all project members and to ensure a timely completion of the publication? ______ Are the pedon descriptions stored in NASIS? ______ Are field notes, transect data, and laboratory data summarized regularly?

<h3 id="definition-and-purpose-1">610.0 Definition and Purpose<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#definition-and-purpose-1"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition. The update of soil survey is a systematic process designed to improve official soil survey information (see General Manual, Title 430, Part 402, Section 402.5(A)) with consideration of the full extent of soils and ecological sites across a major land resource area (MLRA) (see Part 649, Subpart A, Section 649.2 of this handbook). Updating by MLRA is a continuous activity of inventory and assessment, data collection, synthesis, review, and recertification of existing soil survey and ecological site information that brings all information to a common standard. The MLRA soil survey update is planned and organized using scheduled projects that systematically focus on specific groups of soils or landforms and the associated support data, interpretations, and maps.</p>
<p>B. Purpose. The MLRA process will develop a seamless coverage of consistent soil survey and ecological site information across the Nation. Updating soil survey and ecological site information by MLRA ensures that appropriately detailed information which meets user needs is developed and delivered in a timely manner. Project plans are created and coordinated across the existing (i.e., traditional or non-MLRA) soil survey area boundaries and follow natural landforms. The MLRA process facilitates mapping, interpreting, and delivering seamless soil survey and ecological site information across broad geographical areas of common resource values, land uses, and management concerns.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="inventory-and-assessment">610.2 Inventory and Assessment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#inventory-and-assessment"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition. An inventory and assessment is an analysis of the SSURGO-certified map units (see Part 647, Section 647.03 of this handbook) within an MLRA. The existing soil survey and ecological site data is inventoried and analyzed to determine completeness, accuracy, continuity, and appropriateness for current land management decisions within the MLRA. This information will be used to prioritize work on map units and document the need for future MLRA update projects.</p>
<p>B. Purpose. The inventory and assessment identifies deficiencies and improvements needed in the official soil survey information, including ecological site information. This inventory is necessary to develop the long-range plan report.</p>
<p>C. Procedure. Information is gleaned from a variety of sources (see Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.12). Information may come from those who actively participated in developing the initial soil survey or from NCSS partners and users of the information. Major information items to be considered in the inventory and assessment are listed in Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.11. The inventory and assessment may be repeated as needed to address emerging user needs and land use changes.</p>
<p>D. Documentation. All documentation is managed in NASIS. The information gathered is compiled for each map unit. The taxa used in the map unit name and individual delineations of the map unit are evaluated. The results of the inventory and assessment are entered into the NASIS database (see Part 638 of this handbook) in the Mapunit Text table under the specific map unit(s). All notes entered into the Mapunit Text table should be populated with- - Kind set to "miscellaneous notes," - Category set to "evaluation notes," and - Subcategory set to "spatial," "attribute," or "interpretation." Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.13 provides a sample evaluation worksheet and an example of evaluation notes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="update-strategies">610.3 Update Strategies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#update-strategies"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition. Strategies to update existing soil survey and ecological site information are designed to make efficient use of staff resources and their time. They address the deficiency(ies) identified by the inventory and assessment. They can address updating soil survey and ecological site information individually or concurrently or integrate multiple projects to address data issues for a geographic area.</p>
<p>B. Purpose. Strategies provide the tactical framework from which to initiate, conduct, and deliver updated soil survey and ecological site information to users under the auspices of the National Cooperative Soil Survey program. Key projects, milestones, and resource concerns are identified in the long-range plan and annual plan of operations.</p>
<p>C. Policy. There are four soil survey update strategies. These strategies allow for a mixture of concurrent projects in order to achieve efficient operation and timely reporting of updated soil survey information. All soil survey update activity will encompass the map unit or landform as it occurs in the MLRA. The NASIS Project object is used to manage MLRA updates. The update strategy selected for a project should be identified in the project description. Project milestones are used to manage tasks and document progress. Project concern types are used to identify the agency resource concerns (see Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.10). For detailed information on population of the NASIS project, see Chapter 14 of the NASIS User Guide (available on the NASIS webpage).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><pre><code> MLRA assessment and correlation This strategy compiles historical documentation and uses limited field time to reconcile map unit names, map unit composition, and component and horizon properties for developing a seamless coverage of soil survey and ecological site information. It will be applied to all map units. The process focuses on reducing the number of duplicative map unit information for soil map units that have the same map unit concept. It reconciles map units that represent a continuation of mapping concepts across non-MLRA soil survey area boundaries. A single MLRA map unit is created with fully populated properties, qualities, and interpretations for components and horizons. This process is the underpinning of MLRA correlation. Reportable acres are 20 percent of the total project map unit acres. Projects are goaled and reported within the assigned fiscal year. The MLRA assessment and correlation strategy: (i)     Bridges the inventory and assessment and the MLRA field project using information obtained from the map unit inventory and assessment to readily accomplish MLRA correlation and database population; (ii)     Uses existing soil survey information and correlation documents in conjunction with limited field visits; (iii) Relies on the experience and knowledge of technical team members; (iv) Ensures that same-named and similarly named map units are reviewed and that duplicate map units with the same map unit concept are correlated into a single map unit that extends seamlessly across political boundaries; (v) Requires map unit names to be correlated to common MLRA phase criteria; (vi) Contains a project name beginning with the prefix \"SDJR - MLRA XXX - &lt;project name&gt;\"; and (vii) Assists staff in identifying additional MLRA field projects.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>MLRA field projects MLRA field projects collect additional data necessary to re-correlate map units; document and populate soil properties, qualities, and interpretations; and update the spatial data to bring all soil survey information on a specific map unit or landform to a common and current standard. A \"map unit\" approach is effective when the update need is to collect data to fill voids in the data mapunit or to determine map unit composition. A \"landform\" approach is effective in areas where current mapping concepts or soil survey maps are inconsistent. The result is a seamless coverage of attribute and spatial data across political boundaries within the MLRA. MLRA field projects involve the field collection of data or spatial revision that is beyond the scope of MLRA assessment and correlation, as described in Section 610.3(C)(1). MLRA field projects are intended to address most, if not all, of the prioritized update needs identified during the inventory and assessment. Reportable acres are 100 percent of the total project map unit acres. An MLRA field project requires, and is focused on, the results of an inventory and assessment. It identifies the project concern and collects the necessary documentation to address the agency resource concerns. It focuses on a single map unit concept or landform or on multiple map unit concepts and a catena or landform. Timeframes range from weeks to as much as 2 years, depending on the project size and extent. Extensive update needs are to be addressed on a map unit or landform basis. Key update issues must be identified in the inventory and assessment. The work is then prioritized and ranked. Proposed project plans are developed and included in the long-range plan report. These projects are addressed within the confines of an approved MLRA project and contained within its timelines. Assistance from National Cooperative Soil Survey partners may be necessary or desired for extensive updates. Extensive updates must be reviewed and prioritized by the management team and board of advisors based on the overall needs of the entire MLRA soil survey area. Updated soil survey information is supported by the documentation requirements as given in Part 627, Section 627.08 of this handbook. Approval to conduct any extensive revision must be obtained from the Director of the Soil Science Division (refer to General Manual, Title 430, Part 402, Subpart A, Section 402.5(C)). The project evaluation is submitted as supporting documentation.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Special investigations and/or monitoring Special investigations or monitoring programs are designed to answer specific questions about a particular soil, a catena of soils across the landscape, or regional questions regarding geology, climate, or plant communities. They are undertaken in order to clarify or augment existing soil survey or ecological site information used in update projects. These studies may address hydric soils, saturated soil layers, saturated hydraulic conductivity, chemistry or mineralogy, climate, dynamic soil properties, and other site- specific soil conditions. Consideration should be given to involving NCSS partners, adjoining soil survey offices, and staff of the National Soil Survey Center (NSSC) and Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL). Such involvement should be designed to reduce the local workload, shorten the time required to complete, or bring expertise to support the project. Special investigations are a milestone activity within a MLRA field project. An investigation plan is developed by the soil survey leader in consultation with the regional office, NSSC liaison, and partner agencies. Investigation plans are written in the Project Text table (see Section 610.4(C)). Progress and reportable acres are managed in the associated MLRA field project. Most special investigations should focus upon soils or conditions occurring extensively within the MLRA, so that findings can be applied to similar adjacent soils and ecological sites. Those for soils with limited extent should address issues critical to interpretation or management of these areas. The milestone \"Scheduled Completion Date\" for some special investigations and monitoring activities may extend beyond the \"Scheduled Completion Date\" for the associated MLRA field project. In these cases, the MLRA field project can still be completed and acres reported if all other milestone activities are accomplished. Once the special investigation or monitoring activity is complete, the information gained can be used to refine the map unit data. The project acres, however, are not reported a second time.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Supplemental mapping Supplemental mapping provides a more detailed order of soil survey (order 1 or 2), including the soil map and attribute data, and requires more intensive onsite investigations. (i)     Mapping that provides order 1 detail within a higher order soil survey.-This produces a separate soil map for specific planning needs of limited extent. It is maintained as improved documentation and attribute data but is not considered a change to the official soil survey information (see General Manual, Title 430, Subpart A, Section 402.5(F)). This method of supplemental mapping is conducted, and reported, as a Technical Soil Service activity for a specific customer and managed as a site-specific investigation (see Part 629 of the Technical Soil Services Handbook for more information). Results can be referenced in the long-range plan and captured as pedon information in the NASIS database to serve as additional documentation to support future update projects. Progress is reported through the NASIS Technical Soil Service table. (ii) Mapping that provides order 2 detail within a higher order survey.- This is managed within the confines of an approved MLRA field project to address the prioritized update need. For example, an area within the MLRA previously mapped at order 3 detail could be mapped to order 2 detail utilizing mapping concepts from surrounding areas and field visits to ground truth decisions. Supplemental mapping is often performed at the request of partners and land management agencies requiring more detailed information to address management needs. The resulting information is official soil survey data and is delivered to the Web Soil Survey. Progress and reportable acres are managed in the associated MLRA field project.</code></pre></li>

<p>A. Definition. The project plan details work activities necessary to address deficiencies and improve soil survey and ecological site information on an MLRA-wide basis. All projects are managed in the NASIS database. Projects are developed from the information gathered during the inventory and assessment. The project milestones and goals are used to manage project completion with available resources in a timely manner.</p>
<p>B. Purpose. The project identifies specific soil map units, geographic areas, landforms, soil catena, or soil properties to be investigated for improving the official soil survey information. It manages the timeframe and coordinates strategies to be employed, resources required, investigations needed, and quality control and quality assurance activities. Project plans may take on various forms depending on the update strategy (see Section 610.3). The project objective is the publication of seamless soil survey information that is accurate, complete, and consistent to meet user needs across the MLRA. The updated information is correlated into soil survey legends and published to the Web Soil Survey via the Soil Data Mart.</p>
<p>C. Development.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><pre><code> Project plans are developed for the approved and prioritized update needs identified in the long-range plan. The Project object is populated using the Project Plan Checklist (see Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.14) and the process steps found in Chapter 14 of the NASIS User Guide (available on the NASIS webpage). The Project Plan is a NASIS report extracting data entered in the Project object and requires: (i)     A project description containing an initial summary paragraph followed by project details, including objective, procedures, project extent, timeframe, benefits, outcome, deliverables, and travel budget; (ii) Map units that will be updated; (iii) Staff, including all field, regional, State, and national personnel who will provide time and resources; (iv) A project mapping goal based on the sum of the project map unit acres; (v) Concerns that address agency resource concerns (see Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.10); and (vi) Project milestones necessary to manage a project.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code> Soil survey investigations may be needed as part of the MLRA field project plan. The investigation plan is developed by the soil survey leader in consultation with the regional office, NSSC liaison, and/or partner agencies. Investigation plans are included in the Project object: (i)     The NSSC liaison is added as a project staff member. (ii) The investigation plan is written in the Project Text table: - The Kind column is populated as \"project plan.\" - The Category column is populated as \"KSSL.\" - The Text column stores the investigation plan. (See Part 631 of this handbook for more information on soil survey investigations.) (iii) The milestone \"KSSL Investigation Plan\" is included in the Project Milestone table. \"Scheduled Start Date\" and \"Scheduled Completion Date\" are populated to assist staff in scheduling.</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Managing Spatial Data. Spatial adjustments (e.g., map unit polygon line adjustments, adjustments to delineations so they coincide better with landforms, map unit symbol changes, spot symbol changes) can be made during the normal course of work for a project. Spatial updates that contribute to updating the soil survey on a MLRA basis are handled within the confines of MLRA field projects. The spatial update needs are identified in the MLRA inventory and assessment, prioritized and ranked, developed into proposed project plans along with attribute update needs, included in the long-range plan, and addressed within the confines of approved projects and their timelines. Adjustments to lines in areas beyond the boundaries of project map units are not considered. Analysis of map unit delineations is made at publication scale. Digital line editing will follow digital soil mapping standards as addressed in Part 647 of this handbook.</p>
<p>E. Approval Process. The SSO submits proposed project plans to the regional office for preliminary review. Next, they go to the management team for review, comment, and concurrence. The soil survey regional director approves project plans based on management team recommendations and informs the SSO to mark accepted plans as approved in NASIS. The SSO then begins conducting the approved projects.</p>

<h3 id="prioritizing-and-ranking">610.5 Prioritizing and Ranking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prioritizing-and-ranking"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition. Future projects (update needs), including those identified during the SDJR Initiative, are prioritized and ranked in order to help balance local needs with those of the Nation, State(s), NCSS partners, and agency. Input from technical team members is used in determining local priorities. The local issues are merged with the priorities of the Nation, State(s), NCSS partners, and agency that were identified during work planning conferences.</p>
<p>B. Purpose. The purpose of prioritizing and ranking is to efficiently utilize SSO staff and permit timely reporting of progress. Agency resource concerns, project cost and benefit, ease or difficulty of project effort, acres impacted, staff capabilities, and equitable assistance to users are among the various factors considered in prioritizing projects. Prioritizing and ranking focuses agency resources on highest priority update needs.</p>
<p>C. Prioritizing and ranking considerations. Priority status for update needs is evaluated annually. The scientific merit, external merit, internal merit, financial/partnership inputs, and efficiency are used in the ranking process. Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.15 (Example of a Project Evaluation Ranking Procedure) can be used to create a soil survey office area ranking and prioritizing formula. A ranking procedure that evaluates the need and importance of individual projects, especially projects that require substantial resources, aids in prioritization of staff and resources. Soil survey offices should periodically review their ranking procedures to ensure that they are addressing important issues and are consistent across the soil survey office area. Ranking criteria are created to defend ranking decisions. Each soil survey office will have unique issues to consider when developing ranking criteria. Items to consider when ranking projects include: - Status of initial soil surveys and the specific map units requiring re-correlation - Age of the survey and soil series and issues with the series concept or classification - Agency resource concerns for addressing Farm Bill and technical or financial assistance (see Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.10) - Program and project needs of cooperating agencies - Requests by local constituents and frequency of complaints or appeals - Needs of Federal partners regarding Federal lands - Information that aids in land use planning and decisions, such as tax evaluation consistency - Rapid land use changes in areas where critical soil problems are expected - Cost share contributions of funds or staffing - Other factors of specific local importance - Survey boundary join status - Consistency in map unit kind (phases, taxadjuncts, miscellaneous units) - Consistency of the soil property data - Interpretive issues - Number of acres affected - Spatial line placement and conflicts with the landscape model - Amount of KSSL lab data - Benchmark status of the series</p>
<p>D. Process. After the technical team and soil survey office have prioritized and ranked all future projects, the soil survey office leader populates the priority in the "user project identification" column. The SSO then proceeds with developing the long-range plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="long-range-plan">610.6 Long-Range Plan<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#long-range-plan"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition. A long-range plan presents future update activities based upon a continuation of current trends and needs. In an MLRA soil survey update, the long-range plan report is used to document the status of current soil survey and ecological site projects and identify emerging information needs.</p>
<p>B. Purpose. The long-range plan report is a succinct document presenting the prioritized projects from the NASIS Project object. It is designed to maintain effective and efficient soil survey area resource workload and is available to the management team and board of advisors using the Soil Science Division Management Reports webpage. The long-range plan provides the framework for the MLRA update process and SSO operations. It assists in the logical creation of shorter term MLRA field projects and ecological site projects with specific objectives, goals, strategies, and milestones.</p>
<p>C. Development. The SSO staff, with input from the technical team, uses the results of the inventory and assessment to populate the NASIS Project object with information necessary to prepare a long-range plan report. The report is used to assist stakeholders in understanding the value and condition of the soil survey and ecological site information. It presents the work necessary to improve existing soil survey and ecological site information and maps. The NASIS national report "PROJECT - Soil Survey Office Long Range Plan" extracts specific project information from survey office projects. Major data fields used in building the long-range plan report are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><pre><code> Project table (iv) User Project Identification column.-This is populated with the proposed SSO and technical team priority. The priority (see Section 610.5(d)) is populated based on region guidance, such as the four-digit fiscal year and the priority number (e.g., 2018-1). (v) Project name.-This is populated with the type of project, the MLRA, and the project name (e.g., MLRA 133B - Cahaba fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes). Specific population guidance is found in Chapter 14 of the NASIS User Guide. (vi) Project Description column.-This includes an initial summary paragraph, limited to 1000 characters, that provides managers with an overview of the project. Additional project information is populated after the summary paragraph. Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.14 provides guidance for preparing the project description. Section 610.16 offers examples of the project summary. (vii) Project Approved? box.-This is left unchecked unless the project has received prior approval from the management team. (viii) MLRA Soil Survey Office Area.-This is populated with the MLRA SSO area responsible for the project.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Project Mapunit table.-This is populated with the map units associated with the project.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Project Mapping Goal table.-This can be populated with the proposed year in which the project will begin but it is not required. If populated, the information will appear on the Long Range Plan report.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Project Concern Need table.-The Project Concern Type column is populated with the agency resource concern that the project is designed to address (see Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.10).</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Project Milestone table.-The Milestone Type Name column is populated with the \"Future Project\" milestone and the proposed \"Scheduled Start Date\" date.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Project Land Category Breakdown table.-\"Land Category Acres\" is populated with the sum of map unit acres associated by land category for the project.</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>D. Publication. The NASIS long-range plan report is accessed as a NASIS report or from the Soil Science Division Management Reports webpage. The long-range plan is used by national managers, management teams, and technical teams to review the prioritized update needs (refer to Part 608, Section 608.05(d) of this handbook).</p>
<p>E. Approval of project priorities. The SSO notifies the soil survey regional director that the project plans have been populated and available for review in the long-range plan report. The soil survey regional director distributes the report to the management teams for their review, comments, recommendations, and concurrence. The comments from the management team are returned to the soil survey regional director. After review, the soil survey regional director notifies the SSO to finish developing the approved project plans. This process is repeated when update needs change or when work is scheduled for a different work period. The scheduled start date and scheduled completion date are updated to reflect SSR approval. The long-range plan is a dynamic document that is reviewed annually by the SSO and maintained as work progresses or concludes, needs emerge, agency priorities shift, or special initiatives are undertaken that impact workload planning. The technical team and management team remain involved in the development and adjustment of the long-range plan.</p>

<h3 id="annual-plan-of-operation-apo">610.7 Annual Plan of Operation (APO)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#annual-plan-of-operation-apo"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition. Annual plans of operation (aka business plans) are developed to guide and provide specific focus to staff as projects are being implemented in accordance with the long-range plan. An APO is developed by the SSO each fiscal year and designed to identify staff, projects, goals, milestones, objectives, timelines, and responsibilities to guide the staff in planning day-to-day operations to complete the targeted work. See Part 608 of this handbook for more information.</p>
<p>B. Purpose. APOs are developed, managed, and implemented by SSO staff. The APO incorporates the variety of MLRA project plans being managed during the course of the fiscal year. The list of needs and priorities may change with time (according to Farm Bill priorities, cost share opportunities, etc.), and flexibility should be maintained for possible adjustments within this process.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><pre><code>  The APO should account for all projects and staff activities, including field mapping and investigations, database maintenance, formal and informal training, technical soil services, technical and management team meetings, staff meetings, and personnel management (leave) and supervision.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>  The APO is maintained and adjusted for the gains or losses in staffing at the SSO.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>  NASIS reports are available to assist in the development of the APO.</code></pre></li>

<h3 id="certification-of-soils-data">610.8 Certification of Soils Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#certification-of-soils-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>A. Definition. Data certification is a three-step process for ensuring that project attribute and spatial information are accurate, complete, and meet NCSS standards. The soil survey office leader begins the certification process with a quality control review (see Part 609, Subpart A, Section 609.4 of this handbook and Exhibit A, National Instruction 430-305) of new or edited attribute and spatial data. The second certification step is a project quality assurance review by the SSR (Part 609, Subpart A, Section 609.5) where the project information is reviewed and ultimately correlated into the appropriate legends. Quality control and quality assurance reviews are described in Part 609 of this handbook. The final certification step is the state office review of the attribute and spatial information and the SSURGO (Part 647, Section 647.01(B)(6) of this handbook) and legend certification (Part 609, Subpart A, Section 609.1) by the state soil scientist.</p>
<p>B. Purpose. The data certification process ensures that all significant changes to any previously certified database are reviewed, documented, and recorded. By exporting the data (attribute and spatial), the State is certifying that the information posted to the Soil Data Warehouse has passed SSO quality control and SSR quality assurance inspections, meets National Cooperative Soil Survey standards, and is suitable for use by the general public. Progressive soil correlation, quality control, and quality assurance are essential and integral tools in data certification. These processes are used throughout the progression of a soil survey update project.</p>
<p>C. Data Documentation. The certification of attribute data is documented in NASIS. This documentation includes quality control and quality assurance reviews of changes made to the previously certified survey. Changes to an attribute dataset and what was actually changed are documented in export metadata. Procedures for certifying and documenting changes to a spatial dataset are discussed in Part 647 of this handbook. The certification level is assigned to the data mapunit, legend, and export for the particular soil survey area. It indicates the degree of confidence with which the new information may be used. As new records are created, the previous records are retained in order to maintain a certification history. The following NASIS tables are used for recording certification:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><pre><code>  Data Mapunit Certification History table.-This records information about the review and certification of data in the Data Mapunit object. The completion of quality control reviews is recorded by the MLRA soil survey leader. The completion of quality assurance reviews is recorded by the SSR staff. A level of certification is assigned to the data mapunit. This level indicates whether or not the data mapunit should be used and the degree of confidence with which it may be used. This certification relates to the whole data mapunit, including all of its components, horizons, etc.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>  Legend Certification History table.-This records information about the review and certification of data in the Legend object. The SSR certifies completion of quality assurance reviews, and a level of certification is assigned to the legend. This level indicates whether or not the legend should be used and the degree of confidence with which it may be used. The state soil scientist certifies legends by populating the Legend Export Certification History table identifying the modification to the legend by the project.</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>Legend Export Certification History table.-This records information about the export of all data associated with a legend, including map units, soil property data, and interpretations. A level of certification is assigned by the state soil scientist to the export package for a particular soil survey area. Information on the reason for changes to a dataset and what was actually changed are documented in narrative text notes (export metadata). The export metadata explains to customers the changes made in the survey area.</code></pre></li>

<h3 id="publication-of-soils-data">610.9 Publication of Soils Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#publication-of-soils-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>Following certification of attribute and spatial data, the final step is the export of the soil survey legends to the staging server by the state soil scientist and the export of the soil survey spatial databases by the regional office to the staging server. The state soil scientist verifies the spatial and attribute databases on the staging server. After verification, the databases are then committed to the Soil Data Warehouse. The version with the most recent time stamped is forwarded to the Soil Data Mart. The databases are committed to the Soil Data Warehouse as frequently as needed to meet NRCS or cooperator needs. The annual publication to the Web Soil Survey refresh (see Part 644 of this handbook) occurs in the first week of October.</p>

</h3>
<p>This worksheet should be tailored for the MLRA soil survey area. An effective worksheet identifies key items for evaluation and assists with an organized and consistent review of map units. The information gathered on this worksheet should be used for the evaluation of each map unit, the evaluation of the taxa used in the map unit name, and the evaluation of individual delineations of the map unit. This information should be collected and analyzed and a summarized paragraph entered into the NASIS database (see part 638 of this handbook) in the Mapunit Text table under the appropriate map unit(s). All notes entered into the Mapunit Text table should be populated with Kind set to "miscellaneous notes," Category set to "evaluation notes," and Subcategory set to "spatial," "attribute," or "interpretation." A variety of national NASIS reports named "MLRA - mgmt - XXX" can be used to create the evaluation report. Part A. Evaluation of the survey area Summarize the information from the non-MLRA survey areas occurring within the update project: How were the soil maps digitized? What is the new base map for the update? What is the new map scale? What additional soil data have users requested? What additional interpretations have users requested? Briefly describe the investigative and laboratory support needed to provide the new data and interpretations. Briefly describe how this survey will be improved by the update. Briefly describe any publication plans in addition to the Web Soil Survey. Part B. Evaluation of the map unit (subcategory "attribute") Give the probable map unit name if re-correlated. Do map unit names correspond with current NCSS and editorial standards? Is the unit adequately described? If not, what is inadequate? Does the map unit design meet current user needs within the MLRA? Are limiting dissimilar soils named as minor map unit components in NASIS? Is the amount and type of minor components consistent with NSSH guidelines? What were the major interpretive uses of the map unit at the time it was correlated? What is the major interpretive use of the map unit at the time of evaluation? Are soil properties consistent with the needs of the current land use? Are soil property entries in the NASIS database complete? Part C. Evaluation of the map unit components used to name the map unit (subcategory "attribute") Is the proper component kind value entered for the component? Does the component name and/or taxonomic classification need to be updated? If so, what is the proposed new name or taxonomic classification? Do miscellaneous area names correspond to the approved list of miscellaneous areas? Are component names properly entered with only the component name and in title case (e.g., Jonus)? Are phase criteria properly entered in the local phase column? Can the soil component be classified as presently described? If no, why not? Does the depth of the typifying pedon meet current needs? Does the series (taxa), as described, overlap with other series (taxa)? If yes, how? Does the typical pedon represent the map unit component? Is there lab data for the series (taxa)? If yes, how many locations were tested and is the data adequate? Do the component properties concur with characterization data? Is the representative pedon within the RIC of the OSD? If not, why? Is the series consistent with parent material? Is the series consistent with geomorphic landform? Is the series consistent with geographic setting and the MLRA? Part D. Evaluation of the map unit delineations (subcategory "spatial") Do soil lines fit major landform breaks? Do lines correctly separate map units in the soil landform? Is there a need to create new map units to delineate dissimilar soils? Are dissimilar soils consistent with the map unit description? Is the intensity of mapping suitable for the land use? Does the series concept, as correlated, fit the map unit concept? How was the mapping evaluated? Are there user comments? What are the number of: transects ________ field notes ________ descriptions ________ areas that need remapping ________ areas that need road checking for line placement ________ Is there an exact join with surrounding surveys? Is soil mapping consistently applied to landscapes across the major land resource area? Does the use of features and symbols reflect current definitions and follow standards on the Feature and Symbol Legend for Soil Survey, NRCS-SOI-37A? Will this map unit require extensive revision (remapping)? Part E. Evaluation of map unit interpretations (subcategory "interpretation") Address the interpretation issues within the survey manuscript. Identify interpretation join issues of similar map units across survey boundaries. Example report: Area Area Mapunit Mapunit Kind Category Subcategory Text Entry Symbol Name Symbol Name AL007 Bibb FuD Fullerton Miscellaneous evaluation attribute The manuscript identifies several County, gravelly notes notes dissimilar soils and states that Alabama silt loam, they occupy 20 total percent; 6 to 15 howeve,r no information is percent provided in the database. The slopes population of soil properties are not complete to NI305 Exhibit A population standards. The component name and taxonomic Area Area Mapunit Mapunit Kind Category Subcategory Text Entry Symbol Name Symbol Name classification need to be updated to current standards. Five KSSL sites exist but none from this survey area. One (Madison Co, AL) fits the Fullerton OSD very well. Three others deviate from the OSD slightly in fragment and/or clay content, but are within acceptable margins of error to use as reference data. One is a Kandiudult. Fullerton is a benchmark soil and additional characterization sampling is needed. The component properties do concur with characterization data. AL007 Bibb FuD Fullerton Miscellaneous evaluation interpretation The interpretive focus on this County, gravelly notes notes map unit is agriculture, Alabama silt loam, woodland, and residential and 6 to 15 low-density urban development. percent In review of the interpretations slopes during SDJR with similar named map units, the major interpretation discrepancy is slope phases that must be reconciled for the MLRA. Once a decision on slope phase is made, the interpretations should be more uniform. AL007 Bibb FuD Fullerton Miscellaneous evaluation spatial During the SDJR review, no County, gravelly notes notes spatial issues were noted. The Alabama silt loam, lines all fit the landform 6 to 15 boundaries and seem to fit the percent map unit concept. There were slopes polygons outside the major areas that will require field visits to verify map unit concept.</p>

The Project Plan is a NASIS report that presents the data entered into the NASIS Project object. For proposed projects, the following data fields in the Project table data are populated: User Project Identification Project Name Project Description MLRA Soil Survey Office Project Map units Project Land Category Breakdown Project Concern Need Milestone "Future Project" Once approved, the remaining fields are then populated. This exhibit provides a checklist of NASIS populated fields to be managed by the SSO. User Project Identification: This column identifies the priority of the project and is populated based on region guidance. An example is "2018-1," which identifies the top priority for fiscal year (FY) 2018. Project Name: The project name begins with the MLRA followed by a space, a dash, and another space, map unit or landform indicator (e.g., MLRA 133B - Cahaba fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; MLRA 128 - Great Limestone Valley Summits). Project Description The project description discusses the key issues of project map units identified during the inventory and assessment and describes specific work activities necessary to address those key issues. Time needed to complete the project, where work will occur, expected outcome, and benefits gained from completing the project are described. The project description provides mangers with appropriate information to review and approve the project while providing project staff with information sufficient to carry out the project. Section 610.16 shows examples of project descriptions. Including items in the project description that are also populated elsewhere in project object may produce redundancy in the Project Plan. For example, the Project Plan may extract project map units from the Project Map Unit table; therefore, consideration should be given to how the map units, or components are described in the project description. The project description is subdivided into two required sections. The first section is a single paragraph summary while the second section expounds specific project details. Each section describes the what, how, where, when, why, and who of the project. First Section - Summary Paragraph The first paragraph is an executive summary, or abstract, of the project. The primary audience are managers, e.g., State Conservationists, State soil scientists, and soil survey regional directors. The summary provides the managers with an overview to assist them in reviewing the project. The paragraph is limited to 1,000 characters. The paragraph is written without headers, bulleted items, or lists. See section 610.16 for examples. The summary paragraph discusses the following six items: 1. What map units (or components) are being investigated AND what are the key issues. 2. Where will the project be focused or the areas impacted by the project. Identify individual survey areas, specific landforms, geographic areas, States or sections of States, or MLRAs or sections of MLRAs. 3. How will the issues be addressed or resolved, AND what is the expected outcome: a. List field and/or office work necessary to address the issues listed in item 1, b. Summarize how the current soil survey information will change. 4. When is the project timeframe and how many staff years to complete the project? 5. Who requested the project and/or is the main beneficiary? 6. Why is the project important by identifying the major resource concern to benefit from project completion? Second Section - Project Details This section follows the executive summary (above) and begins with the major heading "Project Details." It should be as concise as possible while remaining informative enough to provide current or future soil scientists with the information necessary to continue the project. The primary target audience is the field soil scientist. Include background history only to the extent necessary to guide the project leader. The following outline will be followed; however, the list is not all inclusive and other issues can be included. A comment on the implemented update strategy is interwoven into this section (see section 610.3(C)). The project details are organized by: Objectives and Procedures,
