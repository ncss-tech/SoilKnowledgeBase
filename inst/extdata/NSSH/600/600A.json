It discusses general procedures to illustrate and explain the principles and concepts, but the National Soil Survey Handbook presents current operational procedures of NRCS in more detail.(2) Amendments may be issued to the Soil Survey Manual as NRCS directives. Proposals to amend the manual may originate from any interested individual or group participating in the NCSS or from staffs of foreign soil survey organizations.
