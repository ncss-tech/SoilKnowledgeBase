It has the combination of soil properties, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields of crops in an economic manner if it is treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. In general, prime farmland has an adequate and dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and growing season, an acceptable level of acidity or alkalinity, an acceptable content of salt or sodium, and few or no rocks. Its soils are permeable to water and air. Prime farmland is not excessively eroded or saturated with water for long periods of time, and it either does not flood frequently during the growing season or is protected from flooding. Users of the lists of prime farmland map units should recognize that soil properties are only one of several criteria that are necessary. Other considerations for prime farmland are the following: (i) Land Use.—Prime farmland is designated independently of current land use, but it cannot be areas of water or urban or built-up land as defined for the National Resource Inventories. Map units that are complexes or associations containing components of urban land or other miscellaneous areas as part of the map unit name (i.e., major components) may not be designated as prime farmland. The soil survey memorandum of understanding determines the scale of mapping, and local land use interests should be considered in designing map units. (ii) Flooding Frequency.—Some map units may include both prime farmland and land not prime farmland because of variations in flooding frequency. (iii) Irrigation.—Some map units have areas with a developed irrigation water supply that is dependable and of adequate quality while other areas do not have such a supply. In these map units, only the irrigated areas meet the prime farmland criteria. (iv) Water Table.—Most map units are drained but a few undrained areas are included. Only the drained areas meet the prime farmland criteria. (v) Wind Erodibility.—The product of I (soil erodibility) x C (climate factor) may not exceed 60 to meet prime farmland criteria.",

Examples of such crops are citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries, fruit, and vegetables. Unique farmland has all of the following specific characteristics: (i) It is used for a specific high-value food or fiber crop. (ii) It has a moisture supply that is adequate for the specific crop (the supply is from stored moisture, precipitation, or a developed irrigation system).

The separation of two distinct soil taxonomic units does not necessarily delineate two ecological sites. Likewise, some soil taxonomic units occur over broad environmental gradients and may support more than one distinctive historic climax plant community. Changes may be brought about by other influences, such as an increase or decrease in average annual precipitation. Ecological sites are correlated within MLRAs or LRUs.
