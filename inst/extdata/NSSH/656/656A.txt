Part 656 - Coastal Zone Soil Survey
Subpart A - General Information
656.0 Definition and Purpose
A. The coastal zone is the area where terrestrial land meets bays, sounds, estuaries, tidal rivers,
seas, oceans, or other water bodies. It includes dunes, marshes, beaches, and anthropogenic coastal
areas. It has shallow, subtidal subaqueous soils (submerged lands) that can support submerged
aquatic vegetation. To effectively study, manage, conserve, and sustain shallow,
subtidal ecosystems, a spatial inventory of the basic resources and habitats is essential.
B. A coastal zone soil survey (CZSS) is an order 2 soil survey with a focus in the coastal zone.
Once completed, a CZSS provides detailed (1:12,000 scale) spatial soil maps (points, lines, and
polygons), a rich database of soil chemical and physical properties, site data, and interpretations
for coastal applications. The data and interpretations are useful for marine spatial planning,
aquaculture, and coastal and nearshore restoration projects, such as sea-grass planting, oyster reef
creation, beach replenishment, and salt marsh restoration.
656.1 Boating Safety
The reader is referred to the General Manual 360-Part 420AA and 420BB-Boating Safety in
Coastal Zone Soil Survey. The purpose of those sections is to establish policy and guidance for
safe operation, training, and maintenance of boats operated by NRCS personnel. Part 420AA
provides the background, scope, responsibilities, training, equipment, inspections, and vessel
records. Part 420BB provides information about regulations, laws and checklists for float plans,
fueling, powerboat operation, trailering, and maintenance.
