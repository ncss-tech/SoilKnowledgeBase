Name The name of the conference is the North Central Regional Soil Survey Conference. The letters NCRSSC may be used as the official acronym of the conference. Article II. Purpose The purpose of the conference is to bring together North Central States representatives of the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) to discuss technical issues and to provide a means of deciding and communicating the goals of the Soil Survey Program. Through the actions of committees and conference discussions, experience is summarized and clarified for the benefit of all; new areas are explored; procedures are proposed; and ideas are exchanged and disseminated. The conference also functions as a clearinghouse for recommendations and proposals received from individual members and State conferences for transmittal to the National Cooperative Soil Survey Conference (NCSSC). It also acts on recommendations from the national conference and other regional conferences. Article III. Membership Participants of the conference are the National Cooperative Soil Survey soil scientists of Federal, State, and university organizations; local units of government; and private organizations of the North Central Region (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin). The national leader for Soil Survey Research and Laboratory of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil and Plant Science Division serves as liaison to the NCRSSC, maintains a membership list for the conference, and provides the list to the incoming chair. If the position of national leader for Soil Survey Research and Laboratory is vacant, the liaison role is filled as designated by the director of the Soil and Plant Science Division. All cooperating agencies and organizations are responsible for providing current membership information to the Soil and Plant Science Division liaison. All soil scientists or other technical specialists of any cooperating agency or organization whose participation would be helpful for particular objectives or projects of the conference, including those from the host State, may be members. Article IV. Meetings Section 1.         Time. The conference ordinarily convenes every 2 years, in even-numbered years. Time of year is determined by the conference chair. Additional meetings may be called by request of the steering committee or the conference with the administrative approval of the participating agencies and organizations. Section 2.         Host State. The host State is determined two meetings in advance (e.g., the 2006 conference selected the host State for 2010 and the 2008 conference selected the host State for 2012). During the conference, business meeting invitations from the various States are considered and voted upon. A simple majority vote decides the host State. The conference may be held at any suitable location within the host State. The State rotation for the NCRSSC is as follows: North Dakota, Kansas, Ohio, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, South Dakota, Missouri, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana. Section 3.   Separate Meetings. University agricultural experiment station representatives to the North Central Regional Committee No. 3 (NCERA-3) on soil surveys meet during the conference. Concurrently, soil scientists of the other cooperating agencies meet to discuss their issues. Section 4.   Basic Structure of Regional Conference. Although the agenda for each conference varies depending upon current issues and items of interest, the following is a basic recommended list of items that could be included in a North Central Regional Soil Survey Conference. This list can be used as an aid for States planning future conference meetings: 1.       Welcome by cooperating host State agencies. 2.       Reports by cooperating agencies such as NRCS, NCERA-3, Forest Service (FS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and others, if applicable. 3.       Reports from soil survey regional offices (SSRs) within the North Central Region. 4.       Time allotted for breakout sessions for NRCS and NCERA-3, and others as needed. 5.

A half- or full-day field trip to look at soil-related problems or landscapes of interest in the area. Article V. Steering Committee, Committee Officers, and Committee Chairs Section 1.   The conference always has a steering committee. The steering committee consists of: - NRCS State soil scientist of host State - The university representative for host State - NRCS and university representative from the next host State - Past NCRSSC chair and co-chair - National leader for Soil Survey Research and Laboratory of the Soil and Plant Science Division - Soil survey regional director for the host site - The chair of the five standing committees Officers rotate among agencies. That is, the chair must be of a different agency than the past chair. Similarly, the secretary must be of a different agency than the past secretary. At each biennial conference a secretary is elected for the succeeding conference. The secretary (whoever will be the next NCRSSC chair-either the NRCS State soil scientist or university representative) becomes chair when his/her successor is elected. When an officer is unable to complete his/her term of office, the steering committee appoints a successor. Responsibilities of the steering committee include the following: - Meet once after the business meeting of each conference and, if necessary, meet at other times. - Assist in the selection of special participants in a specific regional conference. - Assist in the formulation of charges to committees. - Compile, edit, and distribute the NCRSSC Proceedings to all conference attendees within 120 days after the conference. - Forward action items, recommendations, and resolutions to the national leader for Soil Survey Research and Laboratory of the Soil and Plant Science Division and to the director of Soil and Plant Science Division.

      "content": "602.15 Conducting NCSS Conferences Communication within and between the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) regional and national conferences is essential. If the conferences are to remain an effective means of conducting business, and all partners are to be afforded effective means to contribute, then direction is needed on how communications happen within the conferences. Steering committees and liaisons should coordinate with committee chairs to help ensure that meeting time is allocated appropriately among important conference activities, including working sessions for standing and ad hoc committees, updates, information exchange, and field trips. Meeting conference objectives requires coordination and continued feedback from the membership and from regular, ongoing work committees throughout the year. Timely execution of planning efforts for regional and national conferences is necessary to ensure participation in the preconference activity. Coordination Activities The Soil and Plant Science Division director assigns a liaison to each of the regional conferences and may be chosen from any NCSS member. The role of the liaison is to help ensure good communication between the regional and national conferences. Activities that can help accomplish this goal include: ensuring all steering committee members are familiar with the specific guidance given in the regional conference bylaws, helping the steering committee develop the agenda for the regional conference and adequately address issues of concern from the past national conference or current national committee deliberations, and helping ensure that all issues from regional conferences are identified in the conference report and that the report is presented and/or made available to participants at the next national conference. The chair of each regional standing committee should attend the next national conference to ensure that issues of concern raised in regional committee deliberations are reported to the national conference and to provide clarification and counsel to the national committee regarding those issues. This individual should also ensure that discussions of the national committee are well understood during deliberations of the regional committee during the year following the national conference. The regional steering committee, with the assistance of the assigned liaison, should ensure that the issues raised by any regional ad hoc committee are directed to all appropriate members of the national conference and that feedback is directed to the ad hoc committee so that committee members are aware of the disposition of their concern. Regional standing and adhoc committee chairs will provide a report to members of the national conference steering committee and the chair of each of the national standing committees or related national conference personnel as follows: within 30 days of the end of the regional conference, 90 days before the next national conference, and within 90 days of the next regional conference. In addition, any individual who has responsibility for a subject matter addressed as an item of concern or a recommendation should be provided a copy. The reports are presented at conference committee meetings. To meet NCSS objectives, it is critical to have continuity from one conference to the next. The Timeline of Activities facilitates continuity. Timeline of Activities Conference date                                         Activity minus 23 months     Steering committee and committee chairs provide reports, including names of the new committee chairs and vice-chairs, to the Soil and Plant Science Division for posting on the NCSS website, and to the national conference liaisons for communication to the corresponding national or regional committees.
