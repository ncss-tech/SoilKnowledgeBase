648.10 Glossary
A. accuracy.-The difference between the predicted value at a location and the measured or observed
value at the same location. For overall accuracy, this is the proportion of correctly allocated instances
to the most probable class.
B. class (soil).-Discrete representation of soil information based on a range of shared values or
attributes (i.e., environmental, spectral, SSURGO, lab, etc.)
C. continuous raster.-A type of raster used to communicate information on a topic that varies
progressively across a surface for phenomena that have no distinct borders such as temperature,
precipitation, or elevation.
D. geostatistics.-A range of statistical techniques for modeling spatial patterns as a function of
distance to adjacent observations.
E. ISODATA.-Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique; a variation on k-mean clustering
F. k-means clustering.-An iterative process that creates class clusters in data and classifies pixels
until the change of class assignment at each pixel location is small and final classes are defined
G. knowledge-based classification.-Prediction methods that use an expert\'s knowledge as rules and
data within an inference engine to predict target classes.
H. mapunit key.-Often represented in its shorthand notation, mukey, this value comes from the
NASIS legend map unit id column and relates a map unit to its legend and a component to its map
unit.
I. pixel.-The smallest unit of information represented in a raster, typically square. Alternatively
referred to as a grid cell.
J. prediction interval.-A measure which reports the range of values within which the true value is
likely to occur (e.g., a 90-percent prediction interval indicates the range in values in which a new
measurement will be found 9 times out of 10).
K. predictive modeling.-The process of developing a mathematical model that approximates the
true relationship between soil classes or properties and environmental covariates to produce and
accurate prediction (e.g., tree-based models, regression)
L. raster.-A regular grid or array of cells covering a spatial area. A raster is often viewed as
consisting of rows and columns of grid cells.
M. supervised classification.-Prediction methods that require soil observations (training data)
covering the area of interest and the target classes. Class definitions from training data are combined
with carefully selected environmental data, and the applied algorithm assigns a class to each pixel.
N. uncertainty.-For continuous data types, the prediction interval is used to communicate a range of
values within which the true value at any prediction location is expected. For example, a 90-percent
prediction interval is often used and indicates the range of values in which a new measurement is
likely to occur 9 times out of 10 (or 90 percent of the time).
For categorical data types (class data), a numerical value conveying confidence for the predicted
outcome. An increase in the number of potential outcomes indicates a higher degree of
uncertainty present within the model
O. unsupervised classification.-Exploratory methods most reliant on computer automation and the
only method that does not require soil observations (training data) covering the area of interest. The
algorithm uncovers statistical patterns inherent in the data and groups pixels with similar
characteristics into unique clusters (classes) based on statistically determined criteria.

<abstract>This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data
developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS). The data presented here depict the North Dakota state
raster template database. The information within this database are developed using digital soil mapping
methodologies and are updated annually to include work completed as Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) or initial
raster mapping projects by the NCSS. The classes in the map layer are related to attributes stored in the National
Soil Information System relational database which include information for soil properties and interpretations in the
raster class.</abstract>
<purpose>The FY2017 North Dakota Raster Soil Survey database was created for use in national, regional, and
state-wide resource planning where soils information is a component. The dataset consists of soils information in
raster and tabular format. The RaSS_ND000_2017 raster is aligned with other common layers, e.g., National Land
Cover Database (NLCD), the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Crop Data Layer, or the National
Elevation Dataset (NED).</purpose>

<procdesc>The Raster Soil Survey database of North Dakota is a comprehensive project that typically receives
annual updates from raster soil mapping projects completed as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.
These projects utilize digital soil mapping methodologies products to improve or progress the currently existing
official SSURGO (Soil Survey Geographic database) inventories with detailed, refined, and seamless soil information
by combining the existing information with other digital environmental data. These projects are often applied on a
map unit, landform, or ecological unit potentially involving soil catenas.

<procdesc>1-meter digital elevation grid files were downloaded from the North Dakota LiDAR Dissemination
Mapservice sponsored by the North Dakota Water Commission. The 1-meter digital elevation grid files were
mosaicked using ESRI ArcGIS 10.3. The mosaicked product was then projected to USA Contiguous Albers Equal
Area Conic USGS coordinate system NAD83 WKID: 102039. The mosaicked 1-meter digital elevation model was
resampled to a 5-meter resolution digital elevation model using the ESRI ArcGIS 10.1 Spatial Analyst \'Aggregate\'
function using the median aggregation technique.</procdesc>

<procdesc>In 2017 the Souris Till Plain physiographic subsection of the Northern Black Glaciated Plains
(MLRA 55A) was identified as a MLRA project area. The Souris Till Plain comprises of ground and stagnation
moraines surrounding Glacial Lake Souris and till-floored lake plains within the margins of the glacial lake. In some
process steps the project area was further stratified into two general physiographic areas: The break between the
EPA Level IV \"Glacial Lake Basins\" Subsection 46c and the largest zone of \"Northern Black Prairie - 46g\", just west
of the eastern leg of the Souris River in North Central North Dakota. These physiographic areas were used as the
extent boundary for this project.
Mapping was completed through the identification of 290 Training Points. Training points were used to support
digital mapping and included pedon data collected in landform traverses and ancillary data from SSURGO
delineations and National Wetland Inventory Data. Field documentation was stratified by geographic area and
summarized by hillslope position. Resulting documentation related to diagnostic soil features, soil classification
(series) and hillslope position were modeled into continuous rasters (grids) using previously identified covariates
from LIDAR across an area beyond the project extent. A combination of digital mapping techniques including
knowledge-based, regression and tree-based models were employed for preliminary products. Traditional
classification and correlation methods were used with a post-modeling evaluation to arrive at a provisional 10 class
raster at 5m resolution, which excluded most of the anthropogenic features found in the scene. Provisional raster
was foundational for analysis in updating SSURGO.
Depending on the variable being modeled, spatial modeling was applied to either the entire project extent or to a
specific physiographic region. For specifics on the digital mapping strategies applied, conditional rules establised
and classification results refer to the Classification and Correlation of the Soil Survey of Northern Black Glaciated
Plains, Souris Till Plain (SS55A_1) document.
A field based stratified random/clustered validation was initiated for the raster soil survey area. A modification of a
stratified random sampling scheme was applied. The initial stratification was based upon targeting unique class
instances across 9 geographic zones covering the 1.1 million acre project extent.
To finalize continous data across the soil survey and project area, small voids in the raster product were assigned
the dominant value from the surrounding areas. In larger voids where anthropogenic areas were masked
(&gt;120m wide and/or 5.7 acres in size including some highways, farmsteads, towns and some recently developed
suburban areas of Minot, ND) the existing SSURGO map units were applied as the raster map units. More densely
populated areas of cities and larger airports and highways carry map units with a major component of Urban Land
and are excluded outright from this project area. The final extent of the raster soil survey area was limited to the
following MLRA map units in SSURGO which were the primary scope of the project:
Hamlet-Tonka-Wyard complex, 0 to 3 percent slopes (2wfh1);
Hamlet-Tonka-Hamerly complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes(2vyjz);
Hamlet-Balaton loams, 0 to 2 percent slopes (2vyjs);
Hamlet-Souris-Balaton loams, 1 to 5 percent slopes(2vyjt);
Hamlet-Souris-Tonka complex, 0 to 3 percent slopes(2vyjx);
Hamlet-Souris-Tonka complex, 0 to 5 percent slopes(2vyjy);
Hamlet-Souris loams, 1 to 3 percent slopes(2vyjq);
Hamlet-Souris loams, 1 to 5 percent slopes(2vyjr).
Classification of the aggregated component data and pedon data is completed to the lowest level of Soil Taxonomy
using the 12th Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy. All pedons used to support the development of raster component
data were accurately reflected in the raster soil map units. The project area of interest included 390 NASIS
pedons, of which 264 were chosen to represent the component and map unit data for the raster. Approximately
80-90% of the observed variability in the soil properties, qualities and ratings from selected pedon data was
captured in the aggregated component data.
As correlations were approved, the data was resampled to 10m. The resampling used the gSSURGO national grid as
a snap raster. An additional pass of validation points were applied to finalize an accuracy assessment against the
10m resample raster. Results of the validation were published targeting 95% confidence (map accuracy).
This dataset consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The National Soil
Information System (NASIS) database was developed by NRCS soil scientists according to national standards. The
raster soil map units are linked to attributes in NASIS. An area-wide file geodatabase (ESRI) was created using
ArcGIS 10.1 software to accommodate the spatial and tabular raster soil survey data. Relationship classes between
tables were created in the geodatabase.
Attribution is confirmed by display of the map data using geospatial and tabular software, in review selected
attributes and spatial relationships. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the correlation document.
A field based validation was also initiated through the project to establish spatial and attribute accuracy. Through
the validation, the seven map unit classes below were evaluated: Digitally Modeled Classes
