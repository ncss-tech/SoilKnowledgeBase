Definition.—Soil survey information is the analysis and summary of records gathered either during the initial inventory or added later to enhance the data assembled during the initial investigation and mapping. Soil survey information is distributed in a variety of forms and always includes a geographic component identifying either the spatial or point location of the information. Soil survey information describes, defines, and classifies the soils and interprets them for various uses. It documents the kinds, extent, location, and quality of the soils in the survey area. It contains soil interpretations appropriate for the intended uses of the soils. The memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area describes these uses.",

The Web Soil Survey allows the user to interactively select an area of interest on the map, to view and print the soils map for the area-of-interest, to access soil data for the area, and to obtain information on the suitability of the soils for selected uses. The Web Soil Survey is a dynamic system; any corrections and enhancements made to the spatial and tabular data as a result of soil survey maintenance can be uploaded to the intermediate databases which provide informational services to the Web Soil Survey. Although the information in the current version is detailed soil survey information, plans are to include general soil information and point data. The tabular data, spatial data, template database, and FGDC metadata for the U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2) are available for download from the Web Soil Survey.",
