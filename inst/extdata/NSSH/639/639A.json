Other types of areas are also recorded. The “Area Type” object includes the “Area Type,” “Area,” and “Area Text” tables. (i) The “Area Type” table lists the types of areas and the owners of each area. In NASIS, different kinds of areas are organized by area type. For example, traditional soil survey areas are listed in the “Area” table under the “Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area” type. Users may create their own area types. (ii) A record in the “Area Type” table is created as necessary and retained as part of the historical records for a soil survey area. (iii) Records recorded in the “Area Type” and “Area” tables serve as lookup tables for other data elements in NASIS. (iv) Nationally coordinated area type objects owned by NSSC Pangaea must not be duplicated. (v) The “Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area” and “MLRA Soil Survey Area” are the official area types for soil survey areas. Record maintenance for these official area types is the responsibility of the National Soil Survey Center. (vi) The “area symbol” is a unique label within a particular area type that is used to identify the soil survey area. Typically, symbols for political areas such as States and counties use Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes (e.g., Lancaster County, Nebraska = NE109). A survey area and a county may have the same area symbol because each is recorded under a different area type. (vii) The “area name” is the name given to the specific area. Although a soil survey area may be named for a county, the soil survey area name is recorded under the “soil survey area” area type and the county name is recorded under the “county” area type, even if the names are the same. (viii) The “area acres” are the total acreage of all land and water areas in a specified geographic area as identified by the 1992 National Resources Inventory (NRI) data. For example, the total acreage of a multicounty soil survey area is recorded in this table, as well as the total acreage for each of the counties. Parts of the soil survey area that occur in each county are recorded in the “Legend Area Overlap” table. Acreages are not recorded for some area types.",

These records are used to create the map unit identification legend, conversion legends, and correlation status reports for the survey area. The “Legend” object is created at the beginning of the survey, maintained throughout the course of the survey, and retained as part of the historical records. The “Legend” object includes several tables including the main “Legend” table. Generally, the legend in an initial survey is the responsibility of the soil survey office during the course of the initial soil survey. Responsibility is transferred to the SSR at completion of the survey. (i) In the “Legend” table, some columns are available for viewing but are restricted for editing. For example, the “survey status” column (which identifies the archived entries as belonging to nonproject, initial, published, update needed, update, out-of-date, or extensive revision surveys) and “correlation date” column (which records the historical correlation date for the survey) cannot be edited. Other data columns are not restricted for editing and allow any appropriate entry (e.g., “Legend Text”). (ii) In the “Legend Mapunit” a link is recorded between the “Legend” table and individual map unit records in the “Mapunit” table. The “Legend Mapunit” table identifies the publication map unit symbol, map unit status, and map unit acres for map units in the given survey area. The publication map unit symbol is assigned by the State soil scientist. (iii) The combination of map unit symbols and their status in the survey area legend are unique. (iv) The “Legend Area Overlap” table is required to contain at least the appropriate valid “State or Territory” area type overlap record, the appropriate “MLRA” area type, and the valid “County or Parish” area type overlap record within the legend survey area. (v) Each “County or Parish” area type listed in the “Legend Area Overlap” table has its corresponding “State or Territory” area type overlap. (vi) Project scale in the “Legend” table must be populated. (vii) Each map unit within the “Legend Mapunit” table has a unique publication symbol, name, and status combination (see part 627, section 627.5, of this handbook for guidance). The map unit name is maintained in the “Mapunit” object, defined below. (viii) Once created, map unit records are never deleted. During the correlation process, the status of map units migrates from “provisional” to “approved” to “correlated.” If a map unit is correlated to a new symbol, its status is changed to “additional.”",

The “Mapunit” object maintains the map unit name, its national map unit symbol, and the link to its associated data mapunits. It documents a continuous record of map unit development and correlation decisions made for the map unit, independent of the legend to which it is linked. These records are used to create the map unit identification legend, conversion legends, and correlation status reports for the survey area where the map unit is linked. A map unit is related to a geographic area when linked to a soil survey area legend by the “Legend Mapunit” table. The Mapunit object includes several tables, including the “Mapunit,” “Correlation,” “Mapunit History,” and “Mapunit Text” tables. (i) The “Mapunit” table lists mapunit name, kind, national mapunit symbol, and linear and point feature characteristics. This information is relative to the specific map unit and must be considered when the map unit is linked to multiple legends. (ii) The “Correlation” table records all instances of data mapunits used to support correlation of the map unit. The “Mapunit History” table is populated when a new map unit is created and populated at each correlation event that affects the map unit. (iii) The “National Mapunit Symbol” is a computer-assigned conversion of the internal map unit record identification number to a base-31 alphanumeric character. This field is generated as new rows are created in the “Mapunit” table, and it is protected from editing. It was designed to facilitate the concept of soil survey update on an MLRA basis by providing a unique symbol to a map unit regardless of the soil survey areas to which the map unit is linked. (iv) Responsibility and ownership of a specific map unit is indicated by the “Mapunit NASIS Site” and “NASIS Group” columns in the “Mapunit” table. Map unit management in an ongoing survey or update project is the responsibility of the soil survey office.",

      "content": "(3) “Data Mapunit” Object.—This business object is a record or a collection of records identifying percentage of its components (i.e., composition), physical and chemical properties, morphological attributes, interpretations, and performance for a map unit. A “Data Mapunit” object is a set of data records and as such is not related to any geographic area or map unit delineation unless linked to a specific map unit. These records are used to document map unit concept characteristics and create reports of soil properties and interpretations. “Data Mapunit” objects are created as needed and retained as part of the historical records. The “Data Mapunit” object includes the parent “Data Mapunit” table and many other tables. The underlying “Component” and “Horizon” tables are child tables of the “Data Mapunit” table. The “Component” and “Horizon” tables each have many underlying child tables. (i) “Data Mapunit” Table.—The “Data Mapunit” table lists data mapunits by using the “DMU Description” field as well as the “DMU NASIS Site,” and “NASIS Group” fields to identify ownership. It also contains information such as the order of survey for which the data mapunit was developed and State-specific soil potential and interpretive class ratings. (ii) “Component” Table.—The “Component” table lists the named soils, miscellaneous areas, or both for each map unit. Soils and miscellaneous areas populated in the “Component” table are the components identified in the map unit name along with those components that are strongly contrasting to the named components. Components are designated as either “major” or “minor” components depending on their percentage in the composition of the map unit. This table provides information pertinent to the component as a whole (e.g., slope, drainage class, taxonomic classification, etc.). (iii) Important Guidance on Populating Component Data  If the component percentage is greater than zero (e.g., Low=65, RV=75, High=90) for a component, that component exists in every delineation of that map unit. If the component percentage includes zero (e.g., Low=0, RV=50, High=90), the component may exist in some delineations but not in others.  Total representative component percentage should equal 100 percent; it cannot exceed 100 percent.  The component name field must be populated using sentence case with a series name or an appropriate higher taxon name (e.g., Udorthents). Phase criteria, commas, spaces, or extraneous soil criteria information is not allowed in the component name field. Extra information is recorded in the “Local Phase” column.  The entry in the “Taxon Kind” column must agree with the component name. For example, if the name “Rock Outcrop,” is used then “miscellaneous area” must be selected as the taxon kind.  If the component kind is designated as a miscellaneous area, then the component name must exactly match one of the approved types that are defined in part 627 of this handbook.  Major components must be designated as such. Major components are generally those that are identified in the map unit name.  The “Hydric Rating” column must be populated for each component.  Pedons used to support development of the component must be identified with a record (i.e., row) in the “Component Pedon” table. This record links the “Data Mapunit” and “Pedon” objects. Only one pedon record is assigned as the “representative” pedon.  If a soil floods, or ponds, or contains moisture, then all 12 months are populated in the “Component Month” table and the months in which the annual event most commonly occurs are populated. Remaining months are left NULL.  In the “Component Crop Yield” table, only one unit of measure (UOM) is assigned for the unique crop name (e.g., a data entry showing two records of alfalfa, one with tons and one with AUM, is incorrect).  All root-limiting layers must be populated in the “Component Restriction” table. Depth to the restrictive layer matches the depth to the corresponding horizon in the “Component Horizon” table. (iv) “Horizon” Table.—The “Horizon” table presents the various horizons that have been aggregated from the genetic soil horizons described in the various documented pedons. These horizon data are aggregated for ease in generating interpretations and presenting soil survey information to users. Each horizon recorded in this table identifies the range of properties and interpretations for the given horizon. The horizons and their range of properties are aggregated from the observed population of point descriptions collected for the given component within the given map unit. Horizon properties are assigned three values: Low (L), Representative (RV), and High (H). (v) Important Guidance on Populating Horizon Data  Refer to part 618 of this handbook for detailed information on soil properties.  If the horizon thickness is greater than zero (e.g., Low=5, RV=8, High=12), the horizon exists everywhere this component occurs in this map unit. If the horizon thickness includes zero (e.g., Low=0, RV=1, High=3), the horizon may exist in some places where this component occurs but may not exist in other places.  “Top (Low, RV, High)” is the distance from the top of the soil to the upper boundary of the soil horizon. “Bottom Depth (Low, RV, High)” is the distance from the top of the soil to the lower boundary of the soil horizon.  No gaps or overlaps are allowed in horizon depths. Depths must join exactly between adjacent horizons.  “Master” is one of three kinds of symbols that, when concatenated, are used to distinguish different kinds of layers in soils. Master horizons and layers are the base symbols to which other characters are added to complete the designations. Capital letters, carets (^), and virgules (/) are the symbols used to choose the “Master” designation. The word “and” is also part of the designation of some combination horizons (e.g., E and B).  Master horizons “O” and “R” must have the “Master” and “Designation” columns properly populated.  Combination horizons, such as “E/Bt” or “E and Bt,” are recorded twice: once for the characteristics of the first part and again on another row for the characteristics of the second part. The RV depths for each characteristic horizon should reflect the best estimate of depths for the recorded part. The RV values assigned for horizon top and bottom depths must be continuous (e.g., 20 to 35 cm for one record and 35 to 50 cm for the other record) and should not be duplicated or overlapping. The range of depths should be populated in the “Low” and “High” columns to identify the overlapping nature of the horizon.  “Designation” is the concatenation of five kinds of symbols that are separate data elements in NASIS and must be populated individually. These symbols are discontinuities (“Disc”), master horizons and layers (“Master”), prime symbols (“Prime”), suffix symbols (“Suffix”), and vertical subdivisions (“Sub”). These symbols are used in various combinations to designate layers within the soil. The full horizon designation, such as “Btk2” or “2^Cg1,” is shown in the “Designation” column. Default designations were set as generic “H” horizons, such as H1, H2, etc., during conversion from a prior database into NASIS. These generic designations may continue to be used. The “Designation” column may be calculated, based on data in other columns. The status indicator in the rightmost part of the “Designation” column indicates whether a value in this column has been manually entered (M), calculated (C), or neither (a null entry in the status block).  All “Low,” “Representative,” and “High” value fields are populated for soil properties.  Tenth-bar, third-bar, and 15-bar water contents are populated with values less than 100.  Populate CEC-7 if pH is greater than or equal to 5.5; otherwise populate ECEC.  Only one “Representative” texture is assigned for each horizon in the “Horizon Texture Group” table.  Avoid the use of stratified textures (e.g., SR-S-L) if possible by separating and populating horizons based on different soil properties.  Horizon structure must be populated.  Populate all fields in the “Horizon Fragments” table for soils with fragments.  The sum of the values in the “Vol % RV” column of the Horizon Fragments table should match the value in the “Total Fragment Volume RV” column in the “Horizon” table.  The sum of fragment volumes must agree with the texture modifier chosen for the RV texture modifier and class in the “Horizon Texture Group” table.",
