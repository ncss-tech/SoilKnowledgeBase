Specific fonts (arial and times new roman) are used for soil labels, place names, culture and hydrographic feature names, margin information, etc. (ii) Style Sheet (NRCS SSURGO.style) To maintain consistency for map elements across map sheets undergoing digital map finishing, a style sheet is used.

Streams less than 0.5 inch in length are not shown except where connected to map neat lines that extend onto the adjacent map. Hydrographic Features: -    Streams.-Label stream names. Place double line stream names between shores where overprinting will not occur. Place type for linear features on the upper side aligned with the general direction of the feature. Place names on the same side and align to fit the feature. Some features may require more than one label or different sized labels. Place word components in uncluttered areas wherever possible. - Other Hydrographic Features.-Label other hydrographic features, if needed; for example, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs.",

      "content": "(5) Annotation.-Annotation includes soil labels and the proper names of cultural, hydrographic, and hypsographic features. The USGS digital raster graphics files (DRGs) are used for guidance in determining the names and locations of all annotation, excluding the placement of soil labels. Position annotation to read from left to right or from bottom to top (except where a feature is at an angle of more than 90 degrees, causing annotation to appear upside down). Align with the general shape of the feature it represents, unless specified to be placed horizontally. Where letter spacing is preferred for effective presentation of feature names, space the letters proportionately across the feature area. Avoid placing annotation over other features wherever possible. (i) Public Land Survey System (PLSS).-Label township and range identifications along the soil survey area boundary or outside the map neat line. Identify all land division sections within the interior of all maps. Adjust the section numbers to avoid overprinting other map elements. (ii) Boundary Identifications - Soil Survey Boundaries.-Identify all national, State, county or parish, and limit-of- soil-survey boundaries, and place the labels parallel to the boundary line. The soil survey area boundary options are county or parish boundary, State or national boundary, and limit of soil survey. - Identify limit-of-soil-survey boundaries only when they do not correspond with national, State, or county or parish boundaries. Label them \\\"LIMIT OF SOIL SURVEY.\\\" - If the proper name of a reservation, forest, or national or State park does not appear in the interior of the map, identify the boundary with its proper name, such as \\\"ROSEBUD INDIAN RESERVATION.\\\" - For surveys that coincide with counties, parishes, or MLRAs, label names of adjacent counties and parishes along the outside edge of the soil survey boundary parallel to the boundary. Where the survey joins another State, label the adjacent State name along with the adjacent county and parish names. - Where the survey adjoins another nation, label the national name and its provincial name along the national boundary. - For survey areas that contain more than one county or parish or portions of counties or parishes and have county or parish (or State) boundaries within a survey area, label counties, parishes, and States as they occur on each side of the State boundaries. Label more than once where boundaries are meandering or difficult to follow. - Political and Administrative Boundaries.-Label text for national or State parks, forests, and reservations parallel to the boundary line symbol. (iii) Transportation - Road Emblems.-Identify interstate, Federal, State, and other roads by placing route emblems as needed on the map. Place emblems horizontally. Place the emblem directly on the feature. Where roads continue on adjoining maps, place the emblems close to the map neat line. Identify county highways and other roads as needed. - Railroads.-Place the name directly on the feature. Abbreviate the names as needed. (iv) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) - Populated Places.-Label cities, towns, and other populated areas horizontally. Annotation sizes should be used to distinguish priorities. (v) GNIS - Nonpopulated Places - Airports and Schools.-Label airports and schools horizontally. - Churches and Cemeteries.-Label churches and cemeteries horizontally. (vi) Hypsographic Features.-These include mountain ranges, ridges, peaks, knobs, buttes, hills, canyons, bluffs, plateaus, sinks, summits, gaps, mesas, plains, prairies, passes, reefs, valleys, hollows, meadows, gulches, deserts, washes, faults, escarpments, islands, peninsulas, arroyos, capes, points, landings, beaches, and basins.",
