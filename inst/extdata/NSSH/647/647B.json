      "content": "647.15 Glossary Ad hoc features Ad hoc features are special surface soil features that are too small to delineate at the mapping scale but are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. Ad hoc features are not mapped when the feature they represent is a common component in the map unit. Features that are common components in the map unit should be named, described, and located on the landscape in the map unit description. When mapped, ad hoc features are represented as points or lines. Annotation Information or markings on a map for clarification, such as numbers, letters, symbols, and signs. Approved symbols Soil survey, cultural, and hydrographic features that have been approved and certified during progressive or final correlation. Attribute A characteristic of a geographic feature. Attribute data are linked or related to a feature by an identifier. For example, a soil symbol is linked to an attribute that describes the percentage of slope for the map unit area. Base map A map showing background reference information (landforms, roads, boundaries, etc.). Other data themes can be placed on top of the base map. Coinciding features Any features that occupy the same place in space. Compilation The production of a new map from existing maps, aerial photographs, surveys, new data, and other sources. The new map is generally a geodetically controlled map. Compilation bases Base maps, to which previously collected data is transferred, used for map finishing or digitizing. They are generally digital orthoimagery or rectified photographs. Conventional features Natural or manmade objects or situations that are represented graphically with standard symbols that are adopted by Federal mapping agencies. These features are referred to as cultural and hydrographic features. Coordinate pair A set of Cartesian coordinates describing the two-dimensional location of a point, line, or polygon feature in relation to the common coordinate system of the database. Cultural features Any feature created or modified by humans. Digital Of or relating to data in the form of numerical digits in binary form.

Nominal scale The actual scale (with no rectification) at which photography is flown. Planimetric map A large-scale map in which all features are projected perpendicularly onto a horizontal datum plane so that horizontal distances can be measured on the map with accuracy. Public Land Survey System (PLSS) A method used in the United States to locate and identify land, particularly for titles and deeds of farm or rural land. Its basic units of area are the township and section. Point A single x, y coordinate for a geographic feature too small to be represented as an area or line. Polygon A closed area that is described by a string of coordinates that represent the boundary of the area. The beginning and ending points are the same. A series of attributes are usually assigned to the set of boundary coordinates that make up the unit. Publication index A map developed using a county highway map as a base which depicts the layout of a soil survey’s map sheets; an index to map sheets for publication. It generally includes the publication sheet numbers that are referenced with topographic quadrangles and longitude and latitude graticules. Raster A regular grid or array of cells covering a spatial area. A raster is often viewed as consisting of rows and columns of grid cells. Raster scanning See Scanning.

The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. Purpose: SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Supplemental_Information: Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be available from the primary organization listed in the Point of Contact.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. This is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

This soil survey depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Data_Quality_Information: Attribute_Accuracy: Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s). Logical_Consistency_Report: Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch. ____________(20a)______________. Completeness_Report: A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same in terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and is uniquely identified. Each individual area is a delineation. Each map unit consists of one or more components. Soil scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous (nonsoil) areas that have properties and behavior significantly different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map. Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map units, and location of special soil features. These standards are outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993, USDA, SCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, Soil Survey Staff, 1999, USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Soil Survey Staff,; National Soil Survey Handbook, title 430-VI. The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit delineations were based on data collected by scientists during the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes, associations, and undifferentiated groups. Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In a consociation, delineated areas are dominated by a single soil taxon and similar soils. At least one half of the pedons in each delineation are of the same soil component so similar to the named soil that major interpretations are not affected significantly. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting. Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations are named for two or more dissimilar components with the dominant component listed first. They occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The major components of a complex cannot be mapped separately at a scale of about 1:24,000. The major components of an association can be separated at a scale of about 1:24,000. In each delineation of either a complex or an association, each major component is normally present, though their proportions may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent. Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two or more components that do not always occur together in the same delineation, but are included in the same named map unit because use and management are the same or similar for common uses. Every delineation has at least one of the major components and some may have all of them. The same principles regarding proportion of inclusions apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations. Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend, one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per 4,000 acres. A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of about ___(21)___ acres. Positional_Accuracy: Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards. The difference in positional accuracy between the soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units. For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed delineation map unit. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The map unit key is used to link to information in the National Soil Information System tables. Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil Information System database. This attribute database gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation, agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil. The National Soil Information System database contains static metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these database objects. Attributes include table and column descriptions and detailed domain information. The National Soil Information System database also contains a distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed data. Special features are described in the feature table. It includes a feature label, feature name, and feature description for each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area. Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation:",
