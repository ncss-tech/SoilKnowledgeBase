These agreements include memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and reimbursable agreements. NRCS or any public agency may initiate working agreements relating to soil survey and ecological site activities. If another Federal agency initiates a working agreement, the name of the document and the format may be different from those used by NRCS. Cooperators operate within their own sphere of authority. Title 120, General Manual, Part 401, provides policy guidelines on agreements. An MOU is not a contract, and the plans and specifications agreed upon and contained therein are not legally binding for the agencies that sign it. The MOU may provide for other working agreements, such as cooperative agreements or interagency agreements, for transfer of funds, services, space, or equipment.",
