Dedicated Project Staff: List Dedicated Staff and Title
Note: This can include both NRCS-SPSD and cooperator staff that are dedicated to assisting in
the completion of the proposed project when the Statement of Commitment is signed. Do not
include any additional resources needed. Additional resources should be included in internal
project details.
Soil Resource Inventory Methodology: List the method(s) that will be used to develop the
deliverables.
Desired Outcome: List the deliverables (do not include scale, order, resolution).
Example - Initial Soil Survey Mapping, MLRA Soil Survey Update, Ecological Site
Development, Raster Soil Survey, Interpretation Review, and etc.
Project Milestones and Scheduled Dates: Identify the tasks and their scheduled start and
completion dates to outline specifics of an expected project timeline. This includes the field
campaign, technical or progress reviews, quality control, quality assurance, and certification.
NASIS Pangaea Queries for project templates may provide general assistance with identifying
common milestones for specific field projects. Pare down to the most relevant milestones to
cooperator. If needed, contact delegated liaison for assistance in completing this portion of the
Statement of Commitment.
2.      STATEMENT OF COMMITMENT
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) will:
A. Provide staff to conduct work for the duration of the project.
B. Coordinate with cooperator to design special and ecological investigations, as
applicable, including but not limited to:
o      Dynamic Soil Properties
o      Soil Hydrology
o      Ecological Site Development
o      Dynamic Soil Survey
C. Draft an appropriate safety plan in coordination with cooperating agency to comply
with regulations of both agencies named within the Statement of Commitment. Safety
training will be a cooperative effort provisioned by and the responsibility of NRCS
and partner agency in accordance with OSHA regulations.
D. Collect field documentation according to the standards of the National Cooperative
Soil Survey (NCSS) found in approved reference publications such as the Soil Survey
Manual (SSM; 2017) and National Soil Survey Handbook (NSSH).
E. Where needed or requested, furnish detailed sampling plans (locations or zones) to
cooperating agency contacts with at least/at minimum two weeks\' advance notice to
facilitate clearance and cooperative work.
F. Conduct operations with care to minimize landscape impact and comply with laws
and regulations applicable to the project area.
G. Provide technical review of special interpretive criteria as requested by Cooperating
Agency. The criteria must be designed to use existing soil database elements within
the structure of the National Soils Information System database (NASIS) and must be
delivered through Web Soil Survey (WSS) for correlated map units that have
undergone quality control and quality assurance following NSSH standards.
H. Provide quality control and quality assurance of the data collected and posted to Web
Soil Survey and other publications means.
I. Periodically (no more than bi-annually in frequency) make available certified soil
mapping when complete throughout the term of the project. Where adequate quality
control (QC), quality assurance (QA) and data certification has been completed,
correlated soil information will be delivered annually through the refresh of official
data as part of agency mission to make available data to facilitate practical use.
J. Provide sufficient technology, hardware, software and digital data to produce spatial
and tabular databases meeting standards defined in the SSM (2017) and NSSH.
Provide field equipment, supplies, vehicles for transportation, and office space for
staff assigned to this project.
K. Develop timelines and workload analyses to be maintained and updated annually and
attached to progress reviews and/or reports. Report all progress promptly and keep
progress records and maps current. Invite personnel from cooperating agency to all
progress and final field review. Progress field reviews and final field reviews will be
conducted and reported to cooperating agency prior to any final publication.
L. Provide annual review of all information specified in this document and amend
annual progress report with adjusted timelines, as needed, to inform cooperating
agency points-of-contact.
M. Provide training opportunities (including OJT) in Soil Survey and Ecological Site
Inventory.
The (Name of Cooperating Agency) will:
A. Make accessible any existing remote sensing data, special studies, research reports,
range production data, habitat type data, cover data, pedon descriptions, or other
inventory data to enhance and accelerate the soil survey mapping process. Collaborate
with NRCS personnel and other cooperators on technology transfer.
B. Furnish background environmental knowledge and provide technical interdisciplinary
support in the field and in consultation. This includes, but is not limited to, assistance
with inventory, data collection and technical content to support the development of
Ecological Site Descriptions (ESDs). Where available, provide seasonal staff or
agency staff to assist with field work.
C. Provide technical interdisciplinary support and documentation for any specialized
interpretations. Specialized interpretative requests involving ratings, properties, or
interpretations must be provided to NRCS.
D. Arrange for cultural, biological or facilities clearance as necessary to implement
furnished NRCS sampling plans. Return clearance of furnished sampling plans with
adequate planning time for field sampling to be completed.
E. Provide NRCS staff safety training as part of a cooperative effort deemed necessary
for completion of project as outlined.
F. Provide assistance with logistics as well as use of lodging or camping facilities on-
site, if available, for ecologists and soil scientists during the field mapping portion of
the soil survey. This includes assistance with radio communication where deemed
necessary, and keys or gate combinations to access areas normally off limits to the
public.
G. Provide assistance with access, including trails, roads, locked gates, etc. Where
available, provide pack animals and guides, or allow Soil Survey staff to travel on
already planned pack trips.
H. Provide information regarding laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdiction or
project area.
I. Alert NRCS staff of any existing or potential logging projects taking place, and of
any road closures due to washouts, etc.
