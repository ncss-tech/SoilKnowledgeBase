608.12 Goal and Progress Guidelines
This exhibit provides additional guidance for administering data in NASIS related to goals and
progress reporting. It is primarily intended for Soil Survey Program managers and data stewards. It is
divided into four major Soil Survey Program business areas for ease of reference. Data elements
relevant to the business areas are listed and discussed. Also refer to section 608.13 for a quick-
reference companion that provides a snapshot of business area responsibilities for NRCS offices. The
four business areas are: (1) project administration and acreage management; (2) mapping goals and
progress; (3) imagery, orthophotography, map compilation materials, and other data layers; and (4)
initial and update survey operations. Definitions of data elements are in NASIS and therefore are not
provided in this document. Additional explanations are provided for some data elements.
I. Project Administration and Acreage Management
Timely administration of projects and acreage accountability are critical functions in assuring the
usefulness of the NASIS database as a management tool. Projects serve as \"place holders\" to plan
future needs, identify progress, and track milestone events leading to completion of soil survey
products.
Guiding Principles:
1. The tables and data elements related to goals and progress are imbedded in the NASIS
database, which is a multiuser database. They serve as the official reporting instrument for
production soil survey activities of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.
2. Administration is the responsibility of State offices; updating maps and data is the
responsibility of data stewards of the soil survey business area.
3. For the initial soil survey, data are maintained in projects linked to the \"Non-MLRA Soil
Survey Areas\" owned by the NASIS site \"NSSC Pangaea.\"
- Each \"Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area\" is linked to a project in NASIS. All geographic
areas of the Nation are covered in at least one such survey area.
- With the data conversion to NASIS 6.0, a project was created for each legend linked to a
non-MLRA soil survey area. The resulting project was named for the survey area and the
status shown in the \"Legend\" table (e.g., Allen County, Kansas - Update needed). Data
from the \"Legend Data\" object related to goals and progress in NASIS 5.4 were moved to
this new project and related tables. Acreage data in the various tables for these specific,
completed projects are not to be edited.
- Mapping progress and milestones may be reported continuously but, as a minimum, are
reported at the end of each quarter. Other data entries may be maintained continuously
but, as a minimum, are current at the end of each month.
4. For update soil survey work, a project is created for each project plan developed for the \"MLRA
Soil Survey Office Area.\"
- Projects are linked to the appropriate \"MLRA Soil Survey Office Area\" in NASIS.
- Mapping progress and milestones may be reported continuously but, as a minimum, are
reported at the end of each quarter. Other data entries may be maintained continuously
but, as a minimum, are current at the end of each month.

B. Acreage Management Protocols for Initial Soil Survey Projects Linked to Non-MLRA Soil Survey
Areas
Seven land categories are used to identify the ownership of all lands of the United States and its trust
territories. The land categories are: Native American land, other non-Federal land, Bureau of Land
Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, other Federal land, and census water.
Accordingly, acreage is assigned in each project linked in NASIS to a \"Non-MLRA Soil Survey
Area,\" subject to the following conventions:
1. Land categories reflect the current land ownership in the survey area.
2. The sum of all land category acres from all projects linked to \"Non-MLRA Soil Survey Areas\"
in a State equals the 1992 NRI acres for the State.
3. Land category acres are balanced across projects that cover the same geographic area so that
each acre is recorded only once.
4. Survey areas that cover parts of two or more States will have a separate project for each State.
Each project will have land categories, land category acres, goals, and progress for the
respective State. A \"Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area\" will be needed for each State involved.
The area symbol will be assigned for the respective State. The area name will be the same for
both. Area acres will be for the whole survey area and will be recorded as the same in each
State.
5. Acres are recorded to the actual acre or rounded to 100 acres.
6. Areas in Alaska identified as Alaska Native Lands or in Hawaii as Hawaiian Homelands are
included in the meaning of Native American land.
7. Census water applies to all contiguous water polygons that are 40 acres in size or larger. If a
water polygon is less than 40 acres in size in the survey area but extends into an adjoining
survey area such that the total extent in both survey areas is more than 40 acres, then the water
qualifies as census water. Census water acreage is not to be part of mapping goals; it is
administratively managed in NASIS as a land category in the \"Project Land Category
Breakdown\" table to account for total survey acres and progress.
Project Scenarios and Protocols:
1. Survey Areas With One Project. Only one project is linked to a \"Non-MLRA Soil Survey
Area\" in NASIS and no other survey areas have been established that coincide geographically
with any part of the survey area. The actual (or best estimate of) land category acres are
recorded in the \"Project Land Category Breakdown\" table. The sum of all acres recorded in the
table are to equal the survey area acreage.
2. Survey Areas With Two or More Projects. These areas typically have an older out-of-date
legend and corresponding project and a newer update or published legend and project. Acres in
the \"Project Land Category Breakdown\" table should be rebalanced so that the older project
shows zero acres in each land category. The newer project should reflect the actual (or best
estimate of) land category acres in the \"Project Land Category Breakdown\" table. Thus, land
category acres will be recorded only once for the survey area. Mapping progress should be
retained in both the older and newer projects as appropriate (see the section on mapping goals
and progress).
3. Survey Areas That Partly Coincide With Another Survey Area. These areas typically consist of
a newer survey area that covers part of an older survey area or a newer survey that covers all or
parts of two or more previous survey areas. Acres in the \"Project Land Category Breakdown\"
table should be rebalanced in all affected survey area projects so that current land category
acres are recorded in the newest project and subtracted from older projects. The sum of land
category acres in the newest project will equal the survey area acreage. The resulting sum of
land category acres in each of the other affected projects will total less than their respective
survey area acreage. Mapping progress should be retained in both older and newer projects as
appropriate (see the section on mapping goals and progress).
C. Acreage Management Protocols for Update Soil Survey Projects Linked to MLRA Soil Survey Areas
Seven land categories are used to identify the ownership of all lands of the United States and its trust
territories. The land categories are: Native American land, other non-Federal land, Bureau of Land
Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, other Federal land, and census water.
Accordingly, acreage is assigned in each project linked to a \"Non-MLRA Soil Survey Area,\" subject
to the following conventions:
1. Land categories reflect the current land ownership in the survey area.
2. For each such project developed, the appropriate land categories and acres will be entered into
the \"Project Land Category Breakdown\" table.
3. As these projects stand on their own and the same acre of land may be covered by more than
one project, there is no need to balance land category acres across projects or within a State.
The same acre may be reported as being updated more than once.
4. Acres are recorded to the actual acre or rounded to 100 acres.
5. Areas in Alaska identified as Alaska Native Lands or in Hawaii as Hawaiian Homelands are
included in the meaning of Native American land.
6. Census water applies to all contiguous water polygons that are 40 acres in size or larger. If a
water polygon is less than 40 acres in size in the survey area but extends into an adjoining
survey area such that the total extent in both survey areas is more than 40 acres, then the water
qualifies as census water. Census water acreage is not to be part of mapping goals; it is
administratively managed in NASIS as a land category in the \"Project Land Category
Breakdown\" table so that total survey acres and progress are accounted for.
II. Mapping Goals and Progress
Goals and progress are recorded in the \"Project Mapping Goal\" and \"Project Mapping Progress\" tables
for each defined project. Goals and progress may be recorded for each individual project staff member
or for the project staff as a whole. Use the following protocols:
1. Project Staff. First, enter individual project member names in the \"Project Staff\" table before
entering goals or progress. A choice list is provided based on user names in the NASIS
\"User\" table. If a name needs to be added to the list, contact the Soils Hotline
(SoilsHotline@lin.usda.gov) to request a NASIS user account. For more information on
requesting NASIS user accounts, see part 639, subpart A, section 639.2, of this handbook.
2. Goals. Enter fiscal year goals in the \"Project Mapping Goal\" table at the beginning of each
fiscal year.
3. Progress:
a.) Enter mapping progress and show the effective progress reporting date in the \"Project
Mapping Progress\" table under the appropriate land category. Note: The reporting date
determines the fiscal year for progress reporting. Show initial and update mapping under
NRCS or cooperator columns, as appropriate. Update acres may be reported in any project
where update activity has occurred.
b.) Once initial soil survey mapping progress has been reported in a project, that progress
should not be moved to another project, unless an error was made in data entry. In order to
show the current progress for all land categories, however, progress may need to be reallocated
among land categories within the same project to reflect any changes in land ownership.
Note: For situations where land category acres have been rebalanced across projects, acres of
mapping progress reported for a land category may be more than the land category acres
shown for that project and, in some cases, the land category acres may even be zero.

Initial Acres. This item refers to mapping a soil survey area and reporting progress for the first time.
The cumulative initial acres reported for a completed survey area always equals 100 percent of the
survey area acres. The item applies to all lands of the Nation and mapping by both NRCS and
cooperator personnel and to mapping at any order of detail or scale. Typically, initial acres are
reported only for surveys having a nonproject or initial status but may apply to surveys with update
status where areas that were not mapped during the initial survey are mapped and reported for the first
time. Initial acres are reported only once for a given geographic area. All subsequent mapping on the
same ground is reported as update acres.
Update Acres. This item refers to updating and reporting progress on acres previously reported for the
Nation. All update acreage reported must be a part of a project plan entered in NASIS that was
approved by the MLRA management team for the soil survey region. Acres are reported when revised
data is posted to the Soil Data Warehouse.
Update projects consist of work that leads to significant changes in data or to work that confirms the
quality of the existing attribute data. This work typically, but not always, results in the recorrelation of
map units and their components. Update acres are reported even if the data and correlation are not
changed. Update projects are based on an inventory and assessment of existing soil survey
information and the deficiencies identified for correction. Refer to part 610 of this handbook for
guidance on conducting the inventory and assessment. An update project is established after
consideration of the work needed based on a project evaluation (described in part 610, subpart A,
section 610.4). The project is designed to address, either all or a reasonable subset of, related needs
that are identified for the area. One hundred percent of a map unit\'s acres are reported if update work
was conducted on all components. Update acres are not reported for map units for which the edited
component is used as a minor component. This situation pertains to map units that were not part of
field investigation but for which revisions were extrapolated to the attribute data for the minor
component.
Updates are based on field observations, which are either new observations or existing documentation.
All documentation used as the basis for updating official soil survey information is populated in
NASIS, either as recorded point data or as text notes indicating where the data is located. The
documentation is used as the basis for a change or to confirm the accuracy of the official data.
III. Imagery, Orthophotography, Map Compilation Materials, and Other Data Layers
These data elements are primarily the responsibility of State offices in their administrative and liaison
capacity between soil survey regional offices and National Cooperative Soil Survey partners within a
State. Field imagery, orthophotography, and map compilation materials may be needed for project
survey operations or SSURGO initiatives.
Beginning with NASIS 6.0, these needs are recorded in the \"Project Data Need\" table. Each type of
product or data needed should be recorded on a separate row in the \"Project Data Type\" column using
the choice list provided. Applicable dates need to be recorded in the \"Date\" columns.

IV. Initial and Update Survey Operations
These data elements relate most directly to production soil survey operations and therefore are the
responsibility of the soil survey regional offices. Data elements relative to the memorandum of
understanding for project areas and product types are jointly shared by State offices and soil survey
regional offices.

C. SSURGO Digitizing, Certification, and Archiving
SSURGO Operations. As part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, a SSURGO database is
developed for all areas. The Soil Science Division coordinates with NGCE in SSURGO database
development. Soil survey regional offices have soil business responsibilities for the correlation and
quality assurance of SSURGO products. The dataset is archived in the Soil Data Warehouse and
delivered via the Web Soil Survey and Geospatial Data Gateway.
SSURGO Progress Reporting. Progress and status for SSURGO development are tracked
continuously in NASIS. Business areas with responsibilities for SSURGO development also have
responsibility for populating the appropriate data elements in NASIS (refer to Section 608.13,
\"Business Area Responsibilities for Goals and Progress\"). Data stewards are designated to ensure
timely and accurate progress reporting.
SSURGO Certification. These data elements are the primary responsibility of the soil survey regional
office. If actual digitizing is not done by the soil survey regional office, States have responsibility for
populating \"digitizing started,\" \"digitizing percent,\" and \"digitizing completed\" prior to sending the
job to the digitizing unit for certification review. Dates and progress for the following milestones are
recorded in the \"Project Milestone\" and \"Project Milestone Progress\" tables as outlined in section
608.13.
-   \"Project Milestone\" Table
o Milestone Type Name = \"Digitize maps\"
o Milestone Date Started = date the digitizing was started (The final correlation
document, compilation certification, and attribute data are on file at the digitizing unit
before the work is started. Correspondence that grants an exception is on file at the soil
survey regional office.)
o Milestone Date Completed = date the digitizing was completed (Quality control work
by the State or the digitizing unit and quality assurance by the soil survey regional
office are typically done after the digitizing is complete and before the SSURGO
review is started.)
