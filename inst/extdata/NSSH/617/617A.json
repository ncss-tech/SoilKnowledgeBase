They can be used for establishing criteria for laws, programs, and regulations at local, State, and national levels. They assist the planning of broad categories of land use, such as cropland, rangeland, pastureland, forestland, or urban development. They are used to assist in preplanning and postplanning activities for national emergencies. Soil survey interpretations also help plan specific management practices that are applied to soils, such as irrigation of cropland or equipment use. Soil interpretations provide users of soil survey information with predictions of soil behavior to help in the development of reasonable and effective alternatives for the use and management of soil, water, air, plant, and animal resources. Prediction of soil behavior results from the observation and record of soil responses to specific uses and management practices, such as seasonal wet soil moisture status and the resultant effect in a basement. Recorded observations validate predictive models. The models project the expected behavior of similar soils from the behavior of observed soils.",

Important points as they relate to database population are summarized here. (i) The number of components listed for any map unit is kept to a minimum. Only those major and minor components required to understand and interpret the map unit should be entered in the database. Components used to describe a map unit should meet the following criteria. Each component- - Commonly exists in most delineations of the map unit (except for undifferentiated groups). - Contributes to the understanding of the map unit. - Contrasts with other major and minor components listed for the map unit. - Provides useful data and interpretations. (ii) Each major component is correlated to a series, taxadjunct, family, taxon above family, or miscellaneous area and is named accordingly. Similar soils, unless needed for the understanding of the map unit, are not listed as additional components. Rather they may be selectively incorporated into the data ranges populated for the properties and qualities of the named component (see part 618 of this handbook). (iii) Minor components occupy a relatively small percentage of the map unit. To be included in the database they should meet the four criteria listed in item 1 above. They are correlated to series, taxadjunct, family, taxon above family, or miscellaneous area as the kind of component. Two or more minor components that are contrasting with a named major component, but that are similar to one another, should be correlated to one minor soil component. The data ranges populated for the properties and qualities for this single component are reflective of the combined similar soils in the same way as is done for major components. (iv) Each component entered into the database is populated as fully as possible to maximize the understanding and interpretive value of the map unit.",

The calculation procedure is a set of instructions for the correct access to dataset entries. It is needed to sort criteria from a database without questioning the intention of the interpretation. The description should be specific to the database being used. Instructions for using high, low, or central values of data should be given in this description. (ii) Temporal Considerations for Application.-Identify time dependent or temporal properties or events from the measured permanent features of the soil. - Flooding and periods of freezing, wetness, or dryness are significant at the time they occur but not at all times. For example, in planning an installation phase, remember that this phase can be scheduled for alternate times when these events are not significant to the criteria. In these situations, temporal properties should not be part of the criteria unless a practice is being rated for a particular time of the year. - If temporal events are important for the permanent performance of the interpretation, then include them in the rating criteria. - State the soil moisture condition or the time of the year to which the interpretation applies. Since the conditions of soil moisture and soil freezing vary throughout the year and these conditions affect soil properties, criteria should define stated moisture conditions. Criteria can be developed for different times of the year by defining the criteria for the conditions that exist at the desired time of the year. Information on soil moisture status and freezing conditions are in NASIS. (iii) Reliability - Each soil property has a reliability connected to it. Soil property entries may come from measurements, derivations, or estimates. Consider the soil property reliability to inform the users of the reliability of the expected interpretation. - Properties can vary according to time of the year. If so, specify a time of the year for the interpretation. The reliability of the interpretation often depends on the seasonal variation of the property. Information presented to the user on temporal variation helps to describe the reliability of the interpretation. - Geographic reliability refers to the aerial extent to which an interpretation can be applied. Statements about the consistency, variability, or uniformity of a soil delineation help to define the geographic reliability of the interpretation. (iv) Testing.-Interpretations should be tested against the actual effects on activities or practice performance. Many properties and criteria need further refinement before they can be used. Some terms, such as flooding, require clarifying statements such as for velocity, depth, or duration. Sources of information other than NASIS soil interpretations may be available and should be considered at this stage of criteria development. Also consider related refinements and onsite investigations. - Keep in mind that a soil interpretation is for planning purposes. Additional refinements or other resource information can be used for site selection. Soil interpretations alone may not answer all the questions. Inform the intended user about other information that may be needed. Honestly express the limitations of the interpretation but do not undersell the information. Many users have no other resource information. - For the final site selection, an onsite investigation may be needed to provide information more specific than that collected and stored in a standard soil survey. Onsite investigation is recommended for expensive installations and for the determination of design criteria. - Use benchmark soils for testing interpretations. A benchmark soil and site description and the desired interpretation rating may help to stabilize the criteria. As criteria is developed and adjusted, test the criteria against the benchmark set of properties. - Report suspected errors and discrepancies in criteria or constructed interpretation logic to the owner of the interpretation. Contact the national leader for soil survey interpretations for national or standard interpretation errors. When reporting suspected errors in an interpretation include the following: - Name of the interpretation - Description of the suspected error - If known, detail the elements, rules, evaluations, properties, or logic construct that are the problems - Reference one or more soil survey map unit components that demonstrate the error - Interpretation owner will review and evaluate the reported error: - Determine if the interpretation indeed contains an error from its original intent - If after review and evaluation the owner determines that the interpretation is functioning as designed, notify the person reporting the error - If the interpretation does have an error, notify State soil scientists and NCSS cooperators of the interpretation that contains the error and consider changing the interpretation from \\\"Ready to Use\\\" status to \\\"No\\\" in NASIS",
