These official soil series descriptions document the taxa in the series category of the national system of taxonomic classification. They serve as specifications for identifying and classifying soils. Official series descriptions are maintained in a file storage system (“file share”) that is accessed by the staff in the SSR. Official series descriptions are updated and processed with a software application named the “SC/OSD Maintenance Tool.” As the SSR staff add or revise series for which they have responsibility, they transmit these series to the OSD file share where all series are stored. (ii) The OSD file share is both a transactional database maintained by the SSRs as well as a publication database available to the public. The read-only web access to official series descriptions provides the public the capability to view the individual series records, to query the database and produce a report with the selected soils, to produce national reports with all soils in the database, or to view maps identifying the distribution of series within the nation using the series extent mapping tool.

Along with the taxonomic classification, the database contains other information about the soil series, such as office of responsibility, series status, dates of origin and establishment, benchmark soil status, and geographic areas of usage. (i) The SC database is maintained by the NRCS soil SSR staff. As series are added to the official series description file, the soil classification file needs to be updated accordingly. The classification of a soil series listed on the official series description and that listed in the soil classification file are kept in agreement by the SSR staff. Additions and changes are continually being made as a result of ongoing soil survey work and refinement of the soil classification system. As the database is updated, the changes are immediately available to the user, so the data retrieved is always the most current. (ii) The SC database is both a transactional database maintained by the SSRs as well as a publication database available to the public. The read-only web access to this soil classification database provides the capability to view the contents of individual series records, to query the database on any data element and produce a report with the selected soils, or to produce national reports with all soils in the database.

(ii) AnalysisPC.—AnalysisPC is the complementary database and user application for analyzing pedon data. The database can be used to sort, select, aggregate, and compare data. It can also produce a written copy of the pedon description. Integration with a geographic information system (GIS) software program allows for spatial display of the locations of pedon data.

This system is designed to support the collection and analysis of soil samples, provide interpretation, manage and enhance the data, and disburse soil information in support of the NRCS Soil Survey Program. LIMS is a client-server system that allows the laboratory instruments and lab station computers to send analysis results to the central server. (i) As samples are sent to the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, they are assigned a unique sample number, labeled, and logged into LIMS. Information pertaining to the sample, pedon, site, and project associated with each sample is collected and stored. Each laboratory analysis request can be customized to use a particular preparation, along with other analysis-specific instructions. After the data entry, a project is prioritized and organized for work throughout the laboratory. (ii) LIMS provides an interface to communicate which preparations need to be performed on each sample and to collect weights and other data associated with the preparation of the sample. After dispositions are assigned to the prepared samples, the horizon samples appear on the work list within the laboratory. The raw data is then used to calculate results that are validated by the technicians for accuracy and reliability. LIMS has many reports written for custom application within the laboratory to assist technicians in completing their work.",

Created from the SDM data, customers can display soil maps, generate soil property or interpretive thematic maps, generate manuscript soil reports, and either print or save these products to their local computer. The Web Soil Survey allows customers to build a free custom soil survey manuscript through their selection of various maps and reports. (i) Data distributed from the Web Soil Survey is in the Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) format. For the tabular data, this format dictates which soil attributes are included, how those attributes are defined, how those attributes are grouped, and how those groups are related. For the spatial component, this format dictates which spatial layers are defined, which spatial layers are mandatory, and the standards to which that spatial data conforms. A metadata file in standard FGDC format is included with each dataset. (ii) Manuscript style reports are provided on Web Soil Survey for the public to retrieve basic soil property, quality, and interpretation information. Datasets can be downloaded that include the attribute and spatial databases for individual soil surveys.

SSURGO is the acronym for Soil SURvey GeOgraphic database. It is the most detailed level of mapping completed and is designed for use by landowners and for city and county general landuse planning purposes. For the tabular component, this format dictates which soil attributes are included, how those attributes are defined, how those attributes are grouped, and how those groups are related. For the spatial component, this format dictates which spatial layers are defined, which spatial layers are mandatory, and the standards to which that spatial data conforms. (i) The tabular component is distributed for use in Microsoft Access database software. This MS Access “SSURGO template database” is a soil survey publication consisting of the tabular data, table relationships, and a series of manuscript-style reports providing soil properties, qualities, and interpretations. The default SSURGO template is the national template (e.g., soildb_US_2002.mdb). States have the ability to customize a template database and provide publication reports for their needs (e.g., soildb_PA_2003.mdb). (ii) The spatial component is imported for use into a GIS program. Spatial data is available in several formats based on standards of the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI). These formats are ArcView shapefiles, ArcInfo coverages, or ArcInfo Interchange formats. Spatial layers include the soil survey area polygon and the map unit boundary polygons and can include the line map units, point map units, spot features, or a combination of these. Map unit boundary polygons in the digital map data are map unit delineations. The minimum delineation size ranges from 1.43 acres (0.57 hectare) to 5.7 acres (2.3 hectares). Themes for thematic maps are based on map units. Many map unit polygons can be labeled the same, but all point to the same record in the tabular map unit table.",

SDV integrates the spatial shapefile and attribute SSURGO template database and provides users access to soil interpretations and soil properties while shielding them from the complexity of the databases. SDV makes it easy to compute a single value for a map unit and display results, relieving the user from the burden of querying the database, processing the data, and linking to the spatial map. SDV contains processing rules to enforce appropriate use of the data. It provides the user with a tool for quick geospatial analysis of soil data for use in resource assessment and management.

The tabular and spatial components of the STATSGO2 database are available for download from the Web Soil Survey at this web address: http://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm. STATSGO2 data are available for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but missing for American Samoa, Guam, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau.

Linear delineations in the lower 48 continental States should be not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle generally ranges from 100 to 200 but may range up to about 400. Map unit boundary polygons in the digital map data are map unit delineations.
