Less documentation is generally needed for map units having only miscellaneous areas as major components. (i) The distinction between soils and miscellaneous areas is not always straightforward. Urban land and water are two miscellaneous areas that present correlation issues. In many instances, areas of urban land are underlain by recognizable soils. Similarly, some areas covered by water also support rooted subaquatic vegetation and meet the definition of soil (subaqueous soils). Judgment must be used to decide whether to recognize the soil or the miscellaneous area. In the case of urban land, the miscellaneous area is typically recognized when naming the map unit because it is the predominant determining factor for land use and management considerations. In the case of subaqueous soils, because the nature of the soils may be a critical consideration in the management of the resource, the map unit component chosen for correlation is a soil. In other instances where the management of the resource is not determined by an underlying subaqueous soil or where subaqueous soils do not occur (just non-vegetated sediment), the map unit component is correlated as the miscellaneous area water. The data needs of soil survey users are always a critical factor to consider when making basic correlation decisions about soils or miscellaneous areas. (ii) The concepts of some miscellaneous areas have changed with time. For example, rock outcrop is currently applied to areas of bedrock that possess a significant amount of geologic cementation to the point that exposures form distinctly angular surface profiles. When cementation is less, exposures of bedrock tend to form less angular but more sloping surface profiles due to geologic erosion processes acting upon softer rock. Such softer bedrock exposures are better correlated as badland to help eliminate confusion.",

Texture modifiers are available to reflect various soil properties of surface horizons such as rock fragments, pararock fragments, artifacts, fine- earth composition, carbon content, fiber content, and presence of limnic materials.

Use multiple judgments of informed soil scientists, agronomists, and conservationists. Use caution with schemes for calculating yields. (iii) Place yield estimates in the soil databases only after review by all States in which the map unit occurs. This is to ensure that the scientists consider all yield data and all experience with a soil map unit component. Yield estimates in the soil database reflect the representative values of the soil properties that are the most important for productivity. Normally, the results are estimated yields that are applicable throughout a major land resource area. Where such applicability is not achieved, the correlation of the soil map unit component may be in error or the range in climate of the resource area may be too wide. (iv) Yields in the soil database are for a high level of management. This is a level obtained by leading farmers that produce the highest economic returns per acre. It includes the best varieties; balancing plant populations and added nutrients to the potential of the soil; control of erosion, weeds, insects, and diseases; maintenance of optimum soil tilth; adequate soil drainage; and timely operations.",

The requirements for documentation written into the memorandum are based on the evaluation of the deficiencies in the map units of the previous soil survey. Refer to part 610 of this handbook for guidance on evaluations. For previously unmapped areas the requirements for documentation are based on the evaluation of the landscapes and map units of the surveys adjacent to the area. Generally map units that are not revised do not need further documentation other than that provided in the evaluation. Map units revised or redesigned need full documentation within the major land resource area. Because of the variable nature of parent material, landscape patterns, uniformity, land use, user needs, scale, access, and past documentation, flexibility is needed for requirements in the type and amount of field documentation for map units within each survey area. Agreements on documentation requirements that differ from standard field description standards should be spelled out in the memorandum of understanding for each survey area before field work starts. The soil survey regional office (SSR) takes the lead, as part of quality assurance, in assuring these standards are reasonable and adequate for correlation and interpretation and are addressed in the memorandum of understanding and project work plans.",

It is permissible to use pedons from surveys sharing the data mapunit from within the same major land resource area and MLRA legend. Tentatively classify all pedons at the time when they are described. After sufficient descriptions have been taken, establish a central concept and range for a kind of soil. Consult the official soil series descriptions to determine proper series placement.

      "content": "(2) The memorandum of understanding for the survey area, or project plan, provides guidance for the type and amount of documentation. Documentation needs and standards may vary by map unit within the same survey area. Flexibility of guidance allows for sufficient data collection for each map yet avoids the excess time and expense of redundant or superfluous data. (i) Proposed series require complete descriptions of at least 5 pedons for new series with an extent of less than 2,000 acres. New series with an extent of over 20,000 acres require 10 complete pedon descriptions. The number and distribution of pedon descriptions must be adequate to classify, differentiate, and develop a valid range of characteristics. Larger acreage units require more pedons descriptions to assure reasonable spatial representation across its extent. Laboratory data and field notes supplement these requirements. Part 614, Section 614.6, of this handbook provides helpful information on proposing a soil series. (ii) Map unit soil components each have a unique description. This representative pedon description exhibits typical properties and horizonation of the map unit component as it exists within the major land resource area. Each major soil component named within a map unit of the major land resource area legend requires one pedon description from the map unit. Minor components that are not named in a map unit of the legend but that occur in the component list of the database need a minimum of one pedon description. Provisional map units are exempted. This documentation is adequate for map units where the extent of the map unit is up to 3,000 acres. Where the extent is over 3,000 acres, the amount of additional descriptions are agreed upon and recorded in the memorandum of understanding. Factors that need to be considered are uniformity of material, scale, land use, and access. To ensure that documentation is adequate for the correlation of soil component names to established soil series or higher taxonomic categories, at least three pedon descriptions are required for each taxon used in the legend. Descriptions gathered to typify the map unit component as mentioned above and descriptions within adjacent surveys within the major land resource area are included in this total. (iii) Map units require a minimum of 30 recorded points for each map unit to document the composition. The points need to be distributed throughout the full extent of the map unit to account for spatial variability. Depending upon the nature of the map unit, the points can come from a fixed interval transect, a line transect (points selected to represent line segments related to vegetation, hillslope position, photo tone, etc.) or other techniques to ensure composition. This documentation is adequate where the extent of the map units are less than 2,000 acres. Where the extent is over 2,000 acres, add an additional 10 recorded points for each 4,000 acres. Sufficient documentation typically exists when the number of recorded points reach 60, given adequate spatial distribution. Due to unique situations and variability, the memorandum of understanding state specific requirements as needed based on uniformity of material, scale, land use, or access. Where applicable, the use of statistics can be helpful in determining the adequacy of recorded points. (iv) Exceptions to the minimum standards for documentation of map units and map unit components apply when adding small acreage map units along the boundary of an ongoing soil survey or modern published soil survey. Section 627.3 provides more details on map units of small extent. In these cases use the documentation from the joining soil survey area that has the larger acreage for correlation. The SSO regularly review and summarize all documentation. Where applicable, a statistical analysis of data is done to objectively evaluate soil properties and map unit composition. The descriptive legend, manuscript, and database are updated periodically based on progressively gathered documentation. Documentation undergoes a quality assurance review at regular intervals by the SSRO. Determinations are made about the documentation in regard to- -    Attaining the outcomes as stated above. -    Meeting the Field Description Standards (or standards modified in the MOU). -    Identifying the need for additional documentation.",

(i) Identification Legend.-The identification legend consists of a list of map unit symbols and map unit names. Prepare the identification legend from map units and map unit components proposed and described. Only list those map units whose occurrence and justification were established during mapping. The SSO or staff maintains records of all symbols and proposed changes to the identification legend. Field reviews record legend changes that are approved by the SSR. The field review reports must account for all the map units and symbols used at any time during the survey. All field review reports include an updated identification legend. The National Soil Information System is the official depository of legends, correlation notes, and legend text. Chapter 4 of the Soil Survey Manual describes the identification legend. - The legend is sorted numerically or alphabetically by map unit symbol. Numerically sort and publish the legend, map units, and tables where map unit symbols (or labels) are numeric or alpha-numeric. Alphabetically sort and publish the legend, map units, and tables where map unit symbols (or labels) are alphabetical. - Symbols.-Map unit symbols are descriptive labels on soil maps. They are designed in a manner that avoids confusion with other symbols shown on soil maps representing specific features, such as those in the \\\"Feature and Symbol Legend for Soil Survey\\\" (section 627.14). Soil survey map unit symbols combine alpha, alphanumeric, or numeric characters. Section 627.13 gives several examples. Symbols should be as short as possible, but may contain up to six characters, including special characters like hyphens. Avoid the use of the lowercase letters \\\"i,\\\" \\\"j,\\\" \\\"q,\\\" and \\\"l\\\" because when handwritten these letters are easily confused with other letters or the number 1. - Slope Phases.-Identification of a slope phase with a symbol is optional. However, a capital letter (A through G) commonly identifies a map unit slope phase. Examples are AoB for Alpha loam, 3 to 6 percent slopes, and 123B for Alpha sandy loam, 3 to 6 percent slopes. If two or more slope groups, such as 3 and 6 percent and 6 to 9 percent, combine during correlation into a map unit, such as 3 to 9 percent slopes, only use one letter to identify slope. Use the symbol for the most restrictive slope from the named components if you combine slope groups. Consider using separate components, each with their own slope group, if these components would be dissimilar. (ii) Feature and Symbol Legend for Soil Survey - Each soil survey area requires a Feature and Symbol Legend for Soil Survey (NRCS- SOI-37A). See section 627.14. The legend identifies all approved map features that may be published in soil surveys including- - Area, line, and point soil features including soil boundary lines and soil symbols. - Ad hoc features and standard landform and miscellaneous surface features that are too small to be delineated as areas on soil map sheets at either 1:12,000 (<1.4 acres) or 1:24,000 (<5.7 acres) scale. - Cultural features, such as structures, political boundaries, road emblems, and airports. - Hydrographic features, such as streams, springs, and wells. - The descriptions of the standard landform and miscellaneous surface features are on the back of the Form NRCS-SOI-37A. If the legend includes ad hoc features, write the description on the back of the NRCS-SOI-37A. - Use standard landform and miscellaneous surface features or ad hoc features to show local areas of significantly contrasting soils or features too small to delineate at the publication scale. The need for these features depends on their significance to present or projected use of the soils and the soil map. These features are primarily for location purposes and only surface determined properties or responses define them. These features are not used to indicate soils or features that are identified in the name or description of the map unit delineated. Nor are these features used as identifying symbols in small delineations. - Define ad hoc features on the 37A in the section entitled \\\"Descriptions for Ad Hoc Features.\\\" Define the specific kind and size of the area represented. - All symbols must correspond exactly to those listed on Form NRCS-SOI-37A. - The SSO prepares the first draft of the feature and symbol legend before the initial field review of the survey area using the NRCS-SOI-37A. The review report includes the NRCS-SOI-37A. The back of the form includes the rules of application. All subsequent progress field reviews update and approve changes to this legend. Underline or otherwise highlight those features that are selected. Only compile those features that are highlighted. (iii) Descriptions and Classification of the Soils - Throughout the course of the survey, the SSO describes all map units and map unit components. The SSR approves these units before they are added to the identification legend. The SSO makes minor revisions, such as adding minor components to map units, broadening the range for the taxonomic unit, or improving descriptions of the shape of delineations of the map unit. - The SSR approves major changes, such as the addition or deletion of a map unit or the change in concept of a taxonomic unit. The SSR prescribes the manner for submitting proposals for additions or deletions, and the supporting information. Make approved changes in all copies of the descriptive legend, including those used by the SSO and the SSR or lead agency. Keep a complete record of all major revisions and record these revisions and the reasons for them in the report of the first field review that is made after the revisions are proposed. The National Soil Information System is the official depository of legends, correlation notes, and legend text. - The SSR or the appropriate supervisor of the lead agency arranges procedures with cooperating agencies to obtain their concurrence to revisions of the legend.
