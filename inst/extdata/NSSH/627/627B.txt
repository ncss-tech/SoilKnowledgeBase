627.10 Miscellaneous Areas
Miscellaneous areas have essentially no soil or are bodies of soil that are heavily disturbed. They can
result from active erosion and deposition, flooding and ponding, unfavorable edaphic conditions, or
human activities. Some miscellaneous areas can be made productive, but only after major reclamation
efforts. The paragraphs below discuss the 20 miscellaneous areas that are approved for use as component
names. No other miscellaneous area names are used. See section 627.4F(2) for the process to revise the
list of areas. Phase terms are not populated in the component name column of the database. Map unit
names can consist of the concatenated miscellaneous area name and the local phase term (e.g., “Water,
saline”). Local phase terms are developed as needed and have no finite limit or national approval process.
Badland is moderately steep to very steep barren land that is dissected by many intermittent drainage
channels. Ordinarily, the areas are not stony. Badland is most common in semiarid and arid regions
where streams and surface runoff have cut into soft bedrock such as shale. Local relief generally ranges
from 10 to 200 meters in height. Potential runoff is very high and erosion is active.
Beaches are sandy, gravelly, or cobbly shores that are washed and rewashed by waves. The areas may be
partly covered with water during high tides or storms.
Chutes are elongated areas on steep mountain slopes. The vegetation has been removed by avalanche or
mass movement processes. Chutes consist of exposed bedrock, rock fragments, and large woody debris.
Their slopes are parallel to the slope of the mountain and their lengths are at least ten times their widths.
Cinder land is composed of loose cinders and other scoriaceous tephra. The water-holding capacity of the
tephra is very low and the trafficability is poor. Cinder land is commonly associated with cinder cone
volcanoes, but not all cinder land occurs on the flanks of volcanic hills or mountains.
Dams are artificial structures, oriented across a watercourse or natural drainage area, for the purpose of
impounding or diverting water.
Dumps are areas of smoothed or uneven accumulations or piles of waste rock and general refuse. Some
dumps that are closely associated with pits are mapped as a complex map unit of dumps and pits.
Dune land consists of sand in ridges and intervening troughs that shift with the wind.
Glaciers are large masses of ice that formed, at least in part, on land by the compaction and
recrystallization of snow. They may be moving slowly downslope or outward in all directions because of
the stress of their own weight, they may be retreating, or they may be stagnant. Rocks and some earthy
material may be on the surface of or imbedded within the ice. Permanent snowfields are associated with
glaciers in some regions.
Gullied land consists of areas where erosion has cut a network of V-shaped or U-shaped channels. The
areas resemble miniature badlands. Generally, gullies are so deep that extensive reshaping is necessary

for most uses. Small areas can be shown by spot symbols. Phases that indicate the kind of material
remaining may be useful for some areas.
Lava flows are areas covered with barren lava. In most humid regions, the flows are of Holocene age, but
in arid and very cold regions they may be older. Some flows have sharp, jagged surfaces, crevices, and
angular blocks that are characteristic of slow-moving viscous lava. The Hawaiian term for a basaltic lava
flow with these features is named “aa.” Other lava flows are relatively smooth and have a ropy, glazed
surface due to hotter eruption temperatures, lower viscosity, and rapid flow rates. The Hawaiian term for
this form of lava flow is “pahoehoe.” A little earthy material, ash, cinders, or accumulations of fresh
organic material may be in a few fractures and sheltered pockets, but the flows are virtually devoid of
soil. Lava flows have no vegetation other than lichens or other plant life growing in small pockets.
Mined land is areas which are significantly altered by mining activities. Soil material and rock has been
moved into, out of, or within the areas designated. Because access to mined land may be limited by
permissions or hazardous materials, identification of soil components can be difficult or impossible.
Mined land may also have associated small excavations which could be correlated and delineated as pits
if needed.
Oil-waste land consists of areas where liquid oily wastes, principally of salt water and oil, have
accumulated. It includes slush pits and adjacent areas that are affected by the liquid wastes. The land is
barren, although some of it can be reclaimed at high cost.
Pits are open excavations from which soil and commonly underlying material have been removed,
exposing either rock or other material. Common kinds of pits are those that result from mining, gravel
operations, and quarries. Pits are often closely associated with dumps.
Playas are barren flats in closed basins in arid regions. The largest playas occupy the dry beds of ancient,
pluvial lakes. The sediments in playas are mainly fine-grained lacustrine deposits that accumulate from
silt and clay particles settling in still water. Many playas are subject to removal of sediments by wind
action and are a local source of fine particulate matter. Many playas are saline, sodic, or both and may
have mineral crusts of soluble salts. Some nearly level playas are subject to intermittent ponding
following periods of heavy precipitation, snowmelt, or both. The water table may be near the surface at
times, or it may remain at depth.
Riverwash is unstabilized sandy, silty, clayey, or gravelly sediment that is flooded, washed, and reworked
frequently by rivers or streams that little or no vegetation can become established. The recent deposition
of fresh alluvium precludes soil development.
Rock outcrop consists of exposures of barren bedrock, other than lava flows, chutes, and rock-lined pits.
Some areas are large and are only broken by small areas of soil. Most rock outcrops are hard rock, but
some are soft rock such as thin beds of weakly cemented shale interbedded with thick beds of strongly
cemented sandstone.
Rubble land consists of areas of cobbles, flagstones, stones, and boulders in unstable deposits of sufficient
thickness to significantly limit the establishment of vegetation. Rubble land is commonly at the base of
mountains but in some areas consists of deposits of large rock fragments left on mountain slopes by
glaciation or by periglacial processes.
Slickens are accumulations of fine textured material, such as that separated in placer mine and ore mill
operations. Slickens from ore mills consist largely of freshly ground rock that commonly has undergone
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook

627-B.3
chemical treatment during the milling process. Slickens are usually confined in specially constructed
basins and are often contaminated by metallic compounds.
Urban land is land covered by pavement, buildings, storage tanks, bridges, and other impervious, human-
manufactured surfaces and structures. Pavement is a hard-layered surface of concrete or asphalt that
forms a walkway, road, street, highway lane, runway, parking lot, or similar paved area. Urban land can
occur in urban areas such as large cities and industrial centers as well as in suburban neighborhoods and
rural towns. If correlated properly, urban land consists of 100-percent manufactured surface. Older soil
surveys correlating urban land with a less strict concept may consist of as little as 75-percent
manufactured surface. Some modern soil surveys require identification of the materials below urban land.
Urban land is an anthropogenic type of miscellaneous area that does not necessarily represent a
permanent condition.
Water includes streams, lakes, ponds, and estuaries more than about 2.5 meters deep or less than 2.5
meters deep and lacks either distinguishable horizons or rooted vegetation in the bottom sediment. These
areas are covered with water in most years, at least during the period that is warm enough for plants to
grow. Many areas are covered throughout the year. Pits and playas that contain water most of the time
are mapped as water.

627.17 Matrix of Investigation Intensity of Soil Surveys and Documentation
The table below is a generalized matrix showing investigation intensity of soil survey (order) by the
dominant type of documentation.
Within physiographic areas, percentages for the number of delineations can be assigned to the entries to
specify required documentation. (i.e., 25% would indicate 25 of 100 delineations)
Key type of documentation to verify or identify map units in soil delineations

---------- Secondary Primary Primary
Key type of documentation to determine composition of a map unit
Transecting ---------- Primary Primary Primary
Identification or verification of soil map units with a delineation is made by one of three methods. These
methods provide documentation to the survey when the method is either recorded in the database or on the
map as to type. These methods are—
-Traversing – Describing the soil and conditions at stops selected to reference vegetation, position on the
landform, photo tone, etc. This is an onsite identification of the soil and verification of the projected
assignment of the map unit.
-Observation – Visual notation of items as geologic features, vegetation, surface conditions, disturbed
areas, etc. without borings. This drive by or other sighted observation does not involve a soil examination,
and instead relies on surface characteristics observed by the surveyor.
-Remotely sensed/ancillary data – includes photo tone on aerial photographs, three-dimensional digital
elevation models, topographic maps, geology maps, vegetative maps, etc.
-Primary – the principal way polygons and properties are verified.
-Secondary – additional methods in support of primary methods.
-No entry – This category is generally not used in the specified order.
-Transecting – Describing the soils and conditions at points (or continuously as with GPR) along a fixed
length at regular intervals or by selecting points to represent measured line segments of various patterns.
Transecting is used to identify the composition of a delineation and to design a map unit. A very small
percentage of the total number of delineations of any one map unit have transects unless there are very few
delineations of the map unit. As soil order increases the length and intervals of the transect would
generally increase. A transect is different from grid or line mapping used for determining line placement.
