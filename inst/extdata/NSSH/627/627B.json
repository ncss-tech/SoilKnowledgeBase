      "content": "Miscellaneous areas have essentially no soil or are bodies of soil that are heavily disturbed. They can result from active erosion and deposition, flooding and ponding, unfavorable edaphic conditions, or human activities. Some miscellaneous areas can be made productive, but only after major reclamation efforts. The paragraphs below discuss the 20 miscellaneous areas that are approved for use as component names. No other miscellaneous area names are used. See section 627.4F(2) for the process to revise the list of areas. Phase terms are not populated in the component name column of the database. Map unit names can consist of the concatenated miscellaneous area name and the local phase term (e.g., \\\"Water, saline\\\"). Local phase terms are developed as needed and have no finite limit or national approval process. Badland is moderately steep to very steep barren land that is dissected by many intermittent drainage channels. Ordinarily, the areas are not stony. Badland is most common in semiarid and arid regions where streams and surface runoff have cut into soft bedrock such as shale. Local relief generally ranges from 10 to 200 meters in height. Potential runoff is very high and erosion is active. Beaches are sandy, gravelly, or cobbly shores that are washed and rewashed by waves. The areas may be partly covered with water during high tides or storms. Chutes are elongated areas on steep mountain slopes. The vegetation has been removed by avalanche or mass movement processes. Chutes consist of exposed bedrock, rock fragments, and large woody debris. Their slopes are parallel to the slope of the mountain and their lengths are at least ten times their widths. Cinder land is composed of loose cinders and other scoriaceous tephra. The water-holding capacity of the tephra is very low and the trafficability is poor. Cinder land is commonly associated with cinder cone volcanoes, but not all cinder land occurs on the flanks of volcanic hills or mountains. Dams are artificial structures, oriented across a watercourse or natural drainage area, for the purpose of impounding or diverting water. Dumps are areas of smoothed or uneven accumulations or piles of waste rock and general refuse. Some dumps that are closely associated with pits are mapped as a complex map unit of dumps and pits. Dune land consists of sand in ridges and intervening troughs that shift with the wind. Glaciers are large masses of ice that formed, at least in part, on land by the compaction and recrystallization of snow. They may be moving slowly downslope or outward in all directions because of the stress of their own weight, they may be retreating, or they may be stagnant. Rocks and some earthy material may be on the surface of or imbedded within the ice. Permanent snowfields are associated with glaciers in some regions. Gullied land consists of areas where erosion has cut a network of V-shaped or U-shaped channels. The areas resemble miniature badlands. Generally, gullies are so deep that extensive reshaping is necessary for most uses. Small areas can be shown by spot symbols. Phases that indicate the kind of material remaining may be useful for some areas. Lava flows are areas covered with barren lava. In most humid regions, the flows are of Holocene age, but in arid and very cold regions they may be older. Some flows have sharp, jagged surfaces, crevices, and angular blocks that are characteristic of slow-moving viscous lava. The Hawaiian term for a basaltic lava flow with these features is named \\\"aa.\\\" Other lava flows are relatively smooth and have a ropy, glazed surface due to hotter eruption temperatures, lower viscosity, and rapid flow rates. The Hawaiian term for this form of lava flow is \\\"pahoehoe.\\\" A little earthy material, ash, cinders, or accumulations of fresh organic material may be in a few fractures and sheltered pockets, but the flows are virtually devoid of soil. Lava flows have no vegetation other than lichens or other plant life growing in small pockets. Mined land is areas which are significantly altered by mining activities. Soil material and rock has been moved into, out of, or within the areas designated. Because access to mined land may be limited by permissions or hazardous materials, identification of soil components can be difficult or impossible. Mined land may also have associated small excavations which could be correlated and delineated as pits if needed. Oil-waste land consists of areas where liquid oily wastes, principally of salt water and oil, have accumulated. It includes slush pits and adjacent areas that are affected by the liquid wastes. The land is barren, although some of it can be reclaimed at high cost. Pits are open excavations from which soil and commonly underlying material have been removed, exposing either rock or other material. Common kinds of pits are those that result from mining, gravel operations, and quarries. Pits are often closely associated with dumps. Playas are barren flats in closed basins in arid regions. The largest playas occupy the dry beds of ancient, pluvial lakes. The sediments in playas are mainly fine-grained lacustrine deposits that accumulate from silt and clay particles settling in still water. Many playas are subject to removal of sediments by wind action and are a local source of fine particulate matter. Many playas are saline, sodic, or both and may have mineral crusts of soluble salts. Some nearly level playas are subject to intermittent ponding following periods of heavy precipitation, snowmelt, or both. The water table may be near the surface at times, or it may remain at depth. Riverwash is unstabilized sandy, silty, clayey, or gravelly sediment that is flooded, washed, and reworked frequently by rivers or streams that little or no vegetation can become established. The recent deposition of fresh alluvium precludes soil development. Rock outcrop consists of exposures of barren bedrock, other than lava flows, chutes, and rock-lined pits. Some areas are large and are only broken by small areas of soil. Most rock outcrops are hard rock, but some are soft rock such as thin beds of weakly cemented shale interbedded with thick beds of strongly cemented sandstone. Rubble land consists of areas of cobbles, flagstones, stones, and boulders in unstable deposits of sufficient thickness to significantly limit the establishment of vegetation. Rubble land is commonly at the base of mountains but in some areas consists of deposits of large rock fragments left on mountain slopes by glaciation or by periglacial processes. Slickens are accumulations of fine textured material, such as that separated in placer mine and ore mill operations. Slickens from ore mills consist largely of freshly ground rock that commonly has undergone chemical treatment during the milling process. Slickens are usually confined in specially constructed basins and are often contaminated by metallic compounds. Urban land is land covered by pavement, buildings, storage tanks, bridges, and other impervious, human- manufactured surfaces and structures. Pavement is a hard-layered surface of concrete or asphalt that forms a walkway, road, street, highway lane, runway, parking lot, or similar paved area. Urban land can occur in urban areas such as large cities and industrial centers as well as in suburban neighborhoods and rural towns. If correlated properly, urban land consists of 100-percent manufactured surface. Older soil surveys correlating urban land with a less strict concept may consist of as little as 75-percent manufactured surface. Some modern soil surveys require identification of the materials below urban land. Urban land is an anthropogenic type of miscellaneous area that does not necessarily represent a permanent condition. Water includes streams, lakes, ponds, and estuaries more than about 2.5 meters deep or less than 2.5 meters deep and lacks either distinguishable horizons or rooted vegetation in the bottom sediment. These areas are covered with water in most years, at least during the period that is warm enough for plants to grow. Many areas are covered throughout the year. Pits and playas that contain water most of the time are mapped as water.",

These methods provide documentation to the survey when the method is either recorded in the database or on the map as to type. These methods are- -Traversing - Describing the soil and conditions at stops selected to reference vegetation, position on the landform, photo tone, etc. This is an onsite identification of the soil and verification of the projected assignment of the map unit. -Observation - Visual notation of items as geologic features, vegetation, surface conditions, disturbed areas, etc. without borings. This drive by or other sighted observation does not involve a soil examination, and instead relies on surface characteristics observed by the surveyor. -Remotely sensed/ancillary data - includes photo tone on aerial photographs, three-dimensional digital elevation models, topographic maps, geology maps, vegetative maps, etc. -Primary - the principal way polygons and properties are verified. -Secondary - additional methods in support of primary methods. -No entry - This category is generally not used in the specified order. -Transecting - Describing the soils and conditions at points (or continuously as with GPR) along a fixed length at regular intervals or by selecting points to represent measured line segments of various patterns. Transecting is used to identify the composition of a delineation and to design a map unit. A very small percentage of the total number of delineations of any one map unit have transects unless there are very few delineations of the map unit. As soil order increases the length and intervals of the transect would generally increase. A transect is different from grid or line mapping used for determining line placement.",
