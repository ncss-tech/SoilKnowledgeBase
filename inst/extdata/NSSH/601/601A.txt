Part 601 - National Cooperative Soil Survey Organization
Subpart A - General Information
601.0 Definition
A. The National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) is a nationwide partnership of Federal, regional,
State, and local agencies and private entities and institutions. This partnership works to cooperatively
investigate, inventory, document, classify, interpret, disseminate, and publish information about soils
of the United States and its trust territories and commonwealths. The activities of the NCSS are
carried out on national, regional (such as the major land resource area, or MLRA), and State levels.
B. NRCS is responsible for the leadership of soil survey activities of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, for the leadership and coordination of NCSS activities, and for the extension of soil
survey technology to global applications. Additional information about the Soil Survey Program is in
the NRCS general manual (http://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/RollupViewer.aspx?hid=16988) under
Title 430, Part 402.
C. Primary Federal agency NCSS participants include the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of
Land Management (BLM), Department of Defense (DoD), Forest Service (FS), National Park Service
(NPS), and NRCS. Part 601, subpart B, section 601.10, has a short description of the roles of these
partners. In addition to these Federal agency partners, there are numerous State and local partners
participating in the NCSS. Information about the organization and responsibilities of partner agencies
is contained in their policy documents.
