Soil surveys are primarily at 1:24,000 scale to support decision-making processes for land management. Soil surveys are needed for farming, community planning, land development, and grazing and forest management. Soil survey and ecological site data are necessary for land health assessments, grazing permit renewal, energy and mineral permitting and leasing, restoration of natural fire processes, restoration of the health of the land, maintenance of clean water and air, and invasive plant control. Soil information is fundamental in assessing soil capabilities, limitations, and vulnerability to degradation and loss of capacity so that the health of the land can be sustained. Because Native American lands are considered private lands, NRCS has the responsibility to complete soil surveys on Native American lands. Soil surveys are completed in conjunction with BIA soil scientists and other staff.",

BLM-administered land include a diverse mosaic of grassland, shrub land, forest, desert, and arctic and alpine ecosystems on extensive landscapes that range from nearly level playas to steep, rugged mountains. These landscapes and ecosystems contain a wide variety of soils with diverse properties that can significantly affect use and management. BLM manages a wide variety of resources and uses, including energy and minerals, livestock forage, fish and wildlife habitat, timber, wild horse and burro populations, watershed values, wilderness and recreation areas, and cultural and other natural heritage values. BLM administers public land within a framework of numerous laws and regulations, including FLPMA, NEPA, and State water- quality laws. Soils are one of the most fundamental natural resources on public land. Soils sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the land. Soil quality and health are the driving forces that determine these factors.",

Each service either names NRCS as the source from which to obtain soils data or requires that the soil survey be done according to NCSS standards and procedures. Each installation\\'s mission normally dictates the level of detail needed. The Army\\'s standard is a 1:12,000-scale soil survey to support installations where millions of miles are used for land-intensive mission training, including vehicle use (from ATVs to main battle tanks). On installations that DoD is closing, those involved in clean-up efforts often require order-2 soil surveys to understand the effects of chemicals and constituents of concern and how to safely manage their transport. Installations that need a soil survey enter into an agreement with NRCS through the SSRs in which the installation is located. At the installation\\'s request, the soil survey may be restricted from public access due to national security concerns.",
