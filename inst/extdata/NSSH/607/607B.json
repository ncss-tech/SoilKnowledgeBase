Saving edits is different from saving the geodatabase. -- Topology is frequently validated, and errors are fixed while editing. -- The geodatabases are compacted in ArcCatalog.  Weekly.—All new or edited soil mapping data is copied onto a CD or DVD and stored offsite for security. Updates can be added to previous media in order to maintain an archive of edited versions.  Monthly.—When soil mapping data are being updated, a copy of the geodatabase is sent by compressing it into a WinZip file and attaching this file to an email (or on a CD or DVD) to designated GIS staff. If no edits have been made, this is not necessary.  Annually.—After completing a 100-percent quality control review of the digital data, the project leader sends a copy of the overall geodatabase to the soil survey regional office for quality assurance.",
