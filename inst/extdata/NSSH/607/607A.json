      "content": "607.0 Purpose This part of the National Soil Survey Handbook (NSSH) is focused on initial soil surveys. In rare cases, existing soil surveys require such extensive revision that complete remapping is required. The extensive revision of non-MLRA soil survey areas has been phased out and replaced with the process of updating map units on an MLRA basis. Updating soil surveys is addressed in part 610 of this handbook. The purpose of initial soil survey preparation is to ensure the efficient use of staff time and equipment and to meet the intent of the soil survey. The preparations help the soil survey office staff understand the intent and specifications detailed in the memorandum of understanding (MOU) and the specific timeline and deliverables detailed in the plan of operation.",

The Soil Survey Project Long-Range Plan The soil survey project long-range plan (along with the project soil survey area MOU, if one is used) specifies the deliverables and sets the time period for the completion of the soil survey. The time period specified for an initial soil survey project is recorded in the NASIS “Legend” table. Although initial soil surveys are planned and organized to complete a defined soil survey area, these survey areas are essentially a subset of the MLRA soil survey area and need to be managed within that larger physiographic context. Initial soil survey projects are scheduled for completion within about a 5-year period. Staffing should correspond to this scheduled completion period. If estimated completion time of an initial soil survey project is more than about 5 years, staffing should be reconsidered or the project should be subdivided into more manageable areas.",
