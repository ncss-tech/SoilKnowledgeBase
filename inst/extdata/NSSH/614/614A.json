The name used is generally from a taxon of the lowest category that identifies the dominant kinds of soil. Chapter 7 of Soil Taxonomy provides more information on the derivation of the nomenclature, definition of the terminology, and structure of the taxonomic names. Even though names of one or more taxonomic classes identify components of map units, components are not the same as soil taxa. If the fixed limits of soil taxa are superimposed on the pattern of soils in nature, the limits of taxonomic classes rarely coincide precisely with mappable areas. In addition to the named component or components, a map unit commonly includes components of minor extent that may be similar or dissimilar to the named soil. Part 627 of this handbook discusses major and minor map unit components and dissimilar and similar soils.",

These variables could result in differences as large as a full interval between chips in the Munsell color system. The differences in identification of soil color resulting from one person looking at the same specimen at different times and under different conditions or from a group of individuals looking at the same specimen together are an example of normal errors of observation. Optimum field conditions allow soil color to be matched to within one-half interval between chips on the color chart. The normal range of difference between careful observations is plus or minus a half interval between chips of the same hue or between chips of the same value and chroma on adjacent hues.

This rule applies to the entire soil series control section and any of its parts. Not all differences among soil series are obvious. The limit between the fine-loamy and fine particle-size classes is a clay content of 35 percent. The experienced mapper has little difficulty in distinguishing between 30 percent and 40 percent clay. However, only the laboratory can consistently distinguish between 34 percent and 36 percent clay content. If this is the only difference, the distinction is not important for most uses of the soil map. Name the map unit for either of the two soil series that have a common conceptual boundary at 35 percent clay. Differences that are no greater than the normal errors of observation can cause many needless decisions, even for an experienced mapper.

Before changing the status of a soil series to inactive, the SSR with responsibility for the series sends a memorandum of intentions and supporting reasons to affected State soil scientists and SSRs. The responsible SSR notifies members of other disciplines and cooperators who may use the series name in databases and publications. About 45 days are allowed for filing objections to the recommendation. If the SSR determines that the soil series should be made inactive, it notifies the affected regions. The memorandum includes the reclassification to the appropriate soil series or to a taxon of a higher category of all pedons in the inactive series that have been sampled and analyzed by NRCS, cooperating universities, highway departments, or other laboratories. Inactive soil series are retained in the soil series classification database.

The SSR also enters the year that the soil series is established in both the soil series classification database and the official series description file and then enters the name of the survey area (which may be a MLRA) in which it is established. The SSR uses the SC/OSD maintenance tool (a Web application protected by USDA eAuthentication) to perform these tasks.
