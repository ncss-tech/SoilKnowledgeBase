The seven resource attributes used in defining land resource units are climate, geology, soils, vegetation, water resources, physiography, and land use. The role each attribute plays in the determination and naming of a resource area varies, and its importance depends upon the level within the hierarchy. Some resource areas exhibit a high degree of uniformity across the entire landscape. Other resource areas are characterized by a high degree of variation that occurs in a predictable and repeatable pattern. Still other resource areas represent significant or unique environments.",

The third level of the hierarchy is the land resource unit (LRU). The land resource unit represents related landforms that make up the landscape. Land resource units are defined primarily by significant differences between one or two of the resource attributes.
