Part 629 - Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms
Subpart A - General Information
629.0 Definition and Purpose
This glossary provides the NCSS soil survey program, soil scientists, and natural resource specialists
with landform, geologic, and related terms and their definitions to-
(1) Improve soil landscape description with a standard, single source landform and geologic
glossary.
(2) Enhance geomorphic content and clarity of soil map unit descriptions by use of accurate,
defined terms.
(3) Establish consistent geomorphic term usage in soil science and the National Cooperative Soil
Survey (NCSS).
(4) Provide standard geomorphic definitions for databases and soil survey technical publications.
(5) Train soil scientists and related professionals in soils as landscape and geomorphic entities.
629.1 Responsibilities
This glossary serves as the official NCSS reference for landform, geologic, and related terms. The
staff of the National Soil Survey Center, located in Lincoln, NE, is responsible for maintaining and
updating this glossary. Soil Science Division staff and NCSS participants are encouraged to propose
additions and changes to the glossary for use in pedon descriptions, soil map unit descriptions, and
soil survey publications. The Glossary of Geology (GG, 2005) serves as a major source for many
glossary terms. The American Geologic Institute (AGI) granted the USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation Service) permission (in letters dated September
11, 1985, and September 22, 1993) to use existing definitions. Sources of, and modifications to,
original definitions are explained immediately below.

colluvial action, and running water. Compare - summit, shoulder, footslope, toeslope. GSST

(56) badlands.-A landscape that is intricately dissected and characterized by a very fine
drainage network with high drainage densities and short, steep slopes with narrow interfluves.
Badlands develop on surfaces with little or no vegetative cover, overlying unconsolidated or

ballena is a fan remnant large enough to retain some relict fan surface on a remnant summit.
Compare - fan remnant. SW and FFP
(60) ballon.-(colloquial: western United States) A rounded, dome-shaped hill, formed either by
erosion or uplift. GG

(i) [streams] A general landform term for a ridge-like accumulation of sand, gravel, or other
alluvial material formed in the channel, along the banks, or at the mouth of a stream
where a decrease in velocity induces deposition (e.g., a channel bar or a meander bar).
(ii) [coast] A generic landform term for any of various elongate offshore ridges, banks, or
mounds of sand, gravel, or other unconsolidated material submerged at least at high tide,
and built up by the action of waves or currents, especially at the mouth of a river or
estuary, or at a slight distance offshore from the beach. Compare - longshore bar. GG
and GSST
(iii) [microfeature term] A small, sinuous or arcuate, ridge-like lineation on a flood plain and

topography. Compare - meander scroll. SW
(62) bar and channel topography.-A local-scale topographic pattern of recurring, small,
sinuous or arcuate ridges separated by shallow troughs irregularly spaced across low-relief
flood plains (slopes generally 2 to 6%); the effect is one of a subdued, sinuously undulating
surface that is common on active, meandering flood plains. Microelevational differences
between bars and channels generally range from <0.5 to 2 m and are largely controlled by the
competency of the stream. The ridge-like bars often consist of somewhat coarser sediments
compared to the finer textured sediments of the microlow troughs. Compare - meander
scroll, meander belt. SW
(63) barchan dune.-A crescent-shaped dune with tips extending leeward (downwind), making
this side concave and the windward (upwind) side convex. Barchan dunes tend to be
arranged in chains extending in the dominant wind direction. Compare - parabolic dune. HP

separating the exposed or seaward edge of a barrier beach or barrier island from the lagoon
behind it. An assemblage of both deflation flats left behind migrating dunes and/or storm
washover sediments; may be either barren or vegetated. Compare - barrier beach, back-
barrier flat. SSS
(69) barrier island.-A long, narrow, sandy island, that is above high tide and parallel to the
shore that commonly has dunes, vegetated zones, and swampy or marshy terrains extending
lagoonward from the beach. Compare - barrier beach. GG

(1159) yardang
(i) A microfeature in the form of a long, irregular, sharp-crested, undercut ridge between two
round-bottomed troughs, carved on a plateau or unsheltered plain in a desert region by
wind erosion, and cut into soft but coherent deposits (such as clayey sand); it lies in the
direction of the dominant wind, and may be up to 6 m high and 40 m wide.
(ii) A landform produced in a region of limestone or sandstone by infrequent rains combined
with wind action, and characterized by \"a surface bristling with a fine lacework of sharp
ridges pitted by corrosion.\" Compare - pavement karst. GG
(1160) yardang trough.-A long, shallow, round-bottomed groove, furrow, trough, or corridor
excavated in the desert floor by wind abrasion, and separating two yardangs. Compare -
yardang. GG
(1161) zibar.-A small, low-relief sand dune that lacks discernible slip faces and commonly
occurs on sand sheets, in interdune areas, or in corridors between larger dunes. Zibar spacing
can range from 50 to 400 m with local relief of less than 10 m. Unlike coppice dunes, zibars
are not related to deposition around vegetation. Generally dominated by coarser sands.
Compare - dune, coppice dune. SW, GG, NL, and CW
