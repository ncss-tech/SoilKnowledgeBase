The 0.062 mm break is very close to the USDA’s 0.05 mm break between coarse silt and very fine sand (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). The 64 mm “geologic” break is relatively close to the USDA’s 75 mm break between coarse gravel and cobbles. (See the chart “Comparison of Particle Size Classes in Different Systems” in the “Profile / Pedon Description Section” under “Soil Texture” in the Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils (Schoeneberger et al., 2012).) 2 A minimum size limit of 2 mm is required for volcanic fragments (i.e., rock and pararock) in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999), but is not required in geologic usage (Fisher, 1989). Soil Taxonomy also defines the term “pumicelike fragments” for vesicular pyroclastic materials other than pumice that have an apparent specific gravity (including vesicles) of less than 1.0 g/cm3 . 3 The general descriptor for pumiceous pyroclasts smaller than 2 mm. Geologic usage is based solely upon composition and does not include any size restrictions. REFERENCES Fisher, R.V. 1989. Pyroclastic sediments and rocks. AGI Data Sheet 25.2. In: J.T. Dutro, R.V.
