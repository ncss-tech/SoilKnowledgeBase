1/ Based on data in the publication \"Underground Corrosion,\" table 99, p.167, Circular 579, U.S. Department of
Commerce, National Bureau of Standards.
2/ The depth classes for internal free water occurrence are defined in table 3-5 of the Soil Survey Manual (1993). The
classes relate to the wet water state in soils (i.e., free water present). The general texture groups are defined in chapter 3
of the Soil Survey Manual.
3/ Based on data in Moore and Hallmark (1987), \"Soil Properties Influencing Corrosion of Steel in Texas Soils\", Soil
Sci. Soc. Am. J. 51:1250-1256.
4/ Total acidity is roughly equal to extractable acidity. Extractable acidity is determined by method 4B2a1a1, as outlined
in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 4.0, November 2004.
5/ Electrical conductivity is measured using method 4F2, as outlined in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Soil
Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 4.0, November 2004. The relationship between resistivity of a saturated
soil paste and electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is influenced by variations in the saturation percentage,
salinity, and conductivity of the soil minerals. These two measurements generally correspond closely enough to place a
soil in one risk of corrosion potential class.
6/ Soils that remain saturated for extended periods are excluded from the high risk of corrosion potential class unless EC values
are more than 10 dS m-1 (Moore and Hallmark, 1987). In the NASIS steel corrosion calculation, saturation for extended periods
is defined as having very shallow internal free water occurrence for 12 months.
7/ Resistivity at saturation is roughly equivalent to resistivity of fine and medium textured soils measured at saturation
(Method 4F2b2 as outlined in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version
4.0, November 2004). Resistivity at saturation for coarse textured soils is generally lower than that obtained at field capacity
and may cause the soil to be placed in a higher risk of corrosion potential class.

618.86 Estimating LL and PI from Percent and Type of Clay
The following two formulas provide estimates of liquid limit and plasticity index. These calculations
are included in the NASIS database and provide default values to LL and PI.
LL = 11.60 + [1.49 \u00d7 15 bar water %] + [1.35 \u00d7 org. carbon %] + [0.6 \u00d7 LEP] + [0.26 \u00d7 noncarbonate
clay %]*
where LL is liquid limit and LEP is linear extensibility percent
PI = -1.86 + [0.69 \u00d7 15 bar water %] - [1.19 \u00d7 organic carbon %] +[ 0.13 \u00d7 LEP] +[0.47 \u00d7
noncarbonate clay %]*
where PI is plasticity index and LEP is linear extensibility percent
* When the calculated PI < 0.5, the PI is set to zero (nonplastic). When the calculated LL < 15 or PI
< 0.5, the LL is set to zero.

618.88 Guide for Estimating Ksat from Soil Properties
Estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat ) from soil texture by first selecting the bulk density
class of medium, low, or high. Then use the corresponding texture triangle to select the range of
saturated hydraulic conductivity in \u00b5ms-1. Overrides follow the texture triangles.
If overriding conditions (listed below) exist, use this table to estimate Ksat instead of the texture
triangles. A single property statement is sufficient for an override from the texture guides.

618.89 Guide to Estimating Water Movement Through Bedrock for Layers
Designated as R and Cr
This table is to be used as a guide and may be adjusted to reflect local, regional, or State bedrock
permeability data1, 2. Fracturing may increase hydraulic conductivity of consolidated rock by a
factor of 104 to 106, which is dependent on the degree and interconnection of fracturing. This table
assumes that materials are level bedded. Tilted beds of some materials may have rapid rates of water
movement for water that goes directly to an aquifer.

618.90 Rock Fragment Modifier of Texture
Instructions for Table 1, Guide for determining rock fragment modifier of texture: First choose
the row with the appropriate total rock fragments. Then read the criteria in the columns under \"Gravel,
cobbles, stones, and boulders,\" starting from the left-most column and proceeding to the right. Stop in
the first column in which a criterion is met.

(Click  here for an MS Excel spreadsheet that calculates the texture modifiers for flat and nonflat
rock fragments.).

Example: Determine the rock fragment modifier for a soil that contains 15 percent gravel (GR), 10
percent cobbles (CB), and 3 percent stones (ST).
1. Since total rock fragments are 28 percent, choose the first row (\u2265 15 and < 35).
2. Under \"Gravel (GR), cobbles, . . .\", test the criterion in the left-most column.
Is 15%GR \u2265 1.5 (10% CB) + 2 (3% ST)? Answer: NO.
3. Proceed to the next column.
Is 10%CB \u2265 1.5 (3% ST)? Answer: YES. STOP. The modifier is Cobbly.

If both flat and nonflat rock fragments are present, the quantity in each size class is summed (e.g.,
gravel + channers, cobbles + flagstones). The sums are used to determine the appropriate quantity/size
modifier. If the amounts of flat and nonflat rock fragments within any given size class are equal, the
nonflat modifier takes precedence. For example, if there are 10 percent gravel and 10 percent
channers, the modifier is gravelly.
Soils With Pararock Fragments Only.-The same basic weighting rules apply with pararock
fragments as with flat and nonflat rock fragments. However, the above spreadsheet only outputs
modifier terms for rock fragments. To assign the correct pararock fragment modifier to the outputted
rock modifier term, simply precede the modifier with \"para.\" For example, if the calculator outputs
\"very cobbly,\" the correct modifier is \"very paracobbly.\"
Soils With Both Rock and Pararock Fragments.-Refer to instructions in section
618.67H(2)(vii) of this handbook.

1/ Mulch factor is the ratio of the soil loss from soils with the specified fragment volumes to that from soils with no fragments.
The table was constructed from the zero canopy curve, figure 6, page 19 in Agriculture Handbook 537 (USDA Science and
Education Administration, 1978).
618.93 General Guidelines for Assigning Soil Loss Tolerance \"T\"
Soil loss tolerance \"T\" is assigned according to properties of root and plant growth limiting
subsurface soil layers. The designation of a limiting layer implies that the material above the layer
has more favorable plant growth properties. As limiting or less favorable soil layers become closer
to the soil surface, the relative ability of a soil to maintain its productivity through natural and
managed processes decreases.
Caution should be used in comparing T factors across soils for soil quality or productivity. For
examples, soils with a T factor of 5 may not be the most productive and soils with the same T factor
rating may not be equally productive. For example, a soil that has a T factor of 5 and is sandy
throughout is not as naturally fertile nor can it hold as much available water as a soil that has a T factor
of 5 that is loamy throughout.
The criteria for assigning T factor are estimated from both of the following:
1.   The severity of physical or chemical properties of subsurface layers
2.   The economic feasibility of utilizing management practices to overcome limiting layers or
conditions
The following general guide was used with specific soil properties and conditions to write
criteria statements for programming T factors as a calculation in NASIS.

* Some soils are assigned a soil loss tolerance of 2.
Group 1.-The limitations are significant or there are permanent layers of root limitation
(nonrenewable).
Group 2.-The limitations for roots are moderate, or there is a less than permanent loss to
productivity (renewable).
Group 3.-The limitations can be overcome through natural or managed processes, and the
productivity level of the noneroded soil can be achieved (very renewable).
All restrictions in the NASIS \"Component Restrictions Table\" are considered root-limiting,
either physically or chemically.
T factors are assigned based on the criteria presented below. If there is more than one limiting soil
characteristic, then the soil is rated based on the most limiting soil characteristic based on the \"T\"
criteria in the table.

1/ Subaqueous soils (i.e., soils classified in Wassents or Wassists suborders) are excluded from assignment of T factors.
2/ Severely eroded soils, as designated by a the local phase or erosion class of 3 or 4, are adjusted one class of T factor lower.
3/ Determines the line between the 30% clay and 70% sand point and the 0% clay and 50% sand point on the texture
triangle (see part 618, subpart B, section 618.87). If the total of the vcos, cos, ms, and fs sand separates and total clay (of
the adjacent layers above the sandy substratum) plot above this line on the texture triangle, then the uppers layers are
considered different from the sandy substratum textures. Thus, the sandy substratum is recognized and the T factor is
lowered.

pararock fragments at the surface and/or wetness;
and Folists.
The following footnotes are applied in the order listed:
1 For all WEGs except 1 and 2 (sands and loamy sand textures), if percent rock and pararock fragments
(>2mm) by volume is 15-35, reduce \"I\" value by one group with more favorable rating. If percent rock and
pararock fragments by volume is 35-60, reduce \"I\" value by two favorable groups except for sands and
loamy sand textures which are reduced by one group with more favorable rating. If percent rock and
pararock fragments is greater than 60, use \"I\" value of 0 for all textures except sands and loamy sand
textures which are reduced by three groups with more favorable ratings. An example of more favorable \"I\"
rating is next lower number: \"I\" factor of 160 to \"I\" factor of 134 or \"I\" factor of 86 to \"I\" factor of 56. The
index values should correspond exactly to their wind erodibility group (e.g., \"I\" factor of 56 = WEG 5).
2 The \"I\" values for WEG 1 vary from 160 for coarse sands to 310 for very fine sands. Use an \"I\" of 220 as
an average figure.
3 All material that meets criterion 3 in the required characteristics for andic soil properties as defined in the
Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th edition. Such material is placed in WEG 2 regardless of the texture class of the
fine-earth fraction.
4 All material that meets criterion 2, but not criterion 3, in the required characteristics for andic soil
properties as defined in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th edition. Such material is placed in WEG 6,
regardless of the texture class of the fine-earth fraction. The only exception to this is for Cryic Spodosols
which have a medial substitute class and a MAAT < 4 degrees C.; these soils are placed in WEG 2.
5 For surface layers or horizons that do not meet the required characteristics for andic soil properties but do
meet Vitrandic, Vitritorrandic, Vitrixerandic, and Ustivitrandic subgroup criteria (thickness criterion excluded)
move one wind erodibility group (WEG) with a less favorable rating.
6 Calcareous is a strongly or violently effervescent reaction (class) of the fine-earth fraction to cold dilute
(1N) HCL; a paper \"Computing the Wind Erodible Fraction of Soils\" by D. W. Fryear et.al (1994) in the
Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 49 (2) 183-188 raises a yet unresolved question regarding the effect
of carbonates on wind erosion.
7 For mineral soils with thin \"O\" horizons, the WEG is based on the first mineral horizon.

618.98 NASIS Calculation for Estimating AASHTO Group Index
Definition.-Computes the AASHTO Group Index for a horizon
Inputs.-This calculation requires the following data to be populated:
number 200 sieve
liquid limit
plasticity index
Calculation.
DEFINE skip_ll         ANY (aashto_class == \"a-2-6\" or aashto_class == \"a-2-7\").
DEFINE aashind         .01*(sieveno200_r-15)*(pi_r-10).
ASSIGN aashind IF skip_ll OR (sieveno200_r<35 and pi_r>=10) THEN aashind ELSE (sieveno200_r
- 35)*(.2 + .005*(ll_r - 40)) + aashind.
ASSIGN aashind         IF pi_r==0 OR (aashind<0 AND NOT ISNULL(aashind)) THEN 0 ELSE aashind.
618.99 NASIS Calculation for Estimating Cation-Exchange Capacity
Definition.-If the rv pH (in water) is greater than or equal to 5.5, then CEC is calculated; if the rv pH is
less than 5.5, then ECEC is calculated for a horizon.
Caution: Estimates of CEC or ECEC for soil layers with andic soil properties may be unreliable. Read
the documentation to this calculation to see if it will work for your soils.
Inputs.-This calculation requires the following data to be populated:
organic matter (high, low, and rv)
pH in water (high, low, and rv)
pH in CaCl (for organic layers) (high, low, and rv)
total clay (high, low, and rv)
carbonate clay (high, low, and rv)
total silt (high, low, and rv)
CaCO3 (high, low, and rv) used only for soils containing gypsum
gypsum (high, low, and rv) used only for soils containing gypsum
taxonomic family mineralogy
taxonomic order
taxonomic CEC-activity class
1) The calculation is based on Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). The CEC or ECEC is
calculated based on the family mineralogy/CEC-activity class first. If an equation does not exist
for a mineralogy/CEC-activity class, then the CEC/ECEC is based on the soil order.
2) If the family mineralogy class, CEC-activity class (if appropriate), and soil order are not
populated, a null is returned.
3) If there is more than one family mineralogy class populated in the \"Component-Taxonomic-
Family-Mineralogy Table,\" the first one is used.
4) If the pH in water is not populated, then pH in CaCl is used. If the pH (CaCl) is greater than or
equal to 5.1, then CEC is calculated; otherwise ECEC is calculated for a horizon.
5) If any required data element (OM, pH, clay, silt) for an equation is not populated (null entry), a
null is returned, except for carbonate clay.
6) If carbonate clay is null, zero carbonate clay is assumed.
7) Noncarbonate clay is calculated by subtracting percent carbonate clay from total clay
(noncarbonated clay = total_clay - carbonate_clay).
8) Percent organic matter is converted to percent organic C by dividing by 1.72 (OC = OM/1.72).
9) If only low and high values are populated for a data element, an rv is calculated by taking the
average of the low and high values.
10) In the calculation of CEC for isotic and amorphic mineralogies and Andisols and for isotic
mineralogy for ECEC, gravimetric 15-bar water is used. An internal calculation calculates the
15-bar water using the following formula:
15-bar water = [total_clay (1 - organic_matter / 100) 0.4 + organic_matter]
11) In the calculation of ECEC, if the mineralogy class is not parasesquic, smectitic, or isotic and is
not mixed or siliceous with a CEC activity class and the soil order is Andisols, Gelisols,
Aridisols, or Vertisols, then no ECEC is calculated (null is returned).
Calculation.
