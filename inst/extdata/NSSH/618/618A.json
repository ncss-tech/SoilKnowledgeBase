An alternative means of measuring is to visually estimate the volume of the 20 to 75 mm fraction, then sieve and weigh the 2 to 20 mm fraction. The fraction 75 mm (3 inches) or greater is usually not included in soil samples taken in the field for laboratory testing. Measurements can be made in the field by weighing the dry sample and the portion retained on a 3-inch screen. The smallest dimension of discrete artifacts is used to determine whether these items pass through a sieve. The quantity is expressed as a weight percentage of the total soil. A sample as large as 200 pounds to more than a ton may be needed to assure that the results are representative. Measurements of the fraction from 75 to 250 mm (3 to 10 inches) and the fraction greater than 250 mm (10 inches) in diameter are usually obtained from volume estimates.",

Soils that have a low cation-exchange capacity hold fewer cations and may require more frequent applications of fertilizer than soils that have a high cation- exchange capacity. Soils that have a high cation-exchange capacity have the potential to retain cations, which reduces the risk of the pollution of ground water. Cation-exchange capacity is used indirectly in soil classification, when recalculated for just the noncarbonate clay fraction, in the required characteristics for kandic and oxic horizons and as a criterion for specific subgroup taxa in Alfisols (e.g., Kandic Paleustalfs), Entisols, Inceptisols, and Mollisols. Cation-exchange capacity is also used in calculating the ratio of cation-exchange capacity to percent noncarbonate clay for classifying certain soils at the family level into cation-exchange activity classes. The latest edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy has more information on applying this ratio in classification.",

(i) Soil reaction (pH) correlates poorly with corrosion potential; however, a pH of 4.0 or less almost always indicates a high corrosion potential. (ii) Ratings, which are based on a single soil property or quality, that place soils in relative classes for corrosion potential must be tempered by knowledge of other properties and qualities that affect corrosion. A study of soil properties in relation to local experiences with corrosion helps soil scientists and engineers to make soil interpretations. Special attention must be given to those soil properties that affect the access of oxygen and moisture to the metal, the electrolyte, the chemical reaction in the electrolyte, and the flow of current through the electrolyte. Special attention must be given to the presence of sulfides or of minerals, such as pyrite, that can be weathered readily and thus cause ahigh degree of corrosion in metals. (iii) The possibility of corrosion is greater for extensive installations that intersect soil boundaries or soil horizons than for installations that are in one kind of soil or in one soil horizon. (iv) Using interpretations for corrosion without considering the size of the metallic structure or the differential effects of using different metals may lead to wrong conclusions.

As a result, the CEC of these soils is not a fixed number but is a function of pH.

Estimates of the percent of cobbles and boulders are presented in the soil descriptions for a group name (see ASTM Designation D 2487, Appendix X1.1). A small amount of these larger particles generally has little effect on soil properties. The particles may, however, have an effect on the use of a soil in certain types of construction. Often, the larger portions of a soil must be removed before the material can be spread in thin layers, graded, or compacted and graded to a smooth surface. As the quantity of this “oversized” fraction increases, the properties of the soil can be affected. If the larger particles are in contact with each other, the strength of the soil is very high and the compressibility very low. If voids exist between the larger particles, the soil will likely have high saturated hydraulic conductivity and may undergo some internal erosion as a result of the movement of water through the voids.

Soils that have a high content of silt and very fine sand have this capacity to the greatest degree and hence have the highest potential for ice segregation. Clayey soils hold large quantities of water but have such slow saturated hydraulic conductivity that segregated ice lenses are not formed unless the freezing front is slow moving. However, sandy soils have large pores and hold less water under lower tension.

For example, a horizon sequence of Bt1- Bt2-Bt3, based solely on color variation and having no other significant differences, may be combined and shown simply as Bt. Master horizon subdivisions showing genetic variations that are deemed significant to interpretations should not be combined. For example, a horizon sequence of Bt-Btx-BC should not be combined.

(ii) The kind and amount of clay influence plant growth indirectly by affecting available water capacity, water intake rate, aeration, cation-exchange capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, erodibility, and workability. Up to a certain point, an increase in the amount of clay in the subsoil is desirable. Clay can increase the amount of water and nutrients stored in that zone. By slightly slowing the rate of water movement, it can reduce the rate of nutrient loss through leaching. If the amount of clay is great, it can impede water and air movement, restrict root penetration, increase runoff, and, on sloping land, result in increased erosion.

Pararock fragments are assumed to break down with cultivation or other manipulation and so are not used in determining Kw factors. If a soil has mixtures of rock and pararock fragments, the Kw factor should reflect the degree of protection afforded only by the rock fragments. Guidelines for determining Kw factors are as follows: (i) First, use the soil erodibility nomograph shown in part 618, subpart B, section 618.91, or the soil erodibility equation shown above to determine the Kf factor for the soil material less than 2 mm in diameter. (ii) Then use the table in part 618, subpart B, section 618.92, to convert the Kf value of the soil fraction less than 2 mm in diameter, which is derived from either the nomograph in part 618, subpart B, section 618.91, or from the soil erodibility equation, to a Kw factor adjusted for the total volume of rock fragments. The Kw factor is adjusted only when the total content of rock fragment values in the layer, by volume, is equal to or greater than 15 percent. If total rock fragment content, by volume, is less than 15 percent, the Kw factor equals the Kf factor. In practice, the representative values (RVs) for rock fragment volume, as populated in the NASIS “Horizon Fragments” table, are summed for each size fraction to compute the total rock fragment content for the layer. (iii) If the soil on site contains more or less rock fragments than the mean of the range reported, adjustments can be made in Kf by using part 618, subpart B, section 618.92. Select the estimates of total rock fragment volume percentages, then use part 618, subpart B, section 618.92. In part 618, subpart B, section 618.92, go to the line with the rock fragment volume percentage and find, in the appropriate line, the nearest value to the Kf factor. Within that column, read the Kw factor on the line with the percentage of rock fragments of the soil for which you are making the estimate. Round the K factor displayed in the table to the closest acceptable K factor class entry, as shown below. This is the new Kw factor adjusted for rock fragments on site.",

It is the susceptibility of the soil to movement to a rill carrying runoff. (ii) Significance.—Interrill erodibility (Ki) is a measure of sediment delivery rate to rills as a function of rainfall intensity. The Ki values for soil need to be adjusted if factors that influence the resistance of soil to detachment occur. These factors include live and dead root biomass, soil freezing and thawing, and mechanical and livestock compaction.

As rill erodibility (Kr) increases, rill erosion rates increase. (ii) Significance.—Rill erodibility (Kr) is often defined as the soil detachment per unit increase in shear stress of clear water flow. The rate of soil detachment in rills varies because of a number of factors, including soil disturbance by tillage, living root biomass, incorporated residue, fragments, soil consolidation, freezing and thawing, and wheel and livestock compaction.

Soil texture has a strong influence on soil mechanics and the behavior of soil when it is used as construction or foundation material. It influences such engineering properties as bearing strength, compressibility, saturated hydraulic conductivity, shrink-swell potential, and compaction. Engineers are also particularly interested in rock and pararock fragments. Soil texture influences plant growth by its affect on aeration, the water intake rate, the available water capacity, the cation-exchange capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, erodibility, and workability. Changes in texture as related to depth are indicators of how soils formed. When texture is plotted with depth, smooth curves indicate translocation and accumulation. Irregular changes in particle-size distribution, especially in the sand fraction, may indicate lithologic discontinuities, specifically differences in parent material. Soil texture is used for soil classification in criteria for certain taxa such as the Psamments suborder, “Psamm” great groups, and Arenic, Grossarenic, and Psammentic subgroups. Soil texture is also used in the family category of Soil Taxonomy for differentiae such as particle-size class.",

Of the remaining material smaller than 2 mm, the amount of the various sizes of sand is determined by sieving. The amount of silt and clay is determined by a differential rate of settling in water. Either the pipette or hydrometer method is used for the silt and clay analysis. Organic matter and dissolved mineral matter are removed in the pipette procedure but not in the hydrometer procedure. The two procedures are generally very similar, but a few samples, especially those with high organic matter or high soluble salts, exhibit wide discrepancies.

These terms are used to describe folistic epipedons (i.e., in mineral soils only) or organic horizons of any thickness (i.e., in organic or mineral soils) provided they meet the saturation requirements. The terms “muck,” “mucky peat,” and “peat” (codes MUCK, MPT, and PEAT) are used to describe histic epipedons (i.e., in mineral soils only) and organic horizons of any thickness (i.e., in organic or mineral soils) that are saturated with water for 30 or more cumulative days in normal years or are artificially drained. (ii) For soil materials with 40 percent or more, by weight, gypsum in the fine-earth fraction, gypsum dominates the physical and chemical properties of the soil and particle-size classes are not meaningful. Two terms in lieu of texture are used. “Coarse gypsum material” (code CGM) is used for these materials where 50 percent or more of the fine-earth fraction is comprised of particles ranging from ≥0.1 to <2.0 mm in diameter. “Fine gypsum material” (code FGM) is applied to materials where less than 50 percent of the fine-earth fraction is comprised of particles ranging from ≥0.1 to <2.0 mm in diameter. (iii) The term “material” (code MAT) is generic and requires the use of a texture modifier. It is intended for cemented diagnostic horizons, such as duripans, petrocalcic horizons, and petrogypsic horizons (coded CEM-MAT), by using the texture modifier “cemented” with the term in lieu of texture “material.” The concatenated texture term for such horizons in pedon descriptions is “cemented material.” In the past, texture modifier terms, such as “coprogenous,” “gypsiferous,” and “marly,” were used to describe material, but such use has been discontinued and is no longer permitted.

      "content": "(2) Application.—Texture modifier terms may apply to both texture and terms used in lieu of texture. Some may apply to both, others only apply to one or the other. Combinations of some texture modifiers are allowed. A list of allowable texture modifier terms and their codes is given in part 618, subpart B, section 618.94. Some rules of application are given below. (i) If the content of fragments equals 15 percent or more, by volume, texture modifiers are used. An example is gravelly loam or parachannery loam. The adjectives “very” and “extremely” are used when the content of fragments equals 35 to less than 60 percent and 60 to less than 90 percent, by volume, respectively. (ii) Texture modifiers, such as paragravelly and paracobbly, are used to identify the presence of pararock fragments. The size, shape, and amounts of pararock fragments required for these terms are the same as for rock fragments. (iii) “Mucky” and “peaty” are used to modify near-surface horizons of mineral soils that are saturated with water for 30 or more cumulative days in normal years or are artificially drained. An example is mucky loam. Excluding live roots, the horizon has organic carbon content (by weight) of one of the following: • If the mineral fraction contains no clay, 5 to < 12 percent • If the mineral fraction contains 60 percent or more clay, 12 to < 18 percent • If the mineral fraction contains less than 60 percent clay, [5 + (clay percentage multiplied by 0.12)] to < [12 + (clay percentage multiplied by 0.10)] (iv) “Highly organic” is used to modify near-surface horizons of mineral soils that are saturated with water for less than 30 cumulative days in normal years and are not artificially drained. Excluding live roots, the horizon has an organic carbon content (by weight) of one of the following: • If the mineral fraction contains no clay, 5 to < 20 percent • If the mineral fraction contains 60 percent or more clay, 12 to < 20 percent • If the mineral fraction contains less than 60 percent clay, [5 + (clay percentage multiplied by 0.12)] to < 20 percent (v) Shell fragments can be recognized in subaqueous or subaerial soils. In this context, “shell” is a hard, protective outer layer created by invertebrate organisms in marine and freshwater environments and is composed primarily of calcium carbonate materials of Holocene age. Examples include oyster shells, hard and soft shell clams, scallops, snails (including terrestrial), mussel, and hard coral. Shell fragments greater than or equal to 2 mm in size are included in measurement. Rock fragment classes are to be used in addition to the shell fragment classes where appropriate, similar to the artifactual classes of anthropogenic soils. (vi) Compound texture modifiers may be used. For example, a term may be used to indicate the presence of fragments and another used to indicate some nonfragment condition. The term used to indicate rock fragments should be listed first. Examples are very gravelly mucky silt loam and paragravelly ashy loam; very flaggy-artifactual loam; or gravelly-shelly silt loam. (vii) In some cases, mineral soil may contain a combination of both artifacts and fragments in the soil such as rock fragments and pararock fragments. In all cases, the artifacts, rock fragments, and pararock fragments are each described separately. The assignment of texture modifiers for such horizons is handled differently depending on the nature of the artifacts. Artifacts in soils which are discrete (i.e., ≥ 2 mm), cohesive, and persistent (e.g., concrete) function in a manner which is similar to rock fragments. Artifacts which are either noncohesive or nonpersistent (e.g., cardboard) behave differently than other discrete artifacts and also rock fragments. When describing the texture of soil horizons with artifacts or a combination of artifacts and fragments, the following rules of application are followed: • Describe the individual kinds and amounts (percent by volume) of artifacts and any fragments, if present. Record all pertinent attributes for artifacts (see section 618.5), paying particular attention to data on artifact cohesion and persistence. • If the combined volume of artifacts, which are both cohesive and persistent, plus any rock fragments present is less than 15 percent, use the table below: Less than 15 percent No artifact texture modifier is used. 15 to < 35 percent The adjectival term “artifactual” is used as a modifier of the texture class, suchas \"artifactual loam.” 35 to < 60 percent The adjectival term “very artifactual”is used as a modifier of the texture class, suchas “very artifactual loam.” 60 to < 90 percent The adjectival term “extremelyartifactual”is used as a modifier of the texture class, suchas “extremely artifactual loam.” 90 percent or more No texture modifierterms are used. If there is too little fine earth to determine the texture class (less thanabout 10 percent, by volume) the term used in lieuof texture, “artifacts,”is populated. • If both artifacts and rock fragments are present and the combined volume of rock fragments and artifacts, which are both cohesive and persistent, is 15 percent or more, assign dual rock fragment-artifact texture modifiers. Dual rock fragment-artifact texture modifiers are based on the combined volume of both. The modifiers are concatenated terms joined with a hyphen. For example, use “gravelly-artifactual loam” as the texture modifier for a horizon with a fine- earth texture class of loam that contains 10 percent quartzite gravel, 3 percent brick (a cohesive and persistent artifact), 2 percent glass (a cohesive and persistent artifact), and 25 percent plasterboard (a noncohesive artifact). See part 618, subpart B, section 618.94, for the list of 18 dual rock fragment-artifact texture modifiers. • If artifacts, pararock fragments, and rock fragments are present, but the combined volume of artifacts, which are both cohesive and persistent, and any rock fragments present is less than 15 percent, compound texture modifiers are used. The compound texture modifiers connote only the artifacts and the pararock fragments. The modifier for artifacts is assigned (using the table shown above) preceding the texture modifier for pararock fragments. Some examples are “artifactual paracobbly coarse sandy loam” for a horizon that contains 20 percent rubber (e.g., shredded tires) and 20 percent granite paracobbles and “very artifactual parachannery clay” for a horizon with 40 percent carpet pieces and 20 percent siltstone parachanners. In NASIS, the compound texture modifier is built using an artifact and pararock fragment modifier selected from the choice list. (vii) If a horizon includes both rock fragments and pararock fragments, use the following rules for selecting texture modifiers: • Describe the individual kinds and amounts of rock fragments and pararock fragments. • Do not use a fragment texture modifier when the combined volume of rock fragments and pararock fragments is less than 15 percent. • When the combined volume of rock fragments and pararock fragments is 15 percent or more and the volume of rock fragments is less than 15 percent, assign pararock fragment modifiers based on the combined volume of fragments. For example, use “paragravelly” as a texture modifier for soils with 10 percent rock and 10 percent pararock gravel-sized fragments. • When the volume of rock fragments is 15 percent or more, use the appropriate texture modifier for rock fragments (see part 618, subpart B, section 618.90), regardless of the volume of pararock fragments. (Do not add the volume of rock and pararock fragments to determine the texture modifier.) (viii) The definitions of the following four compositional texture modifiers guide their usage. Examples are “hydrous clay,” “medial silt loam,” “ashy loam,” and “gypsiferous fine sandy loam.” • Hydrous.—Material that has andic soil properties and an undried 15 bar (1500 kPa) water content of 100 percent or more of the dry weight. • Medial.—Material that has andic soil properties and has a 15 bar (1500 kPa) water content of less than 100 percent on undried samples and of 12 percent or more on air-dried samples. • Ashy.—Material that has andic soil properties and is neither hydrous nor medial or material that does not have andic soil properties and the fine-earth fraction contains 30 percent or more particles ≥0.02 to <2.0 mm in diameter, of which 5 percent or more is composed of volcanic glass and the [(aluminum plus 1/2 iron percent by ammonium oxalate) times 60] plus the volcanic glass percent is equal to or more than 30. • Gypsiferous.—Material that contains 15 to < 40 percent, by weight, gypsum. (ix) Woody, grassy, mossy, and herbaceous texture modifiers are only used to modify muck, peat, or mucky peat terms (used for histic epipedons and organic horizons of any thickness that are saturated with water for 30 or more cumulative days in normal years, or are artificially drained, including those in Histels and Histosols, except for Folists). The definitions of the following four compositional texture modifiers guide their usage: • Woody.—Any material that contains 15 percent or more wood fragments ≥2 cm in size or organic soil materials, other than SPM, MPM, or HPM, that contain 15 percent or more fibers that can be identified as wood origin and contain more wood fibers than any other kind of fiber. • Grassy.—Organic soil material that contains more than 15 percent fibers that can be identified as grass, sedges, cattails, and other grasslike plants and contains more grassy fibers than any other kind of fiber. • Mossy.—Organic soil material that contains more than 15 percent fibers that can be identified as moss and contains more moss fibers than any other kind of fiber. • Herbaceous.—Organic soil material that contains more than 15 percent fibers that can be identified as herbaceous plants other than moss and grass or grasslike plants and more of these fibers than any other kind of fiber. (x) In rare instances, some soil materials can be described by using a texture modifier, even though they do not fit the requirements of texture. An example is “gypsiferous material.” (xi) Limnic materials have modifiers to texture to connote the origin of the material. The three kinds of limnic materials are coprogenous earth, diatomaceous earth, and marl. These materials were deposited in water by precipitation or through the action of aquatic organisms or derived from plants and organisms. Refer to the Keys to Soil Taxonomy for the complete definitions and taxonomic criteria of limnic materials. The following three compositional texture modifiers are used with limnic materials to indicate presence and origin without respect to any set quantity of pellets, grains, or particles. Examples are “coprogenous silty clay loam,” “diatomaceous very fine sandy loam,” and “marly silt loam.” • Coprogenous.—Soil material that is a limnic layer containing many very small (0.1 to 0.001 mm) fecal pellets. • Diatomaceous.—Soil material that is a limnic layer composed of diatoms. • Marly.—Soil material that is a limnic layer that is light colored and reacts with HCl to evolve CO2. (xii) “Permanently frozen” is a texture modifier term applied to a soil layer in which the temperature is perennially at or below 0 degrees C, whether its consistence is very hard or loose.",
