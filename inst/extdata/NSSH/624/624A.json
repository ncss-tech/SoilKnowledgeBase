The inherent quality of soils is often used to compare the capabilities of one soil against another and to evaluate the worth or suitability of soils for specific uses. For example, given all other determining properties being equal, a loam soil will have a higher water holding capacity than a sandy soil. Thus, the loam soil will have a higher inherent quality for storing water and lower inherent quality for producing a freely drained condition.",

The reference condition is often based on use-invariant properties in conjunction with the dynamic properties. Soil properties are used to group soils that function similarly. Reference values are developed for the key properties of soils that reflect the capacity of the soil to function. Evaluation of soil quality or health must be tied to soil functions and the specific use of the soil. Soil health can also be evaluated by establishing a baseline condition for the use-dependent properties (indicators).
