Their purpose is to focus data collection and the investigative effort on soils that have the greatest potential for extending collected data and resultant interpretations to other soils. This purpose is relevant both in making soil surveys and to soil survey customers in their goal to extend findings of their research. The cost of investigation and the large number of combinations of soil uses and management practices preclude laboratory and field studies of all soils; therefore, studies of benchmark soils are an essential component of developing nationwide soil databases and soil interpretations. Data obtained by studying benchmark soils can be used to help estimate important properties in similar soils. Benchmark soils can also be used to test new interpretations or to provide input to regional scale models. Knowledge of the properties and behavior of benchmark soils contributes to the understanding and interpretation of other soils with similar properties. This knowledge is important to soil technology and the use of soil surveys.",

    {
      "clause": 2,
      "content": "A. Criteria The soil series that are designated as benchmark soils within an MLRA should collectively reflect the major diversity of soils within the area. The criteria are as follows: (i) Extent.—The soil series that are selected as benchmark soils are commonly of large extent (>100,000 acres) in the land resource region (LRR), and of moderate or large extent (> 10,000 acres) in the MLRA. Not all series of moderate or large extent are benchmark soils. Generally, the combined total extent of all benchmark soils should comprise about 20 to 25 percent of the total soil area of the major land resource area. When combining the extent of the benchmark soils plus the extent of similar soils that they represent, collectively they are representative of 60 to 80 percent or more of all soils in the major land resource area. This kind of representation ensures that any collected data are widely applicable. (ii) Key Taxonomic Classes.—Soils that are representative of key positions in soil taxonomy within the MLRA (such as commonly occurring great groups, subgroups, or families) are considered for benchmark soil designation. Research on these can be easily applied to other soils in those classes. Typically, no more than one or two soils from the same family are designated as benchmark soils within an MLRA. See paragraph (iv) below for a reason to have more than one. (iii) Existing Data.—When similar soils are potential candidates for benchmark soil designation, soil series for which there are adequate amounts of data have preference over equally suitable series for which there are less data. Data-completeness of correlated pedon data must be evaluated concurrently with analyses of series extent, taxonomic significance, or unique importance. The National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) soil characterization database (http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov), maintained by the National Soil Survey Center, includes laboratory data for benchmark soils. In addition, soil survey investigations reports identify benchmark soils. This will optimize the identification of potential benchmark candidates. Benchmark soils need to be well documented with complete characterization data. Ideally, there should be three to five pedons characterized. Each description must be accurately georeferenced. The data should include physical characterization (e.g., particle size, bulk density, moisture characteristics, Atterberg limits, etc.), chemical characterization (e.g., pH, base status, CEC, organic carbon, and calcium carbonate equivalent as applicable, etc.), and mineralogical characterization (e.g., clay minerals, optical grain counts). Additional data, such as cations extracted by ammonium oxalate, cations extracted by dithionite citrate, electrical conductivity, COLE, phosphate retention, exchangeable sodium percentage, melanic index, and other properties, are important for some soils and should be considered when evaluating the completeness of existing data. Since there is not a single list of appropriate data for every soil, the assigned liaison from the NSSC Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, and where applicable, the local university NCSS cooperator, should be consulted to evaluate the adequacy of the existing data, identify data needs, and develop plans to expand the data available for benchmark soils in the region. (iv) Other Considerations.—The set of benchmark soils for a MLRA should include representatives from the major parent materials and landforms in the area. For example, coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs may be common on both extensive till plains and stream terraces in the MLRA. A single series from this family might not be adequate to represent these conditions if some key properties are significantly different between the two settings. Certain soils are especially important because of their use or ecological importance in the landscape. If these soils are essential to the understanding of landscape processes or ecological functions within the MLRA, or interpretations for unique land uses or land management practices, they may be designated as benchmark soils, even if they are not extensive. The number of soils meeting this criterion alone is small, perhaps two or three per MLRA.",
