610.10 Agency Resources Concerns
Project Concern Type Name Project Concern Description
Air Quality Particulate matter less than 2.5 and/or 10 micrometers in diameter is
suspended in the air, causing potential health hazards to humans and
animals.
Fish and/or Wildlife Habitat has insufficient structure, extent, and connectivity to provide
ecological functions and/or achieve management objectives.
Land Use Implementing the conservation practices may cause an increased change
from one land use to another.
Plant Condition Plants do not produce the yields, quality, and soil cover to meet client
objectives or do not have adequate nutritive value or palatability for the
intended use.
Soil Condition The capacity to limit redistribution and loss of soil resources (including
nutrients and organic matter) by wind and water.
Water Erosion Detachment and transport of soil particles caused by rainfall splash and
runoff degrade soil quality.
Water Quality Excessive nutrients and organics in surface water pollution from natural or
human-induced nutrients such as N, P, and S (including animal and other
wastes) degrades surface water quality.
Water Quantity The capacity to capture, store, and safely release water from rainfall, run-
on, and snowmelt (where relevant).
Wind Erosion Detachment and transport of soil particles caused by wind degrade soil
quality and/or damage plants.

610.13 Sample Project Evaluation Worksheet
This worksheet should be tailored for the MLRA soil survey area. An effective worksheet identifies key
items for evaluation and assists with an organized and consistent review of map units. The information
gathered on this worksheet should be used for the evaluation of each map unit, the evaluation of the taxa
used in the map unit name, and the evaluation of individual delineations of the map unit. This
information should be collected and analyzed and a summarized paragraph entered into the NASIS
database (see part 638 of this handbook) in the Mapunit Text table under the appropriate map unit(s).
All notes entered into the Mapunit Text table should be populated with Kind set to “miscellaneous
notes,” Category set to “evaluation notes,” and Subcategory set to “spatial,” “attribute,” or
“interpretation.” A variety of national NASIS reports named “MLRA – mgmt – XXX” can be used to
create the evaluation report.
Part A. Evaluation of the survey area
Summarize the information from the non-MLRA survey areas occurring within the update project:
How were the soil maps digitized?
What is the new base map for the update?
What is the new map scale?

What additional interpretations have users requested?
Briefly describe the investigative and laboratory support needed to provide the new data and
interpretations.
Briefly describe how this survey will be improved by the update.
Briefly describe any publication plans in addition to the Web Soil Survey.

Are soil property entries in the NASIS database complete?
Part C. Evaluation of the map unit components used to name the map unit (subcategory
“attribute”)
Is the proper component kind value entered for the component?
Does the component name and/or taxonomic classification need to be updated? If so, what is the
proposed new name or taxonomic classification?
Do miscellaneous area names correspond to the approved list of miscellaneous areas?
Are component names properly entered with only the component name and in title case (e.g.,
Jonus)?
Are phase criteria properly entered in the local phase column?
Can the soil component be classified as presently described? If no, why not?
Does the depth of the typifying pedon meet current needs?
Does the series (taxa), as described, overlap with other series (taxa)? If yes, how?
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-649-H, XX Ed., Amend. X, Month Year)
649-B.8
Does the typical pedon represent the map unit component?
Is there lab data for the series (taxa)? If yes, how many locations were tested and is the data
adequate?

Is there an exact join with surrounding surveys?
Is soil mapping consistently applied to landscapes across the major land resource area?
Does the use of features and symbols reflect current definitions and follow standards on the
Feature and Symbol Legend for Soil Survey, NRCS-SOI-37A?
Will this map unit require extensive revision (remapping)?
Part E. Evaluation of map unit interpretations (subcategory “interpretation”)

reconciled for the MLRA. Once
a decision on slope phase is
made, the interpretations should
be more uniform.

610.14 Project Plan Checklist
The Project Plan is a NASIS report that presents the data entered into the NASIS Project object. For
proposed projects, the following data fields in the Project table data are populated:
User Project Identification
Project Name
Project Description
MLRA Soil Survey Office
Project Map units
Project Land Category Breakdown
Project Concern Need
Milestone “Future Project”
Once approved, the remaining fields are then populated.
This exhibit provides a checklist of NASIS populated fields to be managed by the SSO.
User Project Identification: This column identifies the priority of the project and is populated based on
region guidance. An example is “2018-1,” which identifies the top priority for fiscal year (FY) 2018.
Project Name: The project name begins with the MLRA followed by a space, a dash, and another space,
map unit or landform indicator (e.g., MLRA 133B – Cahaba fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes;
MLRA 128 – Great Limestone Valley Summits).
Project Description
The project description discusses the key issues of project map units identified during the inventory and
assessment and describes specific work activities necessary to address those key issues. Time needed to
complete the project, where work will occur, expected outcome, and benefits gained from completing the
project are described. The project description provides mangers with appropriate information to review
and approve the project while providing project staff with information sufficient to carry out the project.
Section 610.16 shows examples of project descriptions. Including items in the project description that are
also populated elsewhere in project object may produce redundancy in the Project Plan. For example, the
Project Plan may extract project map units from the Project Map Unit table; therefore, consideration
should be given to how the map units, or components are described in the project description.
The project description is subdivided into two required sections. The first section is a single paragraph
summary while the second section expounds specific project details. Each section describes the what,
how, where, when, why, and who of the project.
First Section - Summary Paragraph
The first paragraph is an executive summary, or abstract, of the project. The primary audience
are managers, e.g., State Conservationists, State soil scientists, and soil survey regional directors.
The summary provides the managers with an overview to assist them in reviewing the project.
The paragraph is limited to 1,000 characters. The paragraph is written without headers, bulleted
items, or lists. See section 610.16 for examples. The summary paragraph discusses the following
six items:
1. What map units (or components) are being investigated AND what are the key issues.
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-649-H, XX Ed., Amend. X, Month Year)
649-B.11
2. Where will the project be focused or the areas impacted by the project. Identify
individual survey areas, specific landforms, geographic areas, States or sections of
States, or MLRAs or sections of MLRAs.
3. How will the issues be addressed or resolved, AND what is the expected outcome:
a. List field and/or office work necessary to address the issues listed in item 1,
b. Summarize how the current soil survey information will change.
4. When is the project timeframe and how many staff years to complete the project?
5. Who requested the project and/or is the main beneficiary?
6. Why is the project important by identifying the major resource concern to benefit from
project completion?
Second Section – Project Details
This section follows the executive summary (above) and begins with the major heading “Project
Details.” It should be as concise as possible while remaining informative enough to provide
current or future soil scientists with the information necessary to continue the project. The
primary target audience is the field soil scientist. Include background history only to the extent
necessary to guide the project leader. The following outline will be followed; however, the list is
not all inclusive and other issues can be included. A comment on the implemented update
strategy is interwoven into this section (see section 610.3(C)). The project details are organized
by: Objectives and Procedures, ‘Areas Included in the Project, Timeframe, Benefits, Outcome
and Deliverables, and Travel Budget.

610.16 Project Description Examples
Examples of Summary Opening Paragraphs
Example 1.
The northern portion of the Chehalis River flood plain is experiencing heavy urban development. This
development is causing land use concerns about the accuracy and consistency of the current soil lines and
water-related soil properties. This area occurs in MLRA 2 and includes portions of WA627, WA667, and
WA641. This 2-year project will result in updated order 2 tabular and spatial data for 41,861 acres.
Chehalis, Cloquato, and Newberg are the major soils that will be investigated. New map units will be
generated and line work will be recompiled to current imagery using LIDAR. Data will be updated,
including new field observations and KSSL samples; however, information from existing KSSL data,
archived manuscripts, original SSURGO data, and tacit knowledge will be reviewed and incorporated.
No ESD work will be included in this project.
Example 2.
The Jaucus series is mapped throughout the Hawaiian Islands of Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and Maui—on
beaches of all islands and on relatively upland soils in the isthmus valley of Maui on sugar cane lands
(MLRAs 158, 163, 164, 166, and 167). This series was established in the U.S. Virgin Islands;
documentation needs to be obtained to establish a new series to reflect Hawaiian Island characteristics.
Preliminary investigation of soil mapping in sugar cane fields indicates that the soil condition has
extensive surface anthropogenic modification affecting soil morphology. Basic requirements for
establishing series, including transects to determine map unit composition, will be met. New map units
will be developed, some map line work will be modified, and all data associated with the data mapunits
will be updated. The project will encompass the 2016 and possibly 2017 fiscal years. It will require an
estimated 250 staff hours (0.12 staff years) to complete. Travel costs are anticipated.
Example 3.
Hydric ratings, as well as forestland suitability, are very important water quality/quantity issues with
Pelham soils. This map unit is correlated in 9 counties along with other Pelham map units mapped along
the GA-FL line. Determining and populating the exact water table associated properties for this ponded
phase will erase an issue where hydric ratings differ along State lines. As a result, more consistent
interpretations will be available for farmers, as well as State and Federal agencies that utilize this data for
suitability and compliance determinations. This project will focus on MLRA 153A/B in Florida/Georgia
within transition areas between non-ponded Pelham units as well as along drain heads and flat, sluggish
drains without well-defined channels. This is a substantial project, requiring transects, sample collection
for base saturation, as well as ponding frequency observations. With one staff person, this project will
take 1 year.
Example 4.
Huckleberry is a benchmark series in MLRA 43A and has been mapped in a cryic temperature regime in
4 surveys (ID606, ID670, WA065, WA651). Currently, the associated forest canopy is western red cedar,
subalpine fir, and mountain hemlock. Current research supports a cryic temperature regime for soils
occurring under a subalpine fir or mountain hemlock canopy and a frigid temperature regime for soils
under a western red cedar canopy. Huckleberry components will be evaluated against vegetative models
and then field verified to refine plant condition mapping. The Huckleberry series concept will be updated
and a frigid counterpart developed for areas with a western red cedar canopy. This project encompasses
181,400 acres. It will take two field seasons by one staff person to complete due to short seasons and
remote travel locations.

649-B.17
Example 5.
Soil wind erosion of the Ulysses eroded map units has significantly changed the soil condition in 7
counties in MLRA 72 as identified by farmers in the area. Transects will be run on these map units to
verify map unit composition and identify soil condition characteristics. Significant KSSL samples are
available; however, additional samples will be collected to compare surface soil properties between non-
eroded and eroded phases of these map units. Soil classification may change due to erosion. The
evaluation of these map units found a potential difference in soil properties impacting the Kf value
interpretation. This study is significant with almost 150,000 acres. Fieldwork should be completed in one
field season by one staff year.
Example 6.
The map unit “Frederick silt loam, 8 to 15 percent slopes” occurs in the large limestone valley in the
mesic part of MLRA 128. The map unit is in four counties, but is absent in two adjacent counties
(VA155 and VA121). Past correlation concepts varied, and similar soils, such as Groseclose or Lodi,
were preferred in VA155 and VA121 in place of Frederick. New field transect data from the similar map
units in VA155 and VA121, combined with existing data, will confirm or disprove that the Frederick
map unit can be extended and correlated into these two counties. Spot checks where Frederick is
currently mapped will verify those correlations. Soil delineations will be joined between counties, and
attribute data will be updated. The result will be consistent map unit correlation on this particular
hillslope in the MLRA. The project will benefit land use and conservation decisions by providing
consistent and improved data. The fieldwork will be completed in 1/3 of a field season by 2 staff.
Example 7.
Atmore soils occupy water collection positions on the landscape, receiving and filtering both surface
runoff and subsurface flow downslope above a restrictive layer. They occur in ecological sites commonly
referred to as pitcher plant bogs and host vegetative communities dominated by hydrophytic vegetation of
a jurisdictional wetland. These map units include a variety of carnivorous plants and some endangered
species, and are well represented in an ecological system known as the longleaf pine savannah. Atmore is
mapped in MLRA 133A and 152A in 13 counties, occupying 164,442 acres. Evaluations suggest
potential differences in soil properties (such as texture, silt content, and plinthite amount) related to
differences in parent material age and depositional environment, topography, hydrology, and landform
position across the extent of this map unit. Additional characterization data is needed for these
ecologically sensitive areas. This project will be completed by four staff members within 2 years.
Example 8.
Severe dust storms are reducing air quality and visibility along the I-10 corridor where playa systems
occur. Several cooperators have requested updated soil and ecological site information for these playa
areas. The scope of MLRA 41 – Update of the Animas Valley Playas and Adjoining Map Units is to
update all playa areas that exist throughout MLRA 41, LRU 41.2. All geographically associated
landforms, such as basin floor, play dune, piedmont, and drainageway, will be assessed and updated
accordingly. This effort will develop new map units, modify existing map units, evaluate ecological sites,
and update all data associated with the data map units. This effort will be accomplished by gathering all
current documentation, collecting additional documentation as needed, and sampling map unit
components for characterization data. The project consists of private, BLM, and State lands for a total of
105,027 acres. It will be completed with two personnel in 1 year.
Example 9
Wind erosion impacts the Optima loamy sand, 10 to 25 percent slopes found in the Dust Bowl area of
Oklahoma and Kansas. The evaluation identified soil composition and spatial join deficiencies.
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-649-H, XX Ed., Amend. X, Month Year)
649-B.18
Documented deficiencies include pedons that are npt spatially representative of the map unit extent and a
lack of transects to estimate map unit composition. KSSL data is available for the OSD type location and
supports soil properties and classification. Local laboratory data will be collected to improve
identification of physical and chemical properties and refine soil interpretations. Soil polygon
boundaries, through field investigation, will be edited to create exact county line joins. This project
covers 49,850 acres. It will involve one staff person and be completed within 1 year.
Example 10.
Review of Barnes series, an extensive benchmark soil in MLRA 55A and 55B that is mapped across
Souris, Leeds, and Red River till lobes, produced concerns that physical and chemical properties and
hydrology within each lobe were not adequately reflected by MLRA map units. Representative pedons
will be identified, documented, and sampled. Selected locations will be instrumented with monitoring
wells and rain gauges to justify or refute consolidation, separation, and classification and assist in
modeling hydrology, all of which will benefit State interpretations and planning. Analyzed MLRA field
project data and KSSL samples (salt analysis group) collected on all lobes by two staff in two field
seasons (KSSL results to follow) will augment NASIS and document areas with high probability of being
affected by salinity/sodicity. Cumulative hydrologic monitoring over multiple MLRA field projects,
completed by two staff in five field seasons, initiated with this project will provide a measure of seasonal
wetness variability.
Example 11.
Condit soils are very poorly drained soils that occur in depressions and drainageways where water table
features significantly influence plant condition. A single ponding frequency, duration, and depth is
currently assigned to all Condit map units. Landform features that influence hydrologic properties were
not considered in the existing database. Using digital soil mapping tools and LIDAR analysis, a
hydrologic model will be used to identify landform features known to influence water tables. Those
features will then be used to differentiate condit map units into phases that assign ponding frequency,
depth, and duration, which will help farmers to better evaluate their potential for crop production.
Landowner evaluations of the phased maps will be used to test their usefulness for predicting water
features. This project covers the portion of LRU 111E behind the Broadway end moraine, but the
hydrologic model can be adapted for other ponded soils. Required SSO staff time: 0.5 staff year.
Example 12
Bangor, Dixmont, and other acidic tills mapped on the calcareous Waterville Formation may not best
represent soil conditions as they exist across portions of a 10-county area in MLRA 144B and 143 in
central Maine. Recently sampled lab data supports correlation to high lime soils of the recently
established Sebasticook catena. Interpretations and program applications would be improved by this
revised data. Selective field investigation, review of lab and other published data, and geospatial analysis
of bedrock geology will be used to determine the best correlation. This project covers about 250,000
acres. SSO staff time is estimated at 1.75 staff years for production and quality control; regional office
staff time is estimated at .10 staff years for support, quality assurance, correlation, and certification.
Publication of the data to the Web Soil Survey is done by the State soil scientist. The project is proposed
to begin in FY 2018 and last 1 year.
Example of a Complete Project Description
Soil erosion of the MLRA 72 - Ulysses silt loam, 3 to 6 percent slopes map units has significantly
changed the soil condition in 27 counties in MLRA 72. Transects will be run on these map units to verify
map unit composition and identify phase characteristics. Significant KSSL samples are available;
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook

however, additional samples will be collected to compare surface soil properties between non-eroded and
eroded phases of these map units. Soil classification may change due to erosion. The evaluation of these
map units found a potential difference in soil properties impacting the Kf value interpretation. This study
is significant with almost 150,000 acres, and may take 2 staff years to complete with extensive travel
throughout western Kansas and eastern Colorado.
Project Details:
Project: MLRA 72 - Ulysses sil, 3-6, maintenance continued (58549)
Objectives and Procedures
This project will complete the maintenance for the Ulysses silt loam, 3 to 6 percent slopes map units. The
maintenance was started in 1999 as part of the Kansas initiative to investigate the degree of erosion in the
Ulysses map units that have slope greater than 3 percent. The maintenance was suspended in 2012 so
staff could focus on the SDJR initiative.
The Garden City SSO collected pedons in FY 2011 and FY 2012 and entered the pedons that were
collected in 1999, 2003, 2011, and 2012 into NASIS. For the 1859 map units in Kansas, 512 pedons have
been entered in NASIS and analyzed. Pedons remain to be collected in the following counties:
Rawlins Co., Kansas (ks153)
Sherman Co., Kansas (ks181)
Thomas Co., Kansas (ks193)
Wallace Co., Kansas (ks199)
Wichita Co., Kansas (ks203)
Hayes Co., Nebraska (ne085)
This project will include:
 Field investigation of Ulysses silt loam, 3 to 6 percent slopes (1859) in the counties listed above
 Field investigation of Ulysses silt loam, 3 to 6 percent slopes, eroded (1860) in Chase (ne029)
and Hitchcock (ne087) Counties of Nebraska
 Joins along the Kansas-Nebraska State line where 1859 polygons in Kansas join Nebraska
 Joins along the Kansas-Nebraska State line where 1860 polygons in Nebraska join Kansas
The project extent is 538,584 acres with 6,203 polygons. The extent is 90 percent in MLRA 72 and 10
percent in MLRA 73. The extent is listed by county in a table at the end of this document. All of the
Kansas and Colorado extent was combined during the first phase of this maintenance in 2013, and that
extent is represented by national mapunit symbol 2mb5b, which is supported by DMUID 626924. We did
not submit the Nebraska extent to the SDJR process.
The originally mapped Ulysses silt loam, 3 to 6 percent slopes map units were assigned to the Loamy
Upland ESD and were not HEL, with WEI/WEG values of 48/6. The maintenance of 1999 was started
because of complaints that the Ulysses silt loam map units, with slopes greater than 3 percent, should be
HEL and in the Limy Upland ecological site because they have free carbonates in the surface layer. The
resource soil scientists thought the difference was caused by erosion that occurred after the original
mapping. In the past 3 years, the ecological site specialists have indicated that this map unit has some
areas that support the Loamy Upland plant community and some that support the Limy Upland
community. The ecologists focused on this map unit because part of it is in prime Lesser Prairie Chicken
habitat.

Areas Included in the Project
We will begin by describing the Ulysses TUDs in the counties listed below. We will try to incorporate
these TUDs in the traverses we plan to complete.
Finney Co., Kansas (ks055)
Gove Co., Kansas (ks063)
Gray Co., Kansas (ks069)
Greeley Co., Kansas (ks071) (Ulysses type location)
Lane Co., Kansas (ks101)
Logan Co., Kansas (ks109)
Rawlins Co., Kansas (ks153)
Scott Co., Kansas (ks171)
Sheridan Co., Kansas (ks179)
Sherman Co., Kansas (ks181)
Stanton Co., Kansas (ks187)
Thomas Co., Kansas (ks193)
Wallace Co., Kansas (ks199)
Wichita Co., Kansas (ks203)
Chase Co., Nebraska (ne029)
Hayes Co., Nebraska (ne085)
Hitchcock Co., Nebraska (ne087)
The following counties only have a few polygons because 1859 was added to facilitate SSURGO joins,
so the TUDs will not be described.
Cheyenne Co., Colorado (co017)
Cheyenne Co., Kansas (ks023)
Decatur Co., Kansas (ks039)
Ford Co., Kansas (ks057)
Graham Co., Kansas (ks065)
Greeley Co., Kansas (ks071)
Ness Co., Kansas (ks135)
Trego Co., Kansas (ks195)
Lincoln Co., Nebraska (ne111)
We will then collect three 5-hole traverses in each of the counties listed below, focusing on the various
surface morphometries that are expressed within the polygons. This approach was chosen instead of the
10-hole equidistant transect method because we want to be able to analyze the pedons by surface
morphometry. We may need to collect more traverses to define the 1860 map unit, but I think the 1859
map unit will be well served with twenty-four more 5-hole traverses.
Rawlins Co., Kansas (ks153)
Sherman Co., Kansas (ks181)
Thomas Co., Kansas (ks193)
Wallace Co., Kansas (ks199)
Wichita Co., Kansas (ks203)
Chase Co., Nebraska (ne029)
Hayes Co., Nebraska (ne085)
Hitchcock Co., Nebraska (ne087)
For each county listed above, we also will collect a full pedon description in a location we feel is
representative of the major component. We will do this in five polygons in each county. The chosen
polygons will not be those that received a traverse.
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-649-H, XX Ed., Amend. X, Month Year)
649-B.21
In addition to the 512 pedons already collected, this plan will result in a new full description at seventeen
Ulysses TUD sites, twenty-four 5-hole traverses, and 40 full pedon descriptions for the 1859 map unit.
The 1860 map unit will have six 5-hole traverses and 10 full pedon descriptions collected. This collection
will provide 690 full pedon descriptions by the end of the project.

Summary of work completed to date.—The Garden City SSO has reviewed the 512 pedons that were
collected and find the following. Additional data collected in this project will be reviewed to determine if
the trends, summarized below, are representative of the entire extent.
Title 430 – National Soil Survey Handbook
(430-649-H, XX Ed., Amend. X, Month Year)
649-B.23
Classification
 41 percent of the pedons classify as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Torriorthentic
Haplustolls (Quinter [tentative])
 23 percent classify as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustepts (Buffalo Park)
 11 percent classify as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls (Ulysses)
The 512 pedons suggest this map unit is more complicated than its consociation designation indicates.
The map unit is a patchwork of plant communities that cannot be modeled by landform. I think the map
unit may become a Quinter consociation with a Ulysses, Buffalo Park, and swale minor component.
There is evidence that the Torriorthentic Haplustolls should be separated from the Aridic Haplustolls.
This would require a new soil series (Quinter), for which I have selected a type location, acquired KSSL
data, and developed a tentative OSD. The separation will be especially helpful for the Ulysses map units
that have slope greater than 6 percent because we have not found Ulysses soils in these polygons.
Timeframe
This extensive project covers many counties and will begin in April 2016 with major fieldwork
completed by November 2016. Field lab analysis, database population, and spatial editing will be
completed by April 2017. Field travel to each county will be from 30 minutes to 2 hours. While at each
site, a 10-hole transect will be obtained on designated polygons. Polygons outside the heart of the map
units will be field checked and pedon descriptions obtained. The project will include fieldwork for
transecting, field descriptions, and sample selection collecting the needed analyses as explained above.
This project is planned to be submitted to the regional office for quality assurance and correlation in July
2017.
Benefits
The major benefit is to develop a consistent map unit across the southern reaches of MLRA 72
recognizing the erosion of the Ulysses map unit.
Outcome and Deliverables
Improving the population of soil properties associated with eroded Ulysses will help planners better
determine conservation practices needed on these eroded soils.
Ecological Site Descriptions (ESD).—Recent interdisciplinary work on the Loamy Tableland ESD
established a depth to free carbonates of greater than 15 cm (6 inches) for the Loamy Tableland soils and
less than 15 cm (6 inches) for the Limy Tableland soils. The statistics below are developed from that
depth to free carbonate break and landform.
 48 percent of the pedons would be assigned to the Loamy Upland ESD
 43 percent of the pedons would be assigned to the Limy Upland ESD
 8 percent of the pedons would be assigned to the Swales ESD
Surface effervescence class (Highly Erodible Land, or HEL).—Twenty percent of the 512 pedons would
be HEL. The Buffalo Park component (Aridic Haplustepts) would represent these soils. The effervescent
strength (tested with 1M HCL) is described below.
 Noneffervescent 70 percent
 Very slightly effervescent 2 percent
 Slightly effervescent 8 percent
 Strongly effervescent 12 percent

 Violently effervescent 8 percent
Maximum effervescence (0-25cm)
 36 percent of the pedons have strong effervescence
 33 percent are noneffervescent
 21 percent have violent effervescence
 57 percent of the pedons have strong or violent effervescence in the root zone
 Average depth to the top of the strong or violent effervescence is 12 cm, for pedons with strong
or violent effervescence as maximum strength in the root zone
Surface layers with strong to violent effervescence are considered to be HEL. More than half of the 512
pedons have strong or violent effervescence in the root zone and this affects the plant communities. This
map unit (1859) will not be HEL, but it needs an HEL component for the planners to use where needed.
Based on work already completed, the Ulysses map units with slope greater than 6 percent are probably
going to be considered HEL map units and will no longer be considered Ulysses.
The pedon data suggests this map unit should be a consociation of Quinter that is not HEL (48/6) and in
the Loamy Upland ESD. Quinter could represent the Aridic Haplustolls (Ulysses) if a Ulysses minor
component needs to be avoided.
There should be a Buffalo Park minor component (10 percent component composition) that is HEL
(86/4L) because 20 percent of the pedons have strong to violent effervescence in the surface and more
than 50 percent have this effervescent strength in the root zone. The Buffalo Park component will
provide an HEL component and a Limy Upland component for the users to allow for the patchy areas of
HEL.
With 20 percent of the map unit eligible for HEL designation, we may want to create a Quinter-Buffalo
Park undifferentiated group, but that is not often desirable. Statistics cannot define the landform position
of the HEL component. The HEL (Buffalo Park) and non-HEL (Quinter) components are predominantly
on backslopes of side slopes.
Of the 512 pedons collected to date for the 1859 maintenance in Kansas, 60 pedons (12 percent) fit the
current Ulysses classification. A Ulysses minor component could be added to provide the users with a
component that is non-HEL and in the Loamy Upland ESD, and this minor component would have
interpretive rankings that are very similar to the Torriorthentic Haplustolls component.
With 8 percent of the pedons in swales, there is a case for another minor component, probably Duroc.
Field review of plant communities within previously collected transects is advised. The ecological site
specialist and Garden City SSO have found that broom snakeweed can be used as an indicator species for
the Limy Upland sites. This indicator was not documented when transects were collected, and
verification may be helpful in the future.
Travel Budget
Considering an average 90-mile round trip, 4 days per week, for 10 months, is 14,400 miles with an
average 15 mpg, and $2.50 gasoline cost per gallon, there is a potential $2,400 cost associated with this
project. No overnight travel is associated with this project.
