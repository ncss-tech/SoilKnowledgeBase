The update of soil survey is a systematic process designed to improve official soil survey information (see General Manual, Title 430, Part 402, Section 402.5(A)) with consideration of the full extent of soils and ecological sites across a major land resource area (MLRA) (see Part 649, Subpart A, Section 649.2 of this handbook). Updating by MLRA is a continuous activity of inventory and assessment, data collection, synthesis, review, and recertification of existing soil survey and ecological site information that brings all information to a common standard. The MLRA soil survey update is planned and organized using scheduled projects that systematically focus on specific groups of soils or landforms and the associated support data, interpretations, and maps.",

A single MLRA map unit is created with fully populated properties, qualities, and interpretations for components and horizons. This process is the underpinning of MLRA correlation. Reportable acres are 20 percent of the total project map unit acres. Projects are goaled and reported within the assigned fiscal year. The MLRA assessment and correlation strategy: (i)     Bridges the inventory and assessment and the MLRA field project using information obtained from the map unit inventory and assessment to readily accomplish MLRA correlation and database population; (ii)     Uses existing soil survey information and correlation documents in conjunction with limited field visits; (iii) Relies on the experience and knowledge of technical team members; (iv) Ensures that same-named and similarly named map units are reviewed and that duplicate map units with the same map unit concept are correlated into a single map unit that extends seamlessly across political boundaries; (v) Requires map unit names to be correlated to common MLRA phase criteria; (vi) Contains a project name beginning with the prefix \\\"SDJR - MLRA XXX - <project name>\\\"; and (vii) Assists staff in identifying additional MLRA field projects.",

A \\\"map unit\\\" approach is effective when the update need is to collect data to fill voids in the data mapunit or to determine map unit composition. A \\\"landform\\\" approach is effective in areas where current mapping concepts or soil survey maps are inconsistent. The result is a seamless coverage of attribute and spatial data across political boundaries within the MLRA. MLRA field projects involve the field collection of data or spatial revision that is beyond the scope of MLRA assessment and correlation, as described in Section 610.3(C)(1). MLRA field projects are intended to address most, if not all, of the prioritized update needs identified during the inventory and assessment. Reportable acres are 100 percent of the total project map unit acres. An MLRA field project requires, and is focused on, the results of an inventory and assessment. It identifies the project concern and collects the necessary documentation to address the agency resource concerns. It focuses on a single map unit concept or landform or on multiple map unit concepts and a catena or landform. Timeframes range from weeks to as much as 2 years, depending on the project size and extent. Extensive update needs are to be addressed on a map unit or landform basis. Key update issues must be identified in the inventory and assessment. The work is then prioritized and ranked. Proposed project plans are developed and included in the long-range plan report. These projects are addressed within the confines of an approved MLRA project and contained within its timelines. Assistance from National Cooperative Soil Survey partners may be necessary or desired for extensive updates. Extensive updates must be reviewed and prioritized by the management team and board of advisors based on the overall needs of the entire MLRA soil survey area. Updated soil survey information is supported by the documentation requirements as given in Part 627, Section 627.08 of this handbook. Approval to conduct any extensive revision must be obtained from the Director of the Soil Science Division (refer to General Manual, Title 430, Part 402, Subpart A, Section 402.5(C)).

They are undertaken in order to clarify or augment existing soil survey or ecological site information used in update projects. These studies may address hydric soils, saturated soil layers, saturated hydraulic conductivity, chemistry or mineralogy, climate, dynamic soil properties, and other site- specific soil conditions. Consideration should be given to involving NCSS partners, adjoining soil survey offices, and staff of the National Soil Survey Center (NSSC) and Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL). Such involvement should be designed to reduce the local workload, shorten the time required to complete, or bring expertise to support the project. Special investigations are a milestone activity within a MLRA field project. An investigation plan is developed by the soil survey leader in consultation with the regional office, NSSC liaison, and partner agencies. Investigation plans are written in the Project Text table (see Section 610.4(C)). Progress and reportable acres are managed in the associated MLRA field project. Most special investigations should focus upon soils or conditions occurring extensively within the MLRA, so that findings can be applied to similar adjacent soils and ecological sites. Those for soils with limited extent should address issues critical to interpretation or management of these areas. The milestone \\\"Scheduled Completion Date\\\" for some special investigations and monitoring activities may extend beyond the \\\"Scheduled Completion Date\\\" for the associated MLRA field project. In these cases, the MLRA field project can still be completed and acres reported if all other milestone activities are accomplished.

Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.15 (Example of a Project Evaluation Ranking Procedure) can be used to create a soil survey office area ranking and prioritizing formula. A ranking procedure that evaluates the need and importance of individual projects, especially projects that require substantial resources, aids in prioritization of staff and resources. Soil survey offices should periodically review their ranking procedures to ensure that they are addressing important issues and are consistent across the soil survey office area. Ranking criteria are created to defend ranking decisions. Each soil survey office will have unique issues to consider when developing ranking criteria. Items to consider when ranking projects include: -    Status of initial soil surveys and the specific map units requiring re-correlation -    Age of the survey and soil series and issues with the series concept or classification -    Agency resource concerns for addressing Farm Bill and technical or financial assistance (see Part 610, Subpart B, Exhibits, Section 610.10) -    Program and project needs of cooperating agencies -    Requests by local constituents and frequency of complaints or appeals -    Needs of Federal partners regarding Federal lands -    Information that aids in land use planning and decisions, such as tax evaluation consistency -    Rapid land use changes in areas where critical soil problems are expected -    Cost share contributions of funds or staffing -    Other factors of specific local importance -    Survey boundary join status -    Consistency in map unit kind (phases, taxadjuncts, miscellaneous units) -    Consistency of the soil property data -    Interpretive issues -    Number of acres affected -    Spatial line placement and conflicts with the landscape model -    Amount of KSSL lab data -    Benchmark status of the series",
