"BARLOW","DUPLICATION OF HEADERS","[RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 47 degrees F. The average summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. with an 0 horizon. The soils have an udic moisture regime. The driest period is in the summer but the soils are dry for less than 45 consecutive days. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Depth to stony glacial till ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 24 inches. The 10- to 40-inch control section has less than an average of 10 percent clay and has 20 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.,TYPE LOCATION:  Clackamas County, Oregon; 200 feet west of the Timberline Highway; NE1/4 NE1/4 section 18, T.3S., R.9E.
