  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Auberry soils occur on backslopes and footslopes of hillslopes and mountain slopes. They are underlain by acid intrusive igneous rocks, principally quartz diorite or grandiorite. They occur at elevations of 260 to 1150 meters. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The climate is Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 435 to 980 mm, of which 1 to 5 percent occurs as snow. The average January temperature is 5 degrees C. the average July temperature is 25 degrees C; and the mean annual air temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C. The average frost-free season is 215 to 315 days."

Coarsegold soils are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact with schist and have a base saturation of more than 75 percent in the upper 75 cm of the argillic horizon. Sierra soils occur on similar landforms, though tend to be higher on the landscape, have hues redder than 7.5YR, and have a paralithic contact with intrusive igneous rock at depths of 100 to over 200 cm. Tollhouse soils have a mollic epipedon and a paralithic contact above a depth of 50 cm."
