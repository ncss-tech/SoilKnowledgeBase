Content of fragments of sandstone or pebbles of quartzite less than 3 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume in each horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue if 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present; BE horizon, where present; or Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8.

Lily soils usually on slightly higher, more broad smooth plateaus are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon.  Ramsey soils on higher and lower lying on adjacent sideslopes are less than 20 inches to hard sandstone bedrock."
