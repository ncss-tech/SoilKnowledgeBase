  "OVERVIEW": "The Amsterdam series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, lacustrine, or loess deposited materials mixed with volcanic ash.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
