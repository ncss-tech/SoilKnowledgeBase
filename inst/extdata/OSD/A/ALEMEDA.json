  "OVERVIEW": "The Alemeda series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in moderately coarse textured eolian sediments mixed with basalt gravel, cobbles, and stones and overlying basalt bedrock. Alameda soils are on nearly level to rolling slopes on basalt flows of Quaternary age. Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
