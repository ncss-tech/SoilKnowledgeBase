  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Alemeda soils are on nearly level to rolling slopes on basalt flows of Quaternary age. The soils formed in moderately coarse textured eolian sediments mixed with basalt, gravel, cobbles, and stones and overlying basalt bedrock. Basalt rock outcrops are common. The mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 65 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with a definite summer maximum."
