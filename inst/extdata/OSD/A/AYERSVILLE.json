  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils have varying amounts of non-durable fragments throughout the solum that disintegrate in the laboratory in particle-size analysis. The relative percent of sand, silt, and clay-size particles fluctuates with the degree of agitation in the laboratory. Similar soils with somewhat higher content of non-durable fragments are on the same landscapes. These soils are not extensive enough to identify another series.\n03/13/2003. Ayersville soils are of minor extent (2,500 acres) and have only been correlated in Rockingham County, NC. The official series type location description requires revision to meet present series standards. An extensive review of this series is recommended with the update or maintenance of the soil survey area.\n06/14/2007. The terms used for texture modifiers were changed from rock fragments to pararock fragments to more accurately reflect fragment hardness.  This revision is not a change in the series concept and was not confirmed by re-examination of the pedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from 8 to 22 inches (Bw horizon)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 30 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: No laboratory data available.\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--82200\nTABULAR SERIES DATA: (Based on original SOI-5.)\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0135 AYERSVILLE  2-60   52- 57   175-210   40-55   300-600\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock  Hardness\nNC0135 NONE          >6.0       -      -       20-40    HARD\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                 3-Inch  No-10   Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0135  0-8   L SIL SICL              0-10    80-100  12-27   3-7\nNC0135  0-8   GR-L GR-SIL GR-SICL    10-20    70-100  12-27   3-7\nNC0135  8-22  GR-SIL GR-L L           0-20    70-100  18-35   3-8\nNC0135 22-26  GR-SIL GR-L GRV-SIL    10-45    70-100   8-20   2-5\nNC0135 26-30  WB                       -       -        -      -\nNC0135 30-40  UWB                      -       -        -      -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
