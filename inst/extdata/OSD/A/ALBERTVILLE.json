  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to soft shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Content of shale or sandstone fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid, except for surface horizons where the soil has been limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. In untilled areas, the A horizon\nhas hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3, chroma of 1 to 3, and is less than 4 inches thick. Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. In some pedons, the lower Bt horizons commonly display lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, red, yellow, or less commonly gray. Texture is mostly silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam, but includes silty clay or clay in the lower part. Clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, have colors and textures similar to the lower Bt horizons. Lithochromic mottles in various shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray are present in most pedons and commonly increase with depth.\nThe Cr horizon is soft shale that commonly displays relic platy structure and becomes massive with depth. A lithic contact with harder materials is present in some pedons, but is not a requirement of the series."

These soils formed in residuum weathered from shale, interbedded shale and sandstone, or less commonly shale and siltstone. The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 53 inches."
