Coarse fragments of gravel and cobbles of chert, sandstone, and quartzite range from 0 to 30 percent in the A\nhorizon and 0 to 10 percent in the B2t horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid except for surface layers that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, silt loam or their gravelly counterparts.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3, and chroma\nof 3 through 6.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  The upper 20\ninches of the B2t has more than 20 percent silt and more than 20 percent sand.  Black concretions and coatings range from few to common.  Base saturation is more than 15 percent."
