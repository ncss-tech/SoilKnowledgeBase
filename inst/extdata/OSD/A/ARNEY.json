Deuchars soils have more than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Jeneva soils do not have subhorizons with brittleness within the series control section. Percell soils have less than 25 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Tarhollow soils have more than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Westgate soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in some subhorizon within the argillic horizon."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.7 to 12.8 degrees C (53 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days."
