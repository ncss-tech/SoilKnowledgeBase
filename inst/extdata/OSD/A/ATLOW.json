Checkett soils are calcareous in all parts and have hues redder than 5YR.  Cottle soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the argillic horizon. Dorkiss has an abrupt textural change between the A horizon and the Bt horizon and average 50 to 70 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Fortyday and Gabbvally soils contain less than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Thike soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Chubard and Hooplite soils are less than 36 cm deep.  Nevo soils are neutral or slightly alkaline and are 13 to 25 cm to a lithic contact.  Olac soils have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and average 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section.  Old Camp soils have Bt horizons with 50 to 75 percent rock fragments, mainly cobbles and stones.  Phliss soils have Btk horizons and have channery rock fragments.  Richinde soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms.  Rowel soils are less than 36 cm deep and have Bt horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  Soughe soils lack carbonates in the profile, have rock fragments that are mainly cobbles and stones and lack carbonate coatings on rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Stewval soils are less than 36 cm deep, and are calcareous in all parts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Atlow soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum derived from chert, argillite, shale, altered rhyolitic tuff, and andesite.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm (in central Oregon ranging as low as 150 mm), the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
