  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 18 to 30 cm (7 to 12 inches) in thickness. Free carbonates typically occur throughout but the upper 25 cm (10 inches) may be neutral. Rock fragments comprise 1 to 10 percent by volume of the 0 to 152 cm ( 0 to 60 inch) series control section with shale fragments being the most common component. The 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages between 27 and 35 percent clay after removing clay size carbonates and 15 to 40 percent fine sand and coarser. Some subhorizons have up to 55 percent clay. The upper part of the particle-size control section has more than 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nAn AB horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bk or Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 4. Redox features with chroma of 2 through 8 are present. It is clay, silty clay or clay loam. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 30 percent.\nWhere present, the 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Redox features with chroma of 2 through 8 are present. It is loam or clay loam. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Crippin soils have less than 30 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section and the weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is less than 30 percent. Floyd soils formed in stratified material over firm till. Fostoria and Merton soils do not have free carbonates above 61 cm (24 inches). Kensett soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Nicollet, Ottosen, Readlyn, and Snider soils have a B horizon leached of carbonates. Stabbart soils are drier in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following summer solstice. Wilmonton soils do not have free carbonates above 51 cm (20 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arkton soils are on convex positions on shoulders within topography of moderate to high relief. Slope gradient ranges from 4 to 40 percent. They formed in a thin discontinuous fine textured mantle overlying firm till on moraines. The material was thought to be of the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsinan Age, but some evidence indicates it may be \"pre-Wisconsinan\" in age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 9 degrees C ( 45 to 49 degrees F). The mean annual precipitation ranges from 584 to 711 mm (23 to 28 inches). Frost-free days range from 155 to 200. Elevation above sea level ranges from 320 to 366 m (1050 to 1200 feet)."

Poorly drained Cosmos soils are on nearly level, lower lying positions on the landscape. Poorly drained Corvuso soils are calcareous and are on rims bordering depressions. Poorly drained Danielson soils are on footslopes. Somewhat poorly drained Kandiyohi soils are on summits. Very poorly drained Lura soils are in closed depressions. Moderately well drained Newlondon soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on shoulders. Moderately well drained Strout soils have a cambic horizon and are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes."
