  "OVERVIEW": "The Acove series consists of soils that are moderately deep to paralithic sandstone bedrock. These well drained soils formed in loamy residuum derived from sandstone of Cambrian age. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on shoulders and summits of ridges on dissected plateaus of the Central Basin. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
