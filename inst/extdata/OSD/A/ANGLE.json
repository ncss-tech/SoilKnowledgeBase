  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 12 and 36 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.   Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid.  Coarse fragments in the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizons has color with value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.\nThe E horizon has color with value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry; and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 2 to 4 dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand, and is gravelly, stony, or cobbly in some pedons.  Where texture of the E horizons is sandy loam, the horizon does not extend into the particle-size control section.\nThe E part of the E&B horizons have value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist, 2 to 4 dry.  They are massive or single grained.  Texture is gravelly sand, sand, or cobbly sand.  The B part consists of discontinuous 0 to 2-inch thick pink (7.5YR 7/4) or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand and coarse sandy loam lamellae.  The lamellae do not meet thickness requirements for an argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Angle soils are on terrace escarpments and terrace remnants.  The regolith consists of glacial outwash with some mixture of pumice and volcanic ash in the surface layers.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  Elevation is 2,000 to 3,500 feet.  The climate has cool, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Average annual rainfall is 25 to 40 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. Growing season at 28 degrees F is 135 to 175 days."
