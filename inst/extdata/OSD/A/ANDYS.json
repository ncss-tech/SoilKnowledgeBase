  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter months; and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at a 20 inch depth is more than 41 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 8 inches thick.  Thickness of the solum is 35 to 50 inches thick.  Rock fragment content in the control section ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 7 to 10 inches.  Depth of the calcic horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragment content is 5 to 45 percent.  It is slightly calcareous or moderately calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam and gravelly sandy loam.  Clay content is 8 to 18 percent.  Rock fragment content is 5 to 30 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3.  It is commonly gravelly sandy loam and loam, and less commonly gravelly sand.  The C horizon is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Keedlar series in the same family and the Luhon and Bruman (T) series in similar families.  The Keeldar soils have a calcic horizon deeper than 10 inches below the surface.  Also, the calcic horizon is thicker than 40 inches.  Luhon soils are in the fine-loamy family and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Bruman (T) soils are in the loamy-skeletal family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Andys soils are on fan terraces, mountainsides and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium mainly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks but to a lesser extent from sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees. F.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year with about 55 percent falling between April and September.  July, August and September are the wettest months, with December and January being the driest.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,500 feet.  The freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."
