  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 75 inches and the base of the argillic horizon is below 40 inches.  Bedrock is below 5 feet and usually is below 10 feet.  Rock fragments of subrounded gravel usually increase with depth and range from 5 to 25 percent by volume in the A and BA horizons, from 5 to 40 percent in subhorizons of the Bt horizon, and from 10 to 80 percent in the BC and C horizons.  Kaolinite is the dominant clay mineral with smaller amounts of illite, chlorite, and vermiculite.  The soil ranges from strongly acid through extremely acid, where unlimed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Fine-earth texture is dominantly silty clay loam but includes clay loam, silt loam, loam, silty clay, or clay.  The Bt horizon averages less than 35 percent clay but ranges from 25 to 42 percent in subhorizons.  It has moderate or strong, medium or coarse blocky, subangular blocky, or prismatic structure and is firm or very firm.\nThe BA and BC horizons have colors similar to the Bt horizons but also include reddish brown, brown, and strong brown.  They also have structure like the Bt horizons but include weak grades.  The BC horizon ranges to platy or it is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Variegated colors and reticulate mottles as well as black stains are common.  The C horizon has fine-earth textures dominantly of silty clay loam or clay loam but ranges from stratified sand and gravel to clay."

Of these, only the Albemarle, Arendtsville, Aura, Bedington, Birdsboro, Chester, Eubanks, Meadowville, Nixon, Shouns, Thurmont, Ungers and Whiteford soils have hues 5YR and redder and sola thicker than 40 inches.  Albemarle, Birdsboro, Chester, and Ungers soils have argillic horizons that end at a depth of less than 40 inches.  Arendtsville soils have rock fragments dominated by quartzite, sandstone and aporhyolite.  Aura soils have sandy clay loam or sandy loam argillic horizons.  Bedington soils have rock fragments that are dominantly of shale.  Meadowville soils have mica flakes in the solum.  Eubanks soils do not have sandstone, siltstone and shale rock fragments.  Nixon soils have rock fragments dominanted by quartzite cobbles and red shale.  Shouns soils formed in colluvium and alluvium and are at the base of ridges.  Thurmont soils have rock fragments dominanted by quartz, quartzite and gneiss.  Whiteford soils have rock fragments that are dominantly of slate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Allenwood soils are on smooth or slightly convex uplands.  Slopes are dominantly 3 to 8 percent but range from 2 to 25.  The soils formed in loamy pre-Wisconsin glacial till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale, similar to that of the underlying rock.  The climate is humid temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., and the frost free season ranges from 140 to 170 days."
