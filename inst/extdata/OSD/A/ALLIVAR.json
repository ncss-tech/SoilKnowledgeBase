The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  When it is 16 or more inches thick, it has a sandy particle size in the major part.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 5 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is loamy sand in the lower part of some pedons.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.
