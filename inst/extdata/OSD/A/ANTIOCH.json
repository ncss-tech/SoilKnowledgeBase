  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature 59 to 64 F. The soils become moist in some or all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches about late November and usually remain moist all the time until late May or early June.  The soils remain dry all rest of the time.  Few pebbles are present throughout the some pedons.  Coarse and very coarse sand is less than 5 percent.\nThe A1 horizon is dark grayish brown, dark brown, brown, grayish brown, or light brownish gray.  It contains more than 1 percent organic matter in the upper 10 inches, but is hard and massive when dry.  This horizon is neutral to strongly acid, though neutral saturation in some pedons.\nThe A2 horizon is gray, light brownish, light brownish gray or light gray and is slightly to strongly acid.  The A2-Bt horizon boundary is abrupt or very abrupt.  The Bt horizon is dark brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown and pale brown 10YR hue and light olive brown and light yellowish brown in 2.5Y hue.  It is medium acid to moderately alkaline, becoming more alkaline with increasing depth.  All of the Bt horizon has more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  It is clay or heavy clay loam and has approximately 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has weak or moderate columnar moderate to strong prismatic structure in the upper part.  Usually there are transitional horizons to the C horizon. The lower Bt horizons or B3 or C horizons are calcareous in some or all parts.\nThe C horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown, yellowish brown or dark yellowish brown, it is somewhat stratified and is usually clay loam or loam in texture.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline."

Bonsall and Stockpen soils lack an albic horizon.  Las Flores, Milipitas, and Tierra soils lack natric horizons.  Lethent soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Placentia soils have about 15 to 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the B2t horizon.  Riz soils lack an abrupt A-B horizon boundary with more than 15 percent absolute clay difference.  San Miguel soils have a lithic contact at depth of 20 to 34 inches.  Solano and Waukena soils have less than 35 percent clay in the natric horizon."
