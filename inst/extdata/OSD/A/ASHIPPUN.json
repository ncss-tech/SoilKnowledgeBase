  "REVDATE": "01/2011",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashippun series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in the underlying loam till  which contains shale fragments.  These soils are on ground moraines.   Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm(31 inches).   Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
