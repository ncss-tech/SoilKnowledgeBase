These soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium that includes volcanic, granitic, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  The climate is hot arid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 72 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 250 to 325 days."
