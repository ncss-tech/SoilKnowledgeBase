  "OVERVIEW": "The Alta series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Alta soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
