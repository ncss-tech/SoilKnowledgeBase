  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ayresbutte series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from rhyolite with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Ayresbutte soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

They are usually dry, and are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 120 cumulative days following the summer solstice. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick, phosphate retention of 15 to 25 glass and glass-coated aggregate and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent. The particle-size control section averages over 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It contains 15 to 30 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 15 percent rounded cobbles.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It contains 20 to 40 percent rounded gravel and 10 to 20 percent rounded cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam and contains 20 to 35 percent rounded gravel and 20 to 50 percent rounded cobbles and 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It contains 40 to 60 percent rounded gravel and 20 to 40 percent rounded cobbles.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon is very strongly cemented or indurated to a depth of 40 inches or more."
