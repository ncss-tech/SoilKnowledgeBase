    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and thickness of solum range from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ag horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ag horizon is less than 6 inches thick in pedons where the moist value is 3.5 or less.  Texture is loam or silt loam.  Reaction is medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 with a few fine brownish or grayish mottles in most pedons.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Reaction is medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe Btg part of the Btg/Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of 2.5Y, value of 6, and chroma of 2 with brownish or yellowish mottles.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with clay ranging from 20 to 32 percent and silt of more than 20 percent.  The Eg part of the Btg/Eg horizon consists of tongues from 1/2 inch to 4 inches in width of silt loam and clean sand grains extend through this horizon.  The reaction of the Btg/Eg horizon is medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe BCg horizon has similar color and texture as the Btg horizon.  Reaction ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4.  The shale bedrock is tilled more than 20 degrees from horizontal."

Aris, Evadale, and Wrightsville soils have a fine control section.  Basile, Calhoun, Fountain, Frost, Gilbert, Leton, and Verrett soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Bissonnet soils have dominant chromas of 3 or more to a depth of 30 inches and have thicker A horizons.  Caddo, Guyton, and Kinder soils have thicker sola.  Colita, Vimville, and Waller soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Plank soils have coarse-silty control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alikchi soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping surfaces and in slight depressions adjacent to drainageways on uplands in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The regolith is loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam over shale of Pennsylvanian age.  The climate is humid.Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 72 to 80."

Shermore soils are on colluvial footslopes, and Sherwood soils are on low sandstone ridges and have a fine-loamy control section.  Sobol and Tuskahoma soils are on low ridges of shale in mountain valleys, and they are moderately deep and shallow the Cr horizon; and have an E horizon tonguing into the Btg horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
