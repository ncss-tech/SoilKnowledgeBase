  "OVERVIEW": "The Acel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, glaciofluvial, or glaciolacustrine materials.  These soils are on drainageways, lake plains, alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
