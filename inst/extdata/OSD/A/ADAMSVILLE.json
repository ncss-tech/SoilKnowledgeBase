  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Adamsville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils on broad flats, low knolls, and lower side slopes.  They formed in thick sandy marine or eolian sediments in central and southern Florida.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth of sand or fine sand extends to 80 inches, or more. Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A or Ap horizons, and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizons. Silt plus clay content is less than 5 percent in the 10 to 40-inch control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 5.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4. Some pedons have no dominant color and are multicolored in shades of in shades of gray, yellow, and brown. Chroma of 2 or less usually dominate the lower part. Matrix colors are due to uncoated sand grains or thin coatings of organic matter."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Broward, Canaveral, and Satellite series in the same family and the Redlevel series in a closely related family. Broward soils are moderately deep and  Canaveral soils have shell fragments throughout the profile.  Satellite soils have less than 5 percent material that is  less than 0.08 mm in diameter and have very low available water capacity. Redlevel soils are deep to limestone bedrock and are uncoated."

They formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual soil temperature at depths of 20 inches below the surface ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F., The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 54 inches."

Basinger, Bradenton, Elred, Felda, and Ft. Drum Immokalee, Myakka, and Pompano soils are poorly drained.  In addition, Basinger soils have a Bh horizon, Bradenton soils have Bt horizons, Felda soils are arenic, and Ft. Drum soils have Bk horizons, and Elred, Immokalee, and Myakka soils are Spodosols. Delray, Manatee, and Placid soils are very poorly drained.  In addition, Delray soils are grossarenic, Manatee soils have Bt horizons, and Placid soils have umbric epipedons.  St. Lucie soils are excessively drained.  Tavares soils are moderately well drained."
