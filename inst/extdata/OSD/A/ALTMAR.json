  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates is 50 to 200 cm or more. Bedrock is deeper than 152 cm. Content of rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent, by volume, in individual subhorizons above a depth of 102 cm and 0 to 70 percent below 100 cm. The weighted average is more than 10 percent in the 25 to 100 inch section.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture ranges from sandy loam to loamy fine sand and loamy sand with or without gravelly analogues. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence. It ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to sand with or without gravelly analogues. It has very weak granular structure or it is single grain, and has very friable or loose consistence. The B horizon ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is stratified loamy fine sand to sand in the fine earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

The Algansee, Brems, Brockatonorton, Deerfield, Elnora, Livonia, Meckling, Morocco, Ottokee, Tedrow, and Zaborosky soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments as a weighted average in the 25 to 100 cm control section. Birchwood soils have a dense substratum. Fortress soils contain human transported materials. In addition the Deerfield soils have rock fragments dominated by granite, gneiss and quartizite.  The Partridge soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Succotash soils are formed in marine sediments.\nThe Bonaparte, Duane, Fahey, Junius, Otisville, Plymouth, and Stafford series are similar soils in related families. Bonaparte, Otisville, and Plymouth soils lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 100 cm. Duane and Fahey soils have spodic horizons. Junius and Stafford soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less and mottles within a depth of 50 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Altmar soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils in slightly depressions and on moderately low outwash plains, valley terraces, remnant deltas, nearshore zones and along the margins of glacial beach ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils developed in sand and gravel that is dominated by sandstone, with variable but minor amounts of limestone, granite, and shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 609 to 1143 mm. The frost-free season is 120 to 210 days. The elevation ranges from 75 to 215 meters above sea level."

Alton, Arkport and Colonie soils are well drained associates on gravelly and sandy ridges and knolls. Claverack and Collamer soils are in nearby glacio-lacustrine deposits. Madrid, Sodus, Ontario and their wetter associates are on nearby glacial till plains. Wareham soils are poorly drained associates in depressions."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 25cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Aquic subgroup - as evidenced by low chroma mottles within a depth of 40 inches (C2 horizon).\nA phase with a surface layer of human transported materials has been correlated. This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable textures.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data for Altmar and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
