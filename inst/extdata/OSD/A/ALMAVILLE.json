Fragments of chert range from about 0 to 5 percent in each horizon.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid in the Ap, Eg, and Bg horizons, and strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the Btx horizon.\nThe A and Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Some undisturbed pedons have a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) A horizon, 1 to 5 inches thick.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features range from few to common in shades of brown and black.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon  has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma or 2 or less or is neutral.  Many pedons have few to many redoximorphic features in shades of brown and black.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btxg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  The horizon has few to many redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or black.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam."

The soil formed in either silty alluvium or a thick mantle of loess that is underlain in places by clayey limestone residuum.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 58.1 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 53.1 inches."
