  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are stratified with textures ranging from sand to silt.  The control section is coarse-loamy upon mixing.  Organic carbon content varies irregularly with increasing depth.  Depth to a reduced matrix or common or many redox features ranges from 0 to 10 inches. Reaction throughout the profile ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A and AC horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Texture is commonly loam, silt loam and fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, 5G or 5BG; value moist of 4 or 5; chroma moist of 1, or 2.  Texture is stratified and includes fine sandy loam, silt loam and fine sand; occasional pockets and strata of organic materials occur with texture of muck or mucky peat; redoximorphic features occur as a reduced matrix with common or many redoximorphic concentrations in upper Cg horizons.  Redox concentrations have hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 4 through 6.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent well rounded gravel with locally higher concentrations occurring in pockets and lenses."
