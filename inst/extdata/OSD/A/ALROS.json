  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated with stagnant water for at least a few days.  The depths to the upper boundary of the calcic horizon ranges from 18 to 27 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalents in the calcic horizon range from 20 to 50 percent.  Exchangeable sodium percentages, below the surface 12 inches, range from 15 to 42 percent and increases with depth or remains the same.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 18 to 35 percent clay.  The organic matter is less than 1 percent.  Typically, these soils have been altered by land leveling.  There may be weak cementation below 31 inches, with lime-silica durinodes that range from 2 to 12 percent and in layers that range from 3 to 8 inches thick.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 5Y 4/1 or 5/1.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 5Y 3/1 and 3/2.   It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline and may not be calcareous.\nThe upper C horizon is 10YR 7/4, 8/1; 5Y 6/2; or 2.5Y 7/2 dependent on the percentage of lime content.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2; 5Y 4/3, 5/3, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 8/2; 10YR 5/3, 5/6, 7/4 or 8/1.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe lower C horizon is 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2 or 5Y 6/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4; 2.5Y 6/4 or 5GY 5/1.  It is stratified sandy loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and ranges from 15 to 35 percent clay content.  It may be noncalcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alros soils are man-altered soils that have been changed by the use of heavy equipment.  Most Alros soils at one time had natric horizons that have since been removed.  Surface layers of less alkaline soils have been imported or leveled with Alros soils to produce a more productive surface soil.  The origin of both the original and imported soils is mixed alluvium from dominantly granitic sources that has been deposited by the San Joaquin River and its tributaries.  All of this soil has been land leveled but was hummocky in its original landscape.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 90 to 110 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

These soils were previously very poorly drained and ponded with stagnant water during winter and spring months and are now ponded for periods of 2 to 7 days from December to February.  The water table is now 3.5 to 5 feet September through November.  They are now artificially drained or have had their water sources intercepted.  They are protected from major flooding by large flood control levees and reservoirs."

These soils are being differentiated by not having a natric horizon which is characteristic of the Kesterson and Rossi series.  Calcium carbonate equivalent percent determined by double syringe field kit.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  pH determined by colormetric method using Thymol-Blue indicator.  EC determined with saturation extract and solubridge.  ESP by titration.\nLast revised by the state on 1/81.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
