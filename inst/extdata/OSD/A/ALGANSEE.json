Altmar soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Birchwood soils have a densic contact within the series control section. Brems, Deerfield, Elnora, Livonia, Morocco, Ottokee, Succotash, and Tedrow soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth. Brockatonorton soils have a buried organic horizon within the series control section. Fortress soils are in a wetter climate with a mean annual precipitation of more than 1015 mm (40 inches). Meckling soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Partridge soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).
