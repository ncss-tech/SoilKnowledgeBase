Soils are formed from weathered volcanic ash underlain by 100 to 300 thousand year old pahoehoe and `a`a lava flows.  They are found at footslopes and toeslopes in the hillslope profile.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 5000 to over 6000 millimeters (200 to over 240 inches). The mean annual temperature is 15 to 21 degrees C (59 to 69 F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)"
