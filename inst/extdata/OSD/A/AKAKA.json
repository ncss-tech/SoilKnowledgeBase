  "OVERVIEW": "The Akaka series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash. Akaka soils are in ash fields on mid elevation, windward slopes of Mauna Kea volcano. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5840 millimeters (230 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
