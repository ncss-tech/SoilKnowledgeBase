  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The water table is close enough to the surface that the upper horizons are always moist.  The soil may be flooded by sea water at high tide or during high stream flows coinciding with high tides.  The mean soil temperature is about 57 degrees F, the average July soil temperature is about 59 degrees F and the average January soil temperature is about 52 degrees F.  Fine stratification is absent from the upper part of the profile.  Coarse stratification is common and the organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon is less than 7 inches thick or has less than 1 percent organic matter after mixing to 7 inches.  Distinct or prominent mottles are in or immediately below the A horizon.  This horizon is gray to dark gray and is neutral or has 10YR or 5Y hue.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe upper part of the C horizon ranges from light gray to greenish gray (5Y and 5GY hues) with distinct to prominent, brown to olive mottles (7.5YR and 5Y hues).  It is silty clay loam to silty clay and usually is stratified with thin layers of organic material and lenses of coarser textured material.  The 10 to 40 inch section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and is calcareous in some pedons.  The lower part of the C horizon has strong gley colors in 5GY, 5Bg or 5B hue.  It ranges from silty clay to sand, but is usually sandy.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bayside, Coquille, Maria, Reyes, Sycamore, Temple, and Valdez series.  Bayside soils do not have a water table within a foot of the surface most of the time and are not flushed by sea water.  Coquille soils are strongly acid.  Maria soils are calcareous throughout.  Reyes soils are strongly acid, are high in sulfur, and become extremely acid upon oxidation.  Sycamore soils have chroma of 2 or more throughout and lack colors indicative of intense reduction.  Temple soils have a mean soil temperature of more than 59 degrees F.  Valdez soils lack dark A horizons and have less than 35 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Alviso soils occur near sea level in level basins and tidal flats with branched meandering channels that are flushed by sea water and varying amounts of fresh water.  They formed in alluvium dominantly from sedimentary rocks.  The climate is subhumid, mesothermal with cool foggy summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual rainfall is 12 to 21 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, average January temperature about 49 degrees F, and average July temperature about 57 to 59 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 330 to 365 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Antioch, Camarillo, Clear Lake, Pescadero, and Tamba soils and the competing Reyes soils.  Antioch soils lack high water table and mottles.  Camarillo soils have no mottles above depth of 20 inches.  Clear Lake soils have cracks and slickensides.  Pescadero soils have natric horizons.  Tamba soils are strongly acid."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soils were formerly classified as Low Humic Gray soils.\nThe classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as Fine, mixed, nonacid, isomesic Tropic Fluvaquents. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nLast major revision by the state on 5/72.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
