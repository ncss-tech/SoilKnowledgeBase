  "OVERVIEW": "The Adamson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that\nformed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Adamson soils are on stream\nterraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  Permeability is moderate\nto 28 inches and very rapid below.  The average annual precipitation is\nabout 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42\ndegrees F.",
