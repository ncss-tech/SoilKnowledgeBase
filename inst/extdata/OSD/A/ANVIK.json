  "OVERVIEW": "The Anvik series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Anvik soils are on alluvial fans and valley filling side slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
