  "OVERVIEW": "The Armpup series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The Armpup soils are on pediment remnants and ballena toe slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
