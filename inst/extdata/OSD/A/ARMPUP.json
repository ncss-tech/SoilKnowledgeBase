Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is typical of the Mojave Desert, with hot dry summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is between 3 to 6 inches; mean annual temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 210 to 220 days."
