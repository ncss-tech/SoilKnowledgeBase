  "OVERVIEW": "The Americus series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on uplands.  These soils have dark reddish brown loamy sand A horizons and dark red loamy sand and sandy loam Bt horizons that extend to depths of more than 6 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 72 inches.  All horizons are strongly acid or very strongly acid unless limed.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 10R, value of 3, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Values of dry soil are l unit or less higher than that of moist soil.   The Bt1 and Bt2 horizons are loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  The Bt3 horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages between 8 and 14 percent clay and less than 10 percent silt."

Competing series in other families are the Anniston, Bienville, Blanton, Claiborne, Eustis, Kenansville, Lucedale, Lucy, Molena, Pine Flat, Red Bay, Troup, and Wagram series.  Anniston soils have kaolinitic clay mineralogy and average more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Bienville, Blanton, Eustis, Lucy, Troup, and Wagram soils have argillic horizons with dry color values of 5 or more.  In addition, Lucy, Troup, and Wagram soils have a kandic horizon and have sandy clay loam Bt horizons.  Claiborne soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 59 degrees F., and have more than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt.  Kenansville soils have sola of less than 40 inches thick.  Lucedale and Red Bay soils have more than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Molena soils have sola 40 to 72 inches thick and mixed mineralogy.  Pine Flat soils are sandy loam in the upper part of the Bt horizon."

Elevation is 150 to 500 feet.  The soil formed in unconsolidated sandy sediment.  Mean annual air temperature is about 60 to 70 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 55 inches."
