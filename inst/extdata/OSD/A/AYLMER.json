Some pedons have an Ab horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry.  It commonly is sand, but some is fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sand or fine sand.  Some pedons have a fine textured 2C horizon below a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clearriver, Hiwood, Lino, Meehan, Perchlake, Poppleton, Redby, Rushlake, Sciota and Winterfield series. Clearriver and Perchlake soils have a thin zone of clay accumulation (Bt) in the series control section.  Hiwood, Lino, Meehan, Poppleton and Redby soils have a wetter climate and have redoximorphic features higher in the profile. Rushlake soils have rock fragments in the series control section.  Sciota soils are in areas of higher precipitation and are substantially wetter in the soil moisture control section during the growing season.  Winterfield soils have a higher mean annual precipitation and an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with increasing depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aylmer soils are on nearly level to gently undulating wind outwash plains and delta plains.  Slopes are plane, concave, and convex.  Slope gradient range from 0 to 6 percent.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 23 inches.  Most of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer."

Fossum, Hamar and Ulen soils are on nearby low basins and swales.  Hecla and Maddock soils are on nearby nearly level and undulating areas.  Serden soils do not have redoximorphic features.  Serden soils are on nearby higher positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In the mid 1950's and 1960's, a soil similar to Aylmer (Bantry) was used in McHenry County, North Dakota.  That Bantry series was dropped (prior to the establishment of the Aylmer series in 1975) and part of its concept included in the Serden series.  The current Bantry series, established in 1987, represents a soil that is wetter than the Aylmer series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
