  "OVERVIEW": "The Aladshi series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Aladshi soils are on the distal parts of fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
