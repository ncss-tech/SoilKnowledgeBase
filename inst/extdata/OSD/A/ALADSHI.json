Igert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Mimentor, Nevador, and Wedlar soils do not have identifiable secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon and do not have horizons which are firm and brittle when moist. Qwynn soils are not intermittently moist during summer months and lack Bk horizons above the argillic horizon. Wedertz soils do not have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon and have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
