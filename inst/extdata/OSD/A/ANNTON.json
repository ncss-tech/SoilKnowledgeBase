  "OVERVIEW": "The Annton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy, calcareous, friable till and in the underlying firm till. These soils are on convex slopes on ground moraines or till plains. Slope ranges from 3 to 18 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",

This structure is evident in pits and cutbanks and rarely observed by smaller scale investigations. The change in moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.65 g/cc was based on lab data of soils that are similar and field investigations by soil scientist in this geomorphic landform of the Coteau des Prairies bench\".\nBased on current investigations, elevation ranges in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meter above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296, has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006."
