Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface\n2. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 cm. (A1 and A2 horizons)\n3. Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm. (CA, Cg1, and Cg2 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference sample 2011RI009028, by the University of Rhode Island, 2011 is the typical pedon.  Additional reference samples include pedons 2011RI009031, 2011RI009016, 2011RI009004, 2011RI009038, 2011RI007004, 2011RI009025, 2011RI009034, 2011RI009039;  by the University of Rhode Island,  2011.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
