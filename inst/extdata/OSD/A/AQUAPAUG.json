  "OVERVIEW": "The Aquapaug series consists of subaqueous soils permanently submerged beneath 0 to about 3 meters of water on submerged outwash landscapes of freshwater ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. These soils formed in over 100 cm. of sandy outwash material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters.",
