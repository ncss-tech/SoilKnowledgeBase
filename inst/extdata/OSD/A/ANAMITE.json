  "REVDATE": "04/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Anamite series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately fine and fine textured silty water-deposited sediment primarily from rhyolitic rock but containing lesser amounts of material from felsitic and basaltic rocks and limestone.  Anamite soils are on very level, smooth plains that are believed to be relic beds of shallow lakes and have slopes typically less than 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.",
