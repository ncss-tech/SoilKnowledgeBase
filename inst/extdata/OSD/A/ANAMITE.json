    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Anamite soils are on very level, smooth plains that are believed to be relic beds of shallow lakes. Slopes are typically less than 1 percent. The regolith is moderately fine and fine textured silty water-deposited sediment primarily from rhyolitic rock but containing lesser amounts of material from felsitic and basaltic rocks and limestone. The climate is semiarid continental. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 58 degrees F."
