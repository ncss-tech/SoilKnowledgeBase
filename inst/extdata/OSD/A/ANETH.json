  "OVERVIEW": "The Aneth series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian deposits and alluvium derived from sandstone. Aneth soils are on valley bottoms, fan terraces, and toeslopes. Slopes are 0 to 16 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
