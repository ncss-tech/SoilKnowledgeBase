It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence. The type location was moved to the taxonomic unit description (TUD) in the Multnomah County, Oregon, manuscript. It could not be determined why the TUD type location was different than that of the OSD. The Multnomah County TUD had the same pedon profile description as the OSD; thus, it appeared to be a better location. The type location in the unedited OSD read \"Multnomah County, Oregon, along Cougar Creek Road; in the NW1/4NW1/4 of section 17, T. 1 S., R. 6 E.\" The GIS roads layer for Multnomah County did not have a Cougar Creek Road.\n6/1998--Classification changed from loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Andic Haplumbrepts to loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Andic Dystrudepts. Additional data on andic soil properties is needed to confirm the classification of the andic subgroup or Andisols order. The frigid counterpart of this series is the Zygore series; it should also be investigated.\nIt is not known when the classification was changed from Dystrudepts to Humudepts."
