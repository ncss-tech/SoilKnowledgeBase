  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches becomes moist in some part in November or early December and remains moist until May.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 63 degrees F.  The solum includes up to 20 percent gravel by volume.  It is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 4/2, 5/1, 4/1, 3/1; 2.5Y 5/2 and 4/2.  Organic matter is more than 1.2 percent to a depth of more than 4 inches.  Texture is typically clay loam but includes silt loam and silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4; 2.5Y 4/2 and 5/2.  It is clay or sandy clay.\nThe Cr horizon is 7.5YR 6/6; 10YR 6/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 5/4.  It is consolidated gravelly fine textured sediments, and soft shale, or sandstone, and is slightly calcareous in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Azule soils are on hills and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent.  They formed from moderately fine textured consolidated alluvium and soft shale and fine grained sandstone.  Elevations are 100 to 2,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  Average January temperature is 48 degrees F; average July temperature is 68 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 250 to 320 days."

Altamont and Diablo soils are clayey throughout, crack widely on drying and have intersecting slickensides.  Hillgate, Pleasanton and Positas soils lack a paralithic contact.  Hillgate and Positas soils also have an abrupt A-B horizon boundary."
