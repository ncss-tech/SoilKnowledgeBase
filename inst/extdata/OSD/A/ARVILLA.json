  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sand and gravel ranges from 14 to 25 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 13 to 25 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  When it is 16 or more inches thick, it has a sandy particle size class in the major part.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB or BA horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  It is loamy sand in the lower part of some pedons.  It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a gravelly loamy sand or gravelly loamy coarse sand 2Bw horizon.  Some pedons have a coarse sand 2BC horizon.\nThe Bk, where present, and the 2Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The Bk horizon is loamy sand, sand, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  The 2Bk horizon is sand, coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand, gravelly sand or very gravelly coarse sand.  It has more than 5 percent gravel, but commonly averages 20 to 35 percent gravel.  The 2Bk horizon is expressed as the presence of carbonate accumulations on the underside of pebbles.  The Bk and 2Bk horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.  It has more than 5 percent gravel, but commonly averages 20 to 35 percent gravel.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Binford and Sverdrup series in the same family and the Lohnes, Maddock and Sioux series.  Binford soils have sand and gravel 2C horizons that have more than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction.  Sverdrup soils contain less than 5 percent rock fragments and do not have coarse sand and gravel 2C horizons.  Lohnes soils have loamy coarse sand or coarse sand in the series control section.  Maddock soils are dominated by fine sand and have less than 2 percent rock fragments.  Sioux soils do not have a cambic horizon and have sand and gravel within depths of 14 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arvilla soils are on level to moderately steep outwash plains, beach areas of glacial lakes, and terraces of glacial stream valleys.  Slope gradients are commonly 1 to 5 percent, but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in a thin mantle of sandy loam alluvium underlain by thick beds of loose sand and gravel.  The climate is cool, subhumid with a mean annual air temperature ranging from 36 to 48 degrees F, and a mean annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 24 inches.  Three-fourths of the rainfall is in the spring and summer."

The Divide, Osakis and Wyrene soils are on lower level and slight concave depressions in the outwash plains.  Sioux soils are on the steeper hills and ridges.  Fordville and Renshaw soils have more than 18 percent clay in the upper part.  In addition Fordville soils are pachic."
