  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan is 15 to 30 inches. Rock fragments of shale, siltstone, sandstone, and in some pedons, quartzite gravel range from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the solum, from 10 to 30 percent in the lower part of the solum, and from 10 to 65 percent in the C horizon. The reaction in unlimed soils ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt and Btg horizons have hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 in the upper part (Bt) and value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 in the lower part (Btg). It has textures of loam, silt loam and silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4, or is neutral with value of 4 or 5. It has textures of loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It has textures of loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a C horizon. It has hue 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It has textures of loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Buckingham, Portville (T), Ravenna and Venango soils are in the same family. Gresham soils were formerly in the same family but have not been updated to the 10th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. All these series are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock. Additionally, Buckingham and Gresham soils have sola greater than 60 inches. Portville, Ravenna and Venango soils have B horizons with hue yellower than 5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Abbottstown soils are on nearly level to sloping concave upland flats, depressions and drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. They formed in residuum weathered from noncalcareous red shale, siltstone, and fine-grain sandstone. Climate is humid and temperate, with mean annual precipitation of 40 to 48 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., and the growing season ranges from 170 to 200 days."

Bucks, Klinesville and Penn soils are all well drained. Klinesville soils have bedrock within 20 inches and Penn soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface. Croton and Doylestown soils are poorly drained. Lawrenceville and Readington soils are moderately well drained. Chalfont soils have B horizon colors yellower than 5YR. Reaville soils do not have a fragipan."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 2/2002 revision places Abbottstown soils in an active family based on similar geographically associated soils such as Readington and Reaville. Competing series and redoximorphic features were also revised. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches.\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 30 inches (Bt and Btg horizons).\nc. Fragipan - the zone from 19 to 30 inches (Btxg horizon).\nd. Lithic contact - slightly weathered shale bedrock at 59 inches (R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: No characterization pedons are available for this series at the National Soil Survey Laboratory.\nMLRA = 148\nREVISED: 3/89-EJM, EAW; 5/2001-EMJ, EAW; 2/2002-DHK; EJM-EAW 2/2002\n2006: Pedon Description and type location updated\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
