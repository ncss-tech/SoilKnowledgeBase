  "OVERVIEW": "The Ansel series consists of deep and very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium on alluvial fan aprons and footslopes.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Castelleia soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments above a depth of 100 cm.  Edloe, Limber, Sapphire, Schofield, Shule, Swapps, and Woodrock soils have a lithic contact above a depth of 100 cm.  Erickson soils have a strongly acid Bt horizon.  Grimstone, Indart, Perceton, Polvadera, and Tongue River soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 100 cm.   Hierro and Uinta soils have a Bt horizon with hue redder then 7.5YR.  Lick, Peeler, and Swifton soils have a thick E&B horizon between the E and Bt horizons.  Tahoma soils lack an E horizon. Trapper and Whitefish soils have a continuous horizon of carbonate accumulation."
