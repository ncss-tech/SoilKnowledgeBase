  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent but are usually less than 15 percent and consist of small, flat fragments, pebbles, and cobbles. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperatures ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 60 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 7.5YR.  It is typically a loam or very fine sandy loam but may be a fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

Castelleia soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments above a depth of 40 inches.  Edloe, Limber, Sapphire, Schofield, Shule, Swapps, and Woodrock soils have a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Erickson soils have a strongly acid Bt horizon.  Grimstone, Indart, Perceton, Polvadera, and Tongue River soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.   Hierro and Uinta soils have a Bt horizon with hue redder then 7.5YR.  Lick, Peeler, and Swifton soils have a thick E&B horizon between the E and Bt horizons.  Tahoma soils lack an E horizon. Trapper and Whitefish soils have a continuous horizon of carbonate accumulation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ansel soils are on alluvial fan aprons and footslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial deposits derived from schist, granite, and gneiss.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. but will range from 33 to 43 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 9,500 feet.  The frost-free season is less than 80 days."
