The soil is saturated to the surface, probably by the capillary fringe at least part of the time in October thru May.  Mottles with chroma of 4,6 or 8 occur throughout.\nThe A and 2Ab horizons have dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/1, or 5Y 4/1, and moist colors of 7.5YR 3/2, 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, or 5Y 4/1.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 4/1 or 5Y 4/1 and moist colors of 10YR 2/1, 3/2, 3/2, 3/4 or 7.5YR 3/2.

The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 58 to 61 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 220 to 235 days."
