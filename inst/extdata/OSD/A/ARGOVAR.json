The soil is saturated to the surface, probably by the capillary fringe at least part of the time in October thru May.  Mottles with chroma of 4,6 or 8 occur throughout.\nThe A and 2Ab horizons have dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/1, or 5Y 4/1, and moist colors of 7.5YR 3/2, 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, or 5Y 4/1.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 4/1 or 5Y 4/1 and moist colors of 10YR 2/1, 3/2, 3/2, 3/4 or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent.\nThe 3Bt horizon has dry color of 5Y 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, and moist color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, or 6/4.  It has dry color in the lower part of 7.5YR 6/8, 10YR 5/6, 5Y 5/8, 5/6, 4/4, 7/4 and moist color of 7.5YR 5/8, 10YR 4/6, 5Y 4/8, 4/6, 4/4, 6/4.  It has mottles with chroma of 1.  Clay content ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  There is a 25 to 35 percent absolute clay increase from the 2Bt to the 3Bt horizon.  Reaction is neutral.  Base saturation is 75 to 90 percent."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Argovar soils are in mountain meadows and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in material from gabbrodiorite.  The A, 2Ab, and 2Bt horizons are slope alluvium deposited on the 3B horizons which weathered from parent rock.  A stone line separates the two layers.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 58 to 61 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 220 to 235 days."
