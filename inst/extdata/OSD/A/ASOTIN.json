  "OVERVIEW": "The Asotin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and colluvium from basalt together with minor amounts of volcanic ash. Asotin soils are on canyon hillslopes and have slopes of 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
