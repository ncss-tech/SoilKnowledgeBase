The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days. The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and averages 0 to 20 percent basalt fragments. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is gravelly silt loam or silt loam.

Asotin soils formed in loess, and colluvium from basalt together with minor amounts of volcanic ash. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The mean January temperature is 30 to 34 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free season is 135 to 160 days."

Kuhl and Lickskillet soils have bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches And are on plateaus and canyon slopes. Schuelke soils are loamy-skeletal and are on canyon slopes. Spofford soils have natric horizons and are on plateaus and hills. Oliphant and Walla Walla soils are coarse-silty and are more than 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Oliphant soils are on plateaus and Walla Walla soils are on hills."
