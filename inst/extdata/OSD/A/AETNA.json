Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 inches) of recent light colored alluvium and are underlain by a buried Aquoll formed in glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F)."

Of these soils, only the poorly drained Killbuck soils formed in recent alluvium over a buried soil. Eldean, Ockley, Sleeth, Thackery, Lippincott, and Westland soils are formed in outwash and are on nearby terraces. Nearby soils formed in glacial till include the series which are members of the Miamian and Amanda drainage sequence."
