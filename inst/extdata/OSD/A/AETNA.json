  "OVERVIEW": "The Aetna series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium over glaciolacustrine deposits on flood plains, terraces, and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
