Many areas which were formally cultivated are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation. The native vegetation is mixed coniferous and deciduous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, white spruce, white pine, quaking aspen, paper birch, and bur oak.  Common understory vegetation includes American hazel, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, big leaf aster, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."
