  "OVERVIEW": "The Arboretum series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in deposits derived from benmoreite, or dacite. Arboretum soils are on playa, alluvium, or slope alluvium deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
