    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Agust (TX), Cronese (CA), Grapevine (NV), Guijarral (CA), Kinley (AZ), Nikey (UT), Rillino (AZ), Whitlock (AZ) and Yipin (NM), series. Agust and Rillino soils contain less than 18 percent clay throughout the profile. Cronese, Grapevine, and Kinley soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and Guijarral soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17), all these soils receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November. Nikey soils have 20 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles. Yipin soils have cambic horizons. Whitlock soils overly sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Algerita soils are on level basin floors and on gently sloping alluvial fan-piedmonts of late or mid-Pleistocene age.  Elevations are 4,200 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 3 percent or less in most places, but in some areas the soils have been dissected and ridges are the dominant landscape feature.  These soils formed in sandy sediments, mostly of mixed lithology with little or no gravel.  The annual air temperature ranges from about 58 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The annual precipitation ranges from about 7 to 10 inches with a pronounced summer maximum."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nADDITIONAL DATA: S61 N Mex. 7-2, Lincoln Lab. 14936-14946 (L.H.
