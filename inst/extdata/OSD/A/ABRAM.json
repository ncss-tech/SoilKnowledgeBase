  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 3 to 25 cm. The layer of mineral soil directly above the bedrock is more than one third of the total soil thickness.\nTexture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragments are 0 to 35 percent by volume throughout the mineral soil and are mainly angular gravel. Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 3 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. It is moderately or highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has weak fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 6. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe bedrock is generally granite, phyllite, schist, or gneiss."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Abram soils are on the crests and side slopes of bedrock controlled ridges and mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent but is typically 8 to 40 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of glacial till derived mainly from granite, phyllite, schist and gneiss. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1270 mm and the mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 8 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days. Elevations range from 2 to 762 meters above mean sea level in Maine and Vermont and up to 975 meters in New York."

Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock in convex positions. All these other soils have thicker sola, and are generally in valleys and on lower side slopes."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n1. The Abram series includes soils formerly mapped with rock land and very rocky phases of Lyman and Canaan soils.\n2. A major inclusion in mapping will be soils that lack a spodic horizon.\n3. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Albic horizon - the zone from 3 to 5 cm (E horizon).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 5 to 13 cm (Bhs and Bs horizons).\nc. Lithic contact - hard bedrock at 13 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record Numbers for the Abram Series are: Abram, ME0115; Abram, stony, ME0131; and Abram, bouldery, ME0140.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
