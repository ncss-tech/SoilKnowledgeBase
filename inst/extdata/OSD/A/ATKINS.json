  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 50 inches. The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Unless limed, this soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid and ranges to moderately acid below a depth of 40 inches. Rock fragments are commonly absent, but may range from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent by volume in the C horizon.\nThe A, Ap, and AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redoximorphic features have hue of 5Y to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is loam or silt loam, and less commonly fine sandy loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon (here intended to include BA and BC horizons, where present) is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Redoximorphic features have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Soft manganese and iron masses occur in some pedons and have hue 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. The B horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and less commonly sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5PB, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 8. The C horizon may be stratified; it is loam, clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have a 2C horizon of sand and gravel below 3 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atkins soils are on nearly level soils of flood plains. Slopes are concave or linear and range from 0 to 3 percent. Atkins soils formed in alluvium washed mainly from upland soils derived from interbedded acid sandstones and shales. Average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 55 inches and average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 57 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elkins, Monongahela, Philo, Pope and Tygart soils. Elkins soils are very poorly drained and have a thick black or very dark gray A horizon. The Monongahela and Tygart soils are on terraces and have argillic horizons. Philo soils are moderately well drained soils on flood plains. Pope soils are well drained soils on flood plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: This soil is poorly drained. The water table is a foot or less below the soil surface for appreciable periods. Internal drainage is very slow.  Permeability is slow to moderate in the subsoil and ranges to moderately rapid in the substratum. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Occasional flooding is typical on the Atkins landform.  The mechanism of flooding usually involves shallow standing or slowly moving water on the soil surface."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are wooded or pastured. Vegetation is mixed hardwood forest of water tolerant oaks, red maples, black gum, sweet gum, willow, elm, ash, and alder; with aquatic grasses and sedges in places.  Many areas originally mapped as Atkins have been filled in, and in subsequent decades developed for urban uses."
