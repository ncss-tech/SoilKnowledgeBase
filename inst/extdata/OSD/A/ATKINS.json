  "OVERVIEW": "The Atkins series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in acid alluvium washed from upland soils that formed in shale and sandstone. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to low. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1150 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 64 to 127 centimeters. The depth to bedrock is greater than 150 centimeters. Unless limed, this soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid and ranges to moderately acid below a depth of 40 inches. Rock fragments are commonly absent, but may range from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent by volume in the C horizon.\nThe A, Ap, and AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redoximorphic features have hue of 5Y to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is loam or silt loam, and less commonly fine sandy loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon (here intended to include BA and BC horizons, where present) is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Redoximorphic features have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Soft manganese and iron masses occur in some pedons and have hue 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. The B horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and less commonly sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5PB, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 8. The C horizon may be stratified; it is loam, clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have a 2C horizon of sand and gravel below 1 meter."

Average annual precipitation ranges from 950 to 1400 millimeters and average annual temperature ranges from 8 to 13.8 degrees C."

Elkins soils are very poorly drained and have a thick black or very dark gray A horizon. The Monongahela and Tygart soils are on terraces and have argillic horizons. Philo soils are moderately well drained soils on flood plains. Pope soils are well drained soils on flood plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: This soil is poorly drained. The water table is less than 30 centimeters below the soil surface for appreciable periods. Internal drainage is very slow. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to low in the subsoil and ranges to moderately high in the substratum. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Occasional to frequent flooding is typical on the Atkins landform.  The mechanism of flooding usually involves shallow standing or slowly moving water on the soil surface."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are wooded or pastured. Vegetation is mixed hardwood forest of water tolerant oaks, red maples, black gum, sweet gum, willow, elm, ash, and alder; with aquatic grasses and sedges in places.  Many areas originally mapped as Atkins have been filled in, and in subsequent decades developed for urban uses."
