  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alpineco soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  They formed in till derived from mixed rocks and colluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches, the mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability (high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table occurring somewhere between 24 and 40 inches (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from April to June. Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory. The water table only occurs in spring and early summer during melting of winter snowpack when water moves laterally above the bedrock."
