  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Adaven soils occur on smooth, nearly level toe of alluvial fans where they merge with wet flood plains and have slope gradients of 0 to 2 percent slopes.  They have formed in sediment from mixed sources including limestone and ignimbrite.  The sediments have been modified by evaporation of water from hot springs having a high lime content.  Elevations are 915 to 1,220 meters.  The climate is arid with a mean annual precipitation of 125 to 175 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C. The frost free season is about 170 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Adaven soils occur in the same general area as Ash Springs, Carrizo, Geer, Maynard Lake, Pahranagat, and Seaman.  Carrizo soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Maynard Lake soils have sandy particle-size control sections.  Geer and Seaman soils are well drained and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Pahranagat soils are poorly drained and have mollic epipedons."

The water table varies seasonally about 76 cm during most of the year and rising to within 46 cm during the winter months when the vegetation is dormant."
