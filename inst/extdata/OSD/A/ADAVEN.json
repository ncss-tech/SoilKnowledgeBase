  "OVERVIEW": "The Adaven series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sediments derived from mixed rocks and pyroclastic material. Adaven soils are on floodplains and toe slopes of fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",

They have formed in sediment from mixed sources including limestone and ignimbrite.  The sediments have been modified by evaporation of water from hot springs having a high lime content.  Elevations are 915 to 1,220 meters.  The climate is arid with a mean annual precipitation of 125 to 175 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C. The frost free season is about 170 days."

Geer and Seaman soils are well drained and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Pahranagat soils are poorly drained and have mollic epipedons."
