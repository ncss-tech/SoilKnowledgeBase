The soils are saturated with water during some period of the year within 100 cm of the surface. Depth to the seasonal water table ranges from 75 to 175 cm or more.\nMean annual soil temperature: 8.5 to 13.5 degrees C.\nOrganic matter content: Decreases irregularly with depth or remains above .35 percent to a depth of 125 cm.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 35 percent.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nOther features: The soils have chroma of 1 if not mottled, or chroma of 2 or less with mottles at some depth between 50 and 100 cm.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent.\nSand content: averages less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma: 2 or 3 (The surface 10 cm has dry value of less than 5.5 and moist value of less than 3.5 in some pedons.)\nC horizon\nHue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist.\nChroma: 1 through 3.\nTexture: Silty clay to silt loam but averages silty clay loam; below 100cm ranges from silty clay to sand.\nReaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline."

They formed in alluvium from limestone, shale and sandstone. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 150 to 300 mm. Freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."

(Ap1 and part of the Ap2 horizons)\nAquic feature: Redox depletions and aquic conditions for some time within 100 cm in depth.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C2,C3,C4 and part of the C1 and C5 horizons).\nThe active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data.\nRevision April 2009 changes the classification from Aquic Xerofluvents to Aquic Torrifluvents to better fit the moisture class where mapped.\nThis series has been used where the water table is below 100 cm in some map units. Unless drained, these areas are outside the taxonomic class and concept of the series and should be reviewed for possible correlation to other soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
