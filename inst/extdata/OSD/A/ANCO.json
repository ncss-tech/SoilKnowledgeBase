  "OVERVIEW": "The Anco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Anco soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",

Unless drained, these areas are outside the taxonomic class and concept of the series and should be reviewed for possible correlation to other soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
