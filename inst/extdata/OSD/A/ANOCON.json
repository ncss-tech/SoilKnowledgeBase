  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The range in solum thickness is 60 to about 80 inches.\nThe A horizon has colors in hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam or loam. The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have an AB or BA horizon. It has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, and slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has colors in hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma 4 to 8. Mottles of these colors range from none to common and from faint to distinct. Grayish mottles are below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay with clay content of control section averaging from 35 to 45 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline and is typically noncalcareous.\nThe BCt horizon has colors in shades of red, yellow, or brown. It is typically mottled with these colors. Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam. Concretions of calcium carbonate and gypsum crystals range from none to common. The reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a C horizon between 60 and 80 inches that is shale or weakly consolidated sandstone interbedded with shale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Frankirk, Lawton, Ren and Scullin series. Frankirk soils are drier for longer periods and lack mottles in the Bt horizon. Lawton soils lack mottles in the Bt horizon and contain granitic sand and pebbles in the lower Bt horizon. Ren soils are moderately deep over Permian redbed shales and are in slightly cooler climates. Scullin soils have sola less than 40 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on gently sloping plains. Slopes are mainly 1 to 5 percent but range to 8 percent. These soils formed in slope wash and slope alluvium from sandstone and shale. The average annual temperature is 64 to 65 degrees F.; the average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches. Frost free period is 220 to 230 days and elevation ranges from 1000 to 1200 feet. The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 44 to 50."

Stoneburg soils have fine loamy control sections and are on similar positions in the landscape. Truce soils lack a mollic epipedon and are on similar or slightly lower positions. Vernon soils are clayey throughout and on slightly higher positions. Waurika soils have albic horizons, are dominated by gray colors, and occur on slightly lower positions."
