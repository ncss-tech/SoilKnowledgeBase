  "OVERVIEW": "The Arclay series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granite. The Arclay soils are on sideslopes and crests of mountains and foothills. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
