  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  There are many distinct and prominent mottles of bright and dull chroma usually within an 18 inch depth.  The particle size control section is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent is usually 2 to 5 percent in most of the control section, but increases to 10 or 12 percent in some horizons. Calcium sulfate is usually about 2 percent in the lower part of the control section but ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual soil temperature is 51 to 57 degrees F., the average summer soil temperature ranges from 66 to 76 degrees F.  The control section is usually clay but ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 25 percent sand.  Fluctuating water tables occur in these soils in some season of some years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR."

The soils formed in alluvial parent materials derived from mixed rock sources.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 16 inches, of which 8 to 10 inches falls during the months of April through August.  The frost-free season is 135 to 170 days."
