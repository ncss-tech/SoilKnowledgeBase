  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid throughout.  Fine flakes of mica range from common to many throughout.  Clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 60 percent to about 80 percent.  Organic carbon content is more than 0.2 percent at depths of 50 inches or more.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where the value is 3.5 or less, thickness is less than 10 inches.  Redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray range from few to common.  Pressure faces on surfaces of peds range from few to common.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value 3 through 5, and chroma 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red range from few to many.  Slickensides on surfaces of peds range from few to many.  Texture is clay.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon lacks a matrix color and is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red range from common to many.  Slickensides on surfaces of peds range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay or clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known series in the same family.  Series in closely related families include the Chastain, Chenneby, and Tawcaw series.  Chastain soils are on similar positions and have a mixed mineralogy control section.  The somewhat poorly drained Chenneby soils are on similar positions but have a fine-silty control section.  The somewhat poorly drained Tawcaw soils are on similar positions but have a fine-loamy, kaolinitic control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual temperature is about ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 54 to 58 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Bethera, Dothan, Duplin, Eulonia, Faceville, Fuquay, Hornsville, Iuka, and Orangeburg series.  Bethera soils are on similar flood plain to higher terrace positions and have more developed subsoils. Dothan, Duplin, Faceville, Fuquay, and Orangeburg soils are on adjacent higher upland positions and have well developed argillic horizons.  In addition, the well drained Dothan soils have more than 5 percent plinthite in the subsoil, Duplin soils are moderately well drained, The well drained Faceville and Orangeburg soils have red subsoils, and the well drained Fuquay soils have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches thick and more than 5 percent plinthite in the subsoil.  The moderately well drained Eulonia and Hornsville soils are on higher adjacent stream terraces.  The moderately well drained Iuka soils are on slightly higher flood plain positions near stream channels in the flood plain and have coarse-loamy control sections."
