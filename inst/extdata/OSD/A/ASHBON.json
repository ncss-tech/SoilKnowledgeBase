Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, with an understory of bunchgrass.  Some lesser sloping areas are used for range.  The principle vegetation in these areas are Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, needleandthread, prairie junegrass, and big sagebrush."
