  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to fractured limestone bedrock or limestone interbedded with clayey marls ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Limestone fragments and stones, and chert fragments of pebble and cobble size range from 1 to 20 percent of the soil volume or on the soil surface. Gilgai microrelief is indistinct but slickensides and wedge-shaped aggregates are common below 12 inch depths. The soil is usually moist, but when dry it has cracks ranging from .5 to 2 inches wide. Cracks remain open from 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years. The soil texture is clay and clay content ranges from 60 to 80 percent. The reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5 YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma 2 or 3. Texture is usually clay but some pedons are clay loam in the upper 6 inches.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value 3 or 4, and chroma 2 to 6. Some pedons have few to common masses, concretions, or pendants of secondary calcium carbonate on coarse fragments in lower 6 inches of the Bss horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is extremely weakly cemented to moderately cemented limestone or chalk that is interbedded with marl in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Vertel is the only series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Crawford, Dalco, Greenvine, San Saba, Vertel, Depalt, and Crawford series that have fine particle size class.  Greenvine soils have a paralithic contact to siltstone. San Saba and Dalco soils have hue of 10YR or yellower. Vertel soils have a paralithic contact to shale and hue of 10YR or yellower. Depalt soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Anhalt soils are on uplands. Slope gradients are mainly less than 2 percent and range from 0 to 3 percent. It is presumed these soils are formed in residuum from weathered limestone and chalk of the Glenrose Formation.  The frost free days range from 230 to 240. Elevation ranges from 1200 to 2200 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 32 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 63 to 70 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 32 to 50."

Denton soils contain over 40 percent calcium carbonate Doss soils are less than 20 inches to limestone and have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the B horizon. Crawford, Depalt, Hensley, Lindy, Speck, and Spires soils occur in similar surfaces. Denton and Doss soils occur at lower elevations."
