  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in loamy recent alluvium weathered  from Tyee sandstone and basalt. The climate is  characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers tempered by an influence of marine air and low clouds due to the proximity of the Pacific Ocean.   The mean annual precipitation  is 55 to  70 inches, which occurs mostly as rain during the winter months. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nMollic (Pachic) epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 25 inches (Ap1, Ap2, AB, Bw1 horizons)\nCambic horizon - from 16 to 34 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons)\nCumulic feature - pachic epipedon and irregular decrease in organic carbon content\nUltic feature - base saturation of less than 75 percent in one or more horizons between depths of 10 to 30 inches (AB, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)\nOxyaquic feature - redox features occur at a depth of 34 inches (BC horizon), indicating the presence of a fluctuating water table which saturates this horizon and those below for more than 20 consecutive days or 30 cumulative days.\nParticle-size control section  the zone from 10 to 40 inches\nThe Alsea soils occur on both the high and low Winkle geomorphic surfaces as recognized in the Willamette Valley, Oregon.  Those soils associated with the low Winkle surface have a rare flooding hazard.\nThe Alsea series was originally mapped as having a udic moisture in the initial soil survey of the Alsea Area, Oregon (published 1968). With the recent update mapping of Benton County, Oregon Soil Survey the typical pedon for this soil was relocated based on further field observations and documentation to reflect a modal concept which is very deep, has a superactive cation exchange activity class, an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with depth and base saturation low enough to meet the criteria for the Cumulic Ultic subgroup, redox features with chroma of 2 or less at depths of 30 to 40 inches, and has a xeric moisture regime.  The classification was revised 4/04 to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Ultic Haploxerolls and a new modal pedon described based on thorough investigation during a soil survey update.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for one pedon by Oregon State University reported in Soil Survey of Alsea Area, Oregon, October 1968.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
