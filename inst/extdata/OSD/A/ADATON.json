The calcium to magnesium ratio ranges from 1.0 to 5.0.\nThe Ap horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 to 6, and chroma 2 to 4.  Some pedons in uncultivated areas a thin A horizon less than 6 inches in thickness that has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, with value 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or less, or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 0.\nThe B horizon has hue 10YR, value 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or less, or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0, or it has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR with value 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow and brown range from few to many and are less than 40 percent of the mass.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the upper part and includes silty clay in the lower part.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt has from 20 to 35 percent clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amagon, Routon, and Tichnor series in the same family.  Soil series that are close competitors in similar families include the Calhoun, Clodine, Falkner, Forestdale, Fountain, Henry, Mayhew, Myatt, Sorter, Trebloc, Tuckerman, and Waller series.  Amagon soils have more than 15 percent sand, dominantly very fine, and have less clayey lower B horizons. Routon soils have lower B horizons that are medium acid to neutral and are less clayey.  Tichnor soils have A horizons with total thickness of 24 inches.  Calhoun, Fountain, and Waller soils have tongues of albic material in the argillic horizon.  Clodine soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class and siliceous mineralogy.  Tuckerman, and Waller soils have a fine-loamy particlar-size class; also, Waller soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Falkner soils are better drained and have a yellowish brown matrix color in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Forestdale soils have a fine particle-size class and montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Henry soils have a fragipan.  Mayhew soils have a fine particle-size class, a montmorillonitic mineralogy, and have high shrink-swell properties.  Myatt soils have less than 35 percent base saturation in the lower B horizon, a fine-loamy particle-size class, and siliceous mineralogy.  Sorter soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class and, and siliceous mineralogy.  Trebloc soils have siliceous mineralogy and less than 35 percent base saturation in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

These are nearly level soils that formed in silty materials.  The climate is warm and humid. The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches near the type location. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent."

Eutaw and Sessum soils are more clayey and have a high shrink-swell potential.  Wilcox soils have mottled red and gray colors and have more than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  The poorly drained Eutaw, Mayhew, Myatt, and Sessum soils are in similar positions in uplands as the Adaton soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Falkner and Wilcox soils are on more sloping parts of the terrain."
