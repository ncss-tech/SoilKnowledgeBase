    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 22 to 65 inches. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 22 to greater than 60 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizons, 0 to 20 percent in the Bs and E horizons, and 0 to 5 percent in the Bt and C horizon. Cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile.\nCultivated areas have an Ap horizon, up to 10 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 1 to 3. Some areas have an A horizon less than 4 inches thick with hues of 7.5YR, 5YR or neutral; values from 2 to 4 and chroma of 0 to 3. The A or Ap horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand. Reaction of the A or Ap horizon ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; and value and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are the same as for the Bs horizons. Reaction of the Bhs horizon ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs or Bs1 horizons have hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR; and value and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. It is loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. Reaction of the Bs1 horizon ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid. The Bs2 and Bs3 horizons have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. They have similar textures to the Bs or Bs1 horizon. Reaction of the Bs2 or Bs3 horizons ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have separate E'horizons that have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4. They are loamy sand, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or fine sandy loam.\nThere can be combinations of B/E, Bt or E/B horizons, but the B/E and/or Bt horizons are always present. The E part of the B/E or E/B horizons has colors and textures similar to those of the E' horizon. The B part of the B/E, E/B or Bt horizons has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Strata of silt loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, and sandy clay loam are in some pedons. Reaction of the B/E, E/B or Bt horizons ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E and Bt horizon. The lamellae are 2 to 6 inches thick, separated by E horizons 1/2 to 4 inches. In these pedons total accumulation of the Bt lamellae is greater than 6 inches. Some pedons have BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is stratified sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, and silt loam with thin layers of clay loam, sandy clay loam, and silty clay loam. It ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have free carbonates."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches, and mean annual air temperature range from 41 to 47 degrees F."

The moderately well drained Annalake, somewhat poorly drained Richter and poorly and very poorly drained Tonkey soils are in lower landscape positions and are in the same drainage sequence. Emmet and Leelanau soils are on adjacent morainic areas while stratified soils of both finer and coarser textured materials are associated with the Alcona soils in lake plain and outwash plain positions."
