  "OVERVIEW": "The Alcona series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified sandy and loamy glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, ground moraines, end moraines and stream terraces. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.",

Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizons, 0 to 20 percent in the Bs and E horizons, and 0 to 5 percent in the Bt and C horizon. Cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile.\nCultivated areas have an Ap horizon, up to 10 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 1 to 3. Some areas have an A horizon less than 4 inches thick with hues of 7.5YR, 5YR or neutral; values from 2 to 4 and chroma of 0 to 3. The A or Ap horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand. Reaction of the A or Ap horizon ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; and value and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are the same as for the Bs horizons. Reaction of the Bhs horizon ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs or Bs1 horizons have hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR; and value and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. It is loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.

Reaction of the Bs2 or Bs3 horizons ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have separate E'horizons that have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4. They are loamy sand, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or fine sandy loam.\nThere can be combinations of B/E, Bt or E/B horizons, but the B/E and/or Bt horizons are always present.
