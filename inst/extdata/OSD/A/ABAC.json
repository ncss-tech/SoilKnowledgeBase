    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F. and the average summer temperature at the paralithic contact is 55 to 58 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but they are dry in some part for 90 cumulative days or more.  The depth to shale or soft sandstone is 6 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments of shale, sandstone and occasionally limestone average 15 to 35 percent of the volume.  The soil has hue of 5YR or redder.  The soil material is usually loam or very fine sandy loam and less often silt loam.  The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 3.  The Bk and BCk horizons have a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It has very few to common threads and soft masses of segregated lime."

The soils formed in materials weathered from soft platy red siltstone shale and fine-grained sandstone of the Spokane Shale and the Chugwater member of the Permian and Triassic geologic systems.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 65 to 95 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 15 inches (Bw and Bk horizon).  The BCk is assumed to not meet cambic horizon criteria because it has more than 50 percent rock structure.\nParalithic contact - the zone beginning at 19 inches (Cr horizon).\nComments as of 5/1971: OSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 5/71.  The Abac soils were formerly classified as Lithosols.\nThe 2/2012 description reflects an update of horizonation and classification based on available documentation and manuscript taxonomic unit descriptions.  The OSD was originally classified as Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid, shallow Typic Ustortents and was originally horizonated with A1, C1, C2, C3, and C4.  Based on the Typical pedon for Big Horn County (which contains the majority of the extent) Abac was reclassified on 2/27/2012 to Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Haplustepts.  This series should be investigated further to determine which horizons truly have secondary carbonates and whether it typically has a cambic horizon thick enough to consistently meet criteria that would allow it to classify in the Inceptisols soil order. The following soil surveys currently use Abac series: Big Horn County, MT; Carbon County, MT; Johnson County, WY, Lewis and Clark NF, MT; Meagher County, MT; and Sheridan County, MT.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
