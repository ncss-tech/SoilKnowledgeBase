Amagon and Dundee soils have more than 15 percent sand that is dominantly very fine in the B horizon. Center and Fred soils have dominant chroma of more than 2 in the matrix of the B horizon and do not have dominant ped coatings with chroma 2 or less. Deerford soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the lower B horizon. Essen and Galvez soils do not have dark ped coats in the upper B horizon.  In addition, Galvez soils do not have calcium carbonate concretions. Fountain soils are dominantly 1 chroma in all subhorizons between the base of the Ap and 30 inches. Hebert soils have an argillic horizon that has redder hue. Jeanerette soils have a mollic epipedon. Kurk soils are more acid throughout and do not have calcium carbonate concretions. McGehee soils have a 2B horizon with redder hue. Patoutville soils have red iron accumulations and do not have subhorizons with calcium carbonate concretions. Routon soils lack subhorizons with carbonate concretions."
