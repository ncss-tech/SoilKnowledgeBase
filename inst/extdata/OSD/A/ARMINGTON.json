    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0582.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 11 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); cambic horizons from 11 to 33 inches (Bw2, Bw3 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons); few nonintersecting slickensides in Bw2 and Bw3 horizons.  Vertic Haploborolls feature a mollic epipedon and a cambic horizon.  They also have cracks that are 1/4 inch or more wide at a depth of 20 inches in most years, potential linear extensibility of 2 inches or more in the upper 40 inches, and more than 35 percent clay in horizons that are greater than 20 inches thick.  Armington soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
