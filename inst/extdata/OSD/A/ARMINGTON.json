Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nMineralogy is mixed with moderate amount of mica (illitic) type clays.\nIn most years this soil has cracks of 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches wide during late summer months that extend from the surface to a depth of 30 inches.\nA horizon - Hue:  10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma:  2 or 3\nTexture:  silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay\nClay content:  35 to 60 percent\nRock fragments:  0 to 10 percent pebbles\nReaction:  pH 7.4 to 7.8\nBw1 horizon - Hue:  10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma:  2 or 3\nTexture:  clay\nClay content:  60 to 75 percent\nRock fragments:  0 to 10 percent pebbles\nReaction:  pH 7.4 to 7.8\nBw2 horizon - Hue:  10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma:  4 or 6\nTexture:  clay\nClay content:  60 to 75 percent\nRock fragments:  0 to 10 percent pebbles\nReaction:  pH 7.4 to 7.8\nBw3 horizon - Hue:  10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma:  4 or 6\nTexture:  clay\nClay content:  60 to 75 percent\nRock fragments:  0 to 10 percent pebbles\nReaction:  pH 7.4 to 7.8\nNOTE:  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nBC horizon - Hue:  10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma:  4 or 6\nTexture:  clay\nClay content:  60 to 75 percent\nRock fragments:  0 to 10 percent pebbles\nReaction:  pH 7.4 to 7.8\nCOMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Armington soils are on fans and uplands.  Elevations are 3,600 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; very slow permeability.\nUSE AND VEGETATION:  Armington soils are used mainly as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Armington soils are of moderate extent in central and southern Montana.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana\nSERIES ESTABLISHED:  Big Horn County (Area), Montana, 1970.\nREMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0582.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 11 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); cambic horizons from 11 to 33 inches (Bw2, Bw3 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons); few nonintersecting slickensides in Bw2 and Bw3 horizons.  Vertic Haploborolls feature a mollic epipedon and a cambic horizon.  They also have cracks that are 1/4 inch or more wide at a depth of 20 inches in most years, potential linear extensibility of 2 inches or more in the upper 40 inches, and more than 35 percent clay in horizons that are greater than 20 inches thick.  Armington soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
