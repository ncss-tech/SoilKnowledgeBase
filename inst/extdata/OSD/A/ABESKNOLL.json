  "OVERVIEW": "The Abesknoll series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite, dacite, basalt and tuff.  Abesknoll soils are on mima mounds located on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
