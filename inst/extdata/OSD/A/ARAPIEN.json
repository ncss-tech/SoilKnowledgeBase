The soils are moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline. Salinity ranges from slight to strong. These soils are usually dry; they are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 70 to 85 days during the summer and are continually moist 60 to 75 days during the winter and early spring in 7 out of 10 years. Water table may occur at depths between 40 to 60 inches. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F. The particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay with less than 35 percent rock fragments and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bk and 2Ck horizons have a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures are loam, clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly clay loam. Some 2Ck horizons have very gravelly sandy loam textures."
