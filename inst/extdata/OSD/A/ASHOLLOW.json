  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands and sandhill drainageways.  They formed in loamy and sandy residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches).",
