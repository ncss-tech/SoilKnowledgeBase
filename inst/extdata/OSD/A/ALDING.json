  "OVERVIEW": "The Alding series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from metavolcanic rocks with an influence of ash in the surface.  Alding soils are on hills with slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Rock fragments in the solum average 20 to 35 percent and are mostly gravel.  The soil is dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and includes all or part of the 2Bt.  Base saturation is over 75 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 [SW1]moist and dry.  It is loam with 15 to 27 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent glass and aluminum plus half the iron is 0.20 to 0.40 percent (Vitrandic).  It has 0 to 3 percent cobbles and 20 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 15 to 25 percent gravel."

They formed in colluvium weathered from metavolcanic rocks with an influence of ash on the surface.  The climate can be characterized by cold wet winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation of 17 to 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F.; and mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F.
