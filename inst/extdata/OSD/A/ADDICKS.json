  "OVERVIEW": "The Addicks series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in thick loamy sediments. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on flats on coastal plains. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1169 mm (46 in). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",
