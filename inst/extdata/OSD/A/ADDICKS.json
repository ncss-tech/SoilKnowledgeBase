(Bt and Btk1 horizon)\nMollic epipedon -0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in). (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 28 to 203 cm (11 to 80 in). (Bt and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - 58 to 125 cm (23 to 49 in). (Btk horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Data on type - S72TX101-5 (72L273-72L276) and thin sections on file in the Soil Survey Laboratory support an argillic horizon.  Data from nearby similar landscape published in TAMU thesis: Distribution and Genesis of Calcic Horizons in some soils of the Texas Coast Prairies by Terrence M. Sobecki does not support an argillic horizon.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
