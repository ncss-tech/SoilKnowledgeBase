  "OVERVIEW": "The Akaska series consists of moderately deep to sand and gravel, well drained soils on terraces and outwash plains.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the underlying sand and gravel.  They formed in silty sediments over sand and gravel.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Most areas are cultivated.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to loose sand and gravel typically is about 37 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 28 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 18 inches in thickness and extends into the Bt horizon in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 through 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is silty clay loam, but in some pedons is silt loam averaging between 25 and 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand that is fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam but is gravelly loam or loam in some pedons.  Most pedons contain few to common, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a C horizon that has colors and textures of the Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon is multicolored, mainly in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y. Coatings of carbonate are on the underside of the pebbles in the upper part.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
