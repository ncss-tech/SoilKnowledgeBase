  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to 2B horizons range from 24 to 48 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments average 0 to 15 percent by volume of the solum, but individual horizons are allowed to have up to 35 percent.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Horizons with value of 3 are 1 to 4 inches thick.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  Textures are the same as those for the A horizon.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled without dominant matrix hue.  The Bt horizon dominantly is sandy clay loam or clay loam and ranges to sandy loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  The 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8, or it is mottled without dominant matrix color.  2Bt horizons are clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Gravelly layers are at or near the contact between the Bt and 2Bt horizons in some pedons.  Some pedons have multiple discontinuities.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with textures similar to those of the 2Bt horizons.  The 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8, or it is mottled without dominant matrix hue.\nThe 2C horizon is highly variable in color and commonly does not have a dominant matrix color.  It generally is loamy soil or saprolitic material."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Altavista, Bertie, Tetotum and Winton soils are members of the same family.  None of these soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the Bt horizons.\nThe Augusta, Johns, Starr, State, Wickham, and Whitwell series are similar soils in related families.  Augusta soils have Bt horizons with dominant moist chromas of 2 or less.  Starr soils do not have Bt horizons.  State and Wickham soils do not have low chroma mottles within the upper 24 inches of their Bt horizons.  Johns and Whitwell soils have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Abell soils are nearly level to gently sloping in upland depressions, footslopes and along intermittent drainageways in the Piedmont.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent. These soils formed in materials that have washed from associated soils on adjacent landscapes and in the underlying residuum.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

Appling, Cecil, Madison, and Mayodan soils are in a clayey family.  Colfax soils have a fragipan.  Durham and Granville soils do not have low chroma mottles in the upper 24 inches of their Bt horizons.  Louisburg soils do not have continuous Bt horizons and have coarser texture.  Worsham soils are poorly drained."
