  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Weathered sandstone occurs at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The ochric epipedon and depth to the layer of carbonate accumulation ranges from 4 to 13 inches.  Rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch depth are mostly gravel and range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F.  These soils are dry in all parts 50 to 55 percent of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Where mollic colors occur, they lack the thickness to qualify as mollisols.  It ranges from 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The Al horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline and moderately or strongly calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has dominant hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, but some are 2.5YR, value of 5 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry, 4 to 8 moist.  It is loam, silt loam or gravelly loam with gravel content of 0 to 20 percent.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline and strongly or very strongly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 8 dry, 7 or 8 moist.  It ranges from loam to very gravelly loam with gravel content of 0 to 40 percent.  The C horizon is strongly or very strongly calcareous."

Elevations range from 6,400 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F.  and the average annual precipitation is from 9 to 12 inches. Freeze-free period is 55 to 75 days."

Bocketon soils have a mollic epipedon.  Cutoff, Duckree, Slinger, and Solak soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in their control sections.  Lariat Pancheri soils have less than 18 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Ranruff soils have bedrock at depth of 10 to 20 inches. Saleratus soils do not have a calcic horizon."
