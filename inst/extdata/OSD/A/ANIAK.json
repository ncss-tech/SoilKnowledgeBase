  "OVERVIEW": "The Aniak series are flaggy or stony and have, in part of each pedon, black to dark brown fairly thick A horizons and dark grayish brown to olive C horizons over bedrock.  In 25 to 50 percent of each pedon, the soils are unvegetated and have no A horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil surface is hummocky, with many unvegetated \"frost scars\".  Thickness of the solum ranges from 4 to 8 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Stones and boulders are common on the surface.  The upper part of the A1 horizon may or may not be gravelly, and ranges in hue from 5YR to 10YR, with values and chromas ranging from 2/1 through 3/2.  The lower part is gravelly or flaggy, and ranges in hue from 7.5YR to 10YR, with values and chromas of 3/2 or 3/3.  In places a thin brown B horizon occurs, with colors of 10YR 3/4, 10YR 4/3, or 10YR 4/4.  The C horizon ranges in color from 10YR 4/2 through 5Y 4/3 or 5Y 5/3.  In some areas, pedons are bisequal.  MAST is less than 32 degrees F."

The climate is subarctic with long cold winters and short cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation is unknown, but probably ranges from low to moderate."
