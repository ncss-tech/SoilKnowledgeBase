  "OVERVIEW": "The Ardtoo series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, or schist, with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
