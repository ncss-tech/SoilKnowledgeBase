Analulu, Blinn Brevco, Daxty, Huntrock, Kamela, Lemoncreek, Redpeak, Santop and Thout soils are all moderately deep to a lithic contact. Blackprince soils are moderately deep to granite, gneiss or schist.   Ardenvoir soils have C horizons with loam, silt loam or sandy loam textures and have a paralithic contact to metasedimentary bedrock. Coxit, Jimbluff, Jumpe, Lekrem, Minaloosa, Ontrail, and Seeburg soils are very deep. Easte soils have an umbric epipedon and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Highhorn soils have 2Bwb horizons, have silty clay loam textures in the subsoil, and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Longort soils are moderately deep to densic material. Noil soils have 2 to 4 percent mica flakes throughout and have greater than 50 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ardtoo soils are on mountain side slopes at elevations of 2,000 to 5,000 feet. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. These soils occupy all aspects at lower elevations, but mainly southerly aspects at higher elevations. They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss or schist, with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 38 inches. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
