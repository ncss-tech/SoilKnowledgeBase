The average annual air temperature ranges from 74 to 78 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall ranges from 80 to 90 inches."

Consumo and Morado soils are moderately deep, have less clay in the control section, and have mixed mineralogy.  Daguey soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and are Oxisols.  Humatas soils have a thinner solum and parasesquic mineralogy."
