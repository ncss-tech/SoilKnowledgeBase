  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Alonso series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes of maturely dissected uplands.  They formed in fine-textured residuum that weathered from basic volcanic rock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 92 inches.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.",
