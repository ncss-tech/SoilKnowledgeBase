  "OVERVIEW": "The Aliceville series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits and shoulders, and side slopes on interfluves on  plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112). Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 880 mm (35 in.).  Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

The MLRA 112 boundary crosses the mesic thermic areas and for classification MLRA 112 soils are considered thermic.\nWAW 8/2009 Added to range in characteristics and updated competing series section.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNSSL Laboratory sample 08N0030 (pedon 07KS031105) is from the type location.  Other lab samples that support this series are: NSSL - 08N0024 (pedon S07OK147-110), 08N0031 (pedon S07KS207-106), 08N0032 (pedon S07KS037-107), 08N0033 (pedon S07KS099-108), 05N0815 (pedon S05KS-099-001), 07N0574 (07KS059101), and 07N0575 (pedon 07KS059104).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
