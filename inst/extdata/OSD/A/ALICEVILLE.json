    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aliceville soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits, shoulders, and side slopes on interfuves on the plains in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying material weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 880 mm to 1095 mm (35 to 43 in.) and is distributed throughout the year with May through July receiving the most precipitation usually during intense thunderstorms..  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 13 to 16 degrees C (55 to 62 degrees F)."

A layer of episaturation occurs intermittently during periods of high rainfall in most years at depths greater than 75 cm, duration is long enough to create redoximorphic concentrations but not of sufficient duration to create redoximorphic depletions."

    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Lula series in parts of Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma.\nDiagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon  0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in.)\nArgillic horizon  36 to 128 cm (14 to 50 in.)\nRedoximorphic concentrations  58 to 128 cm (23 to 50 in.)\nSlickensides  110 to 128 cm (43 to 50 in.)\nLinear extensibility greater than 6.0 cm within 100 cm.\nLithic contact  128 cm (50 in.)\nThe mean annual soil temperature at the type location and in the northern range of this series is slightly less than the 15 degree C break for thermic soils.  The MLRA 112 boundary crosses the mesic thermic areas and for classification MLRA 112 soils are considered thermic.\nWAW 8/2009 Added to range in characteristics and updated competing series section.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNSSL Laboratory sample 08N0030 (pedon 07KS031105) is from the type location.  Other lab samples that support this series are: NSSL - 08N0024 (pedon S07OK147-110), 08N0031 (pedon S07KS207-106), 08N0032 (pedon S07KS037-107), 08N0033 (pedon S07KS099-108), 05N0815 (pedon S05KS-099-001), 07N0574 (07KS059101), and 07N0575 (pedon 07KS059104).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
