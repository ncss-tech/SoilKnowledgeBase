  "OVERVIEW": "The Augustine series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuffs and lavas.  They are on bajadas and valley fill.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Arnor and Dermala soils have greater than 15 percent rock fragments. Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Gateson, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils receive most of the annual precipitation in the spring and fall and are in LRR-E or LRR-G. Bosonoak soils are calcareous to the surface. Carri, Celacy, Celavar, Elwop, Evpark, Gateson, Nyjack, and Ribera soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inch depths. Goesling soils have calcic horizons within 40 inches and would classify in a Calcidic subgroup.  Flugle and Orlie soils do not have a Btk horizon.  Iwela soils have a stony lithologic discontinuity. Lykorly soils have less than 35 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Navajita soils have moderate amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt plus sand fractions. Parkelei soils are continuously moist, in most years, in some part of the soil moisture control section November through April receiving more effective winter moisture. Pinitos soils are moist in all parts of the soil moisture control section 30 to 40 consecutive days during the 120 days following the winter solstice and are moist in all parts about 35 percent of the time that the soil temperature at 20 inch depths is above 41 degrees F."
