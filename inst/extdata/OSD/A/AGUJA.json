  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Aguja series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium from tuff.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain tops, flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 35 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
