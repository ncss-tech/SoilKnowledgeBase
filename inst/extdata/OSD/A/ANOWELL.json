  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Anowell series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, shale, chert and quartzite. The Anowell soils are on crests and side slopes of hills.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
