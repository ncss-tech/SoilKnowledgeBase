Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the A and E horizons, and 0 to 10 percent in the Bt horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in most pedons.  The Bt horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in most pedons.  Relic rock material with clay coatings are in many pedons.  The BC horizon is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam, with as much as 90 percent soft saprolite that crushes easily."
