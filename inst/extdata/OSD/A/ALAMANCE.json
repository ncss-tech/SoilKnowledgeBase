  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact is more than 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to neutral in the A and E horizons, very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Bt horizon, and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the C horizon.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the A and E horizons, and 0 to 10 percent in the Bt horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in most pedons.  The Bt horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in most pedons.  Relic rock material with clay coatings are in many pedons.  The BC horizon is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam, with as much as 90 percent soft saprolite that crushes easily."

Brandon, Choccolocco, Durham, Granville, Hartsells, Kirksey, Pickwick, and Silerton series are similar soils in other families.  Brandon, Choccolocco, Pickwick, and Silerton soils have mixed mineralogy.  Durham, Granville, and Hartsells soils have more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle-size control section.  Kirksey soils have wetness mottles of chroma 2 or less within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon."

The soil formed in residuum weathered from Carolina slate, argillite, sericite schist, or other fine-grained rock.  Average annual rainfall ranges from 37 to 60 inches, mean temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees Fahrenheit, and frost-free season ranges from 190 to 225 days."
