  "OVERVIEW": "The Agness series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist or phyllite rock types.  Agness soils occur in open grassland areas on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
