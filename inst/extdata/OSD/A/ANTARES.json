Dixaleta soils are dominated by channers and are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 cumulative days during July - September.  Lavabed soils are less than 20 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Seanna soils have more than 30 percent 2 to 5 millimeter gravel.  Shankba soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder, and are formed in silty parent material derived from sedimentary rock.  Xyzoic soils have hues of 2.5Y and more than 40 percent of the rock fragments consist of 2 to 5 millimeter gravel."
