  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 60 inches. Carbonates are within the soil, at depths ranging from 40 to 80 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. In the textural control section, average content of rock fragments, mainly pebbles but including cobblestones and stones, is greater than 35 percent. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 50 percent by volume in the A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon, and 35 to 60 percent in the lower part of the B and C horizons. Fine and coarser sand ranges from 50 to 70 percent of the fine earth in the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Some pedons have an A horizon with hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. It ranges from loamy sand to loam in the fine earth fraction. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have a thin BE with hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 5. Texture is sandy loam to loam in the fine earth fraction. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe B horizon ranges from l0YR through 2.5YR in hue, from 3 through 6 in value, and from 3 through 6 in chroma. The fine earth fraction of the B horizon above 20 inches ranges from sandy loam to loam; below 20 inches texture is coarser than loam. Coatings of clay, iron or organic matter are lacking or faint. The B horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Some pedons have a BC horizon up to 20 inches thick.\nThe C horizon ranges from 5YR through 2.5Y in hue, value is 4 or 5 and chroma ranges from 2 through 4. Value of 3 is allowed where lithochromic influence comes from local dark shale deposits. The C horizon is stratified gravel and sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam, predominantly from sandstone, but some is from limestone and locally small amounts are from shale. Water-sorted unconforming silts and clays, and sand lenses with little or no rock fragments are allowed below depths of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Cates and Pennichuck series are members of the same family. Cates and Pennnichuck soils have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.\nSimilar series in related families are the Chenango, Copake, Groton, Hoosic, and Tunkhannock series. Chenango, Hoosic and Tunkhannock soils lack carbonates within the soil. Copake soils have a contrasting particle-size control section. Groton soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Alton soils are on nearly level to very steep terraces, terrace faces, beach ridges, alluvial fans, and kames. They formed in glacial outwash and beach deposits dominated by acid, hard rock with material from limestone in the regolith below depths of 40 inches. In some places the substratum has silty lacustrine material below a depth of 40 inches. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 46 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days. The elevation ranges from 250 to 1000 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly and poorly drained Fredon soils and very poorly drained Halsey soils in adjacent low areas or depressions. Silty Unadilla and Williamson soils are on nearby stream terraces. Ontario, Stockbridge and Sodus formed in till and are associated on nearby uplands. The sandy Arkport and Colonie soils are on nearby remnant deltas."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained or somewhat excessively drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from very low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral soil is high above 40 inches, and is high to very high below a depth of 40 inches. In pedons that have a silty substratum, saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges to moderately low below 40 inches."
