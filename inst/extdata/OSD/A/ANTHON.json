  "OVERVIEW": "The Anthon series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess or silty alluvium and underlying stratified sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches).",
