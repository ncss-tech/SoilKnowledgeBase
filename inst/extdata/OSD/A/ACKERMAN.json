  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ackerman soils are on nearly level or depressional areas on outwash plains, till plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Ackerman soils formed in a thin layer of highly decomposed organic material, a thin layer of coprogenous material, and are underlain by fine sand. The adjacent soils are typically sandy. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 311 meters (580 feet to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adrian, Maumee, Moston, and Gilford soils and the competing Antung soils. The very poorly drained Adrian, Antung, and Moston soils are on similar landform positions as Ackerman soils. Adrian and Moston soils formed in more than 41 cm (16 inches) of herbaceous organic deposits. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Maumee soils are sandy or loamy throughout, and generally are at the margins of the depressions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the coprogenous material and very high in the underlying sandy material. Permeability is slow in the coprogenous material and rapid in the underlying sandy material."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Ackerman soils are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal row crops; mint and some vegetable truck crops are also grown. Native vegetation is water tolerant sedges, reeds, grasses, and shrubs."
