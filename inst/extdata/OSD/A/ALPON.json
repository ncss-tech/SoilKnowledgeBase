  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F.; and the mean summer soil temperature and where there is a very thin or no 0 horizon, ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist (udic moisture regime).  Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 36 to 50 inches.  The depth to sandstone or other bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The sola are 45 to 70 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 11 to 16 inches thick.  The A1 horizon has dry value of 4 to 5, moist value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  When mixed to 7 inches, it probably has a base saturation of 50 to 60 percent and 3 to 7 percent organic matter having a C:N ratio of 13.5 to 19.  This horizon is strongly or moderately acid.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam and is 25 to 40 inches thick.  This horizon is moderately acid to neutral and the argillic horizon is 12 to 24 inches thick.  The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand, and less than 15 percent rock fragments.  This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid to neutral.  It has continuous prominent to few faint clay films.  This horizon probably has between 60 and 75 percent base saturation.  It is 36 to 50 inches thick."

The soils formed in loess overlying residuum weathered from sandstone or colluvium from sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches, including 6 to 12 feet of snowfall.  Summer showers are common.  The frost-free period is 20 to 80 days."
