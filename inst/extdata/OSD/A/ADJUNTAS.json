  "REVDATE": "12/2003",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Adjuntas series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in clayey residuum that weathered from volcanic rock.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is about 76 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches.  Slopes range from 40 to 60 percent.",

(Colors are for moist soil.)\nAp--0 to 5 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay; moderate fine and medium granular structure; firm; slightly sticky, plastic; many fine roots; about 3 percent, by volume, volcanic fragments 0.25 to 1.0 inch in diameter; few fine quartz grains; many pores; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)\nBw1--5 to 10 inches; about 50 percent brown (7.5YR 4/4) and 50 percent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; slightly sticky, plastic; common fine roots; about 3 percent, by volume, volcanic fragments 0.25 to 1.0 inch in diameter; few fine quartz grains; many fine pores; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the Cr horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to R horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.  Content of pebbles range from 2 to 5 percent, by volume, throughout.  Quartz grains range from few to many throughout.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent in the cambic horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of yellow, white, brown, and red.  Relict features inherited form the underlying bedrock in shads of yellow, white, and brown, and red range from common to many.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of weathered saprolite.\nThe R horizon is composed of volcanic bedrock."
