  "OVERVIEW": "The Arrod series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in calcareous gravelly alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces and dissected alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. Elevation is 3,300 to 4,600 feet. Frost-free season is about 115 days.",
