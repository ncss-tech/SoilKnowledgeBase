    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft calcareous shale or sandstone ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Up to 5 percent soft lime masses are in the Bt horizon and calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F and is below 47 degrees F in parts of January and February.  It is not below 41 degrees F at any time.  The soil between depths of 6 and 18 inches is moist in all parts from January 1 to May 1 and dry in all parts from July 1 to October 31.  The particle-size control section commonly has 27 to 35 percent clay and has less than 1.2 times more clay than the A. horizon.  Twenty-five to 50 percent of the original surface was lost through erosion.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Organic matter content is 1 to 2 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent.\nThe BA horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/5, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/6 or 5/6.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have clay films.  Organic matter content is less than 1 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 5/6.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon is calcareous, strongly weathered, soft or very soft coarse-grained shale or fine grained sandstone."

Arburua, Kettleman, and Kilmer soils have ochric epipedons.  Fontana and Nacimiento soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Oneil soils are fine-silty. Sorrento and Woo soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with and mapped as the Kettleman series in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report.  These soils are being differentiated by characteristics that indicate more leaching and development (soft lime masses, mollic epipedon, cambic horizon and are deeper than 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Reaction is determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture is determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HC1.  Calcium carbonate equivalent determined by HC1 and syringe field method. Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Pedon S87CA-047-001 (Range in characteristics)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
