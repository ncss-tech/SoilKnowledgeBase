  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Aspocket series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Aspocket soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 500 to 1,150 mm, mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
