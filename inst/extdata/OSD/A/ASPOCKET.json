They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.   Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,130 to 3,050 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 500 to 1,150 mm, mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
