    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 67 degrees F.  The soils are moist in all parts of the moisture control section for 50 to 60 percent of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches.  They are dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 4-month period following the summer solstice, and are moist in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 4-month period following the winter solstice in more than 6 out of 10 years.  The moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 3 to 13 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates range from 14 to 36 inches.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Rock fragments are typically cobbles with the range including gravel and stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Clay films range from thin to moderately thick. Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam and rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam and rock fragment content ranges from 25 to 60 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline and moderately calcareous to very strongly calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 to 6.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline and strongly calcareous to very strongly calcareous. Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay loam, loam, coarse sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or silt loam and the rock fragment content ranges from 25 to 70 percent.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 40 percent."
