Goldrun soils are sandy throughout and are on sand dunes.  Boravall soils are poorly drained and have an aquic moisture regime.  Catlow soils are loamy-skeletal and are on old beach terraces.  Davey soils have sandy particle-size control section.  Defenbaugh soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Enko soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section."
