  "OVERVIEW": "The Alvodest series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly to moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  Alvodest soils are on basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
