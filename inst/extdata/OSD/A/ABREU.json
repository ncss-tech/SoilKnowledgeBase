  "REVDATE": "02/2018",
  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Abreu series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from acid igneous and metamorphic rock on mountain footslopes and sideslopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 C.",
