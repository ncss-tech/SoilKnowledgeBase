  "OVERVIEW": "The Anan series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in sand and gravel alluvium.  Anan soils are in floodplains and on depressional areas on alluvial terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from sea level to 300 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The weighted average particle size in the 10 to 40 inches control section is loamy fine sand or coarser.  Gravel content ranges from 35 to 60 percent in the control section.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the organic mat, and from moderately acid to slightly acid in the mineral horizons..\nThe combined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 1 to 7 inches.\nThe C horizon has hues from 10YR to 5Y, values from 4 to 7, and chromas from 0 to 2.  Textures is typically sand stratified with fine sand, very fine sand, coarse sand and gravel and, occasionally, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam."
