The weighted average particle size in the 10 to 40 inches control section is loamy fine sand or coarser.  Gravel content ranges from 35 to 60 percent in the control section.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the organic mat, and from moderately acid to slightly acid in the mineral horizons..\nThe combined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 1 to 7 inches.\nThe C horizon has hues from 10YR to 5Y, values from 4 to 7, and chromas from 0 to 2.  Textures is typically sand stratified with fine sand, very fine sand, coarse sand and gravel and, occasionally, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam."
