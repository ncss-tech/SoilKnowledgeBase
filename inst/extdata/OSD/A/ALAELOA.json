Particle size family classification changed from fine to very-fine. Competing series updated and other minor edits. 3/17 MRK. Minor edits to Geographic Setting and format. 12/03 SN. Changed horizon pH using lab data; added pan evaporation data; updated Competing Series. 9/01 SN. Classification changed from Fine kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Ustic Palehumults.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Alaeloa NSSL sample S89HI-003-007 (formerly S89HI-007-007). Data for pedon S89HI-003-007 suggests particle size control section has greater than 60 percent clay. <50% kaolinite plus mica (46% est.) Needmore mineralogy (DTA) data. Bulk density data needed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
