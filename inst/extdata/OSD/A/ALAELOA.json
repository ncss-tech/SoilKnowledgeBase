  "OVERVIEW": "The Alaeloa series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rock. Alaeloa soils are on low mountain slopes and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 1219 millimeters (48 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C. (72 degrees F.)",
