  "STATES": "AZ,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arada series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy aeolian material over mixed alluvium.  The Arada soils are on fan piedmonts, sand sheets, terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
