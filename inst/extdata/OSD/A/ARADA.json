Knobhill soils have greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the control section and have  a depth to the calcic horizon of 16 to 24 inches.  Lovelace soils have a depth to the calcic horizon of 16 to 24 inches and lack appreciable summer precipitation.  Rilloso soils have a calcic horizon shallower than 16 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arada soils are on fan piedmonts, sand sheets, terraces and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in sandy eolian material over alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The elevations are 1400 to 3000 feet.  The climate semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; the mean annual temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F., and the frost free season is about 180 to 270 days."
