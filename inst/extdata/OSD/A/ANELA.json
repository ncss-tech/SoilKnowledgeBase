  "OVERVIEW": "The Anela series consists of deep, well drained soils on flood plains and stream terraces. These soils formed in mixed gravelly alluvium dominantly from sedimentary rock. Slope is 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were mapped as Sorrento loam and Sorrento gravelly loam in the Los Banos Area, Series 1939 report. They are being differentiated by being skeletal and lacking carbonates. The pH is determined by colormetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators. Texture is determined by hydrometer method. Organic matter estimated from adjacent soils where Walkley-Black digestion method was used. Presence of carbonates determined by 10 percent HCl."
