  "OVERVIEW": "The Alvor series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from shale, sandstone, and basic igneous rocks. Alvor soils are on low terraces adjacent to perennial streams and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
