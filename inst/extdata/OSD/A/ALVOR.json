The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. The control section is silty clay or clay and has 40 to 55 percent clay. Rock fragments in the solum range from 0 to 10 percent. The mollic epipedon is 24 to more than 30 inches thick. Soil reaction is medium to slightly acid and hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of neutral through 3 dry. It is silty clay or clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alvor soils are on low terraces adjacent to perennial streams at elevations of 100 to 350 feet. These soils formed in alluvium weathered from shale, sandstone and basic igneous rocks.  They are in a marine climate with 40 to 60 inches annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain in the winter. Mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., mean July temperature is 65 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
