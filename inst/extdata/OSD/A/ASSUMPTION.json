  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Assumption soils are on head slopes, side slopes and interfluves on nearly level to moderately steep ground moraines on till plains of Illinois age. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. These soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Some pedons contain a layer of silty or loamy mixed loess and drift material of variable thickness between the loess and the underlying till. The mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), and frost free period is 150 to 185 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atlas, Coatsburg, Keller, Osco, and Velma soils. The somewhat poorly drained Atlas soils and poorly drained Coatsburg soils are on similar landform positions as Assumption soils or are down slope. Atlas and Coatsburg soils have a thinner surface mantle of loess or other silty material. In addition, Atlas soils do not have a mollic epipedon. The somewhat poorly drained Keller soils are on similar parts of the landform nearby and have redox depletions or 2 chroma matrix colors immediately below the mollic epipedon. The well drained Osco soils are on nearby interfluves and slopes above Assumption soils and formed in loess. The well drained Velma soils formed in Illinois till and are down slope from Assumption soils that have a paleosol."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess, moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the silty or loamy mixed loess and drift, and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Permeability is moderate in the loess, moderately slow in the mixed loess and drift, and slow or very slow in the till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. The perched seasonal high water table is 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) below the surface from February to April.  Seep spots on side slopes are common as the result of perched water above the paleosol."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 2Btg or 2Bt horizon of Assumption soils is the lower part of the solum superimposed upon a Sangamon paleosol in the Illinoisan till. Many of the properties of those horizons are believed to have been inherited from the paleosol. It is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the modern solum from those of the paleosol in many pedons. The variability of the properties is related to the degree of geologic truncation of the paleosol before it was buried by loess, and to the extent of modern soil development into the old materials. Some pedons have a dark colored layer at the top of the paleosol that was the surface layer of the paleosol, and is now part of the 2Bt or 3Bt horizon of the modern soil. In pedons that do not have the mixed loess and drift layer, the Peoria loess lies directly on the paleosol. The paleosolic Bt horizon typically is gray, but ranges to brown in some pedons. Calcium and other bases have been replenished in the paleosol in some pedons after burial by loess by seepage from the mantling material up slope.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon -- from a depth of 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 inches) [Ap, A, and AB horizons]\nargillic horizon -- from a depth of 41 to 152 cm (16 to 60 inches) [Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons]\nlithologic discontinuity at 89 cm (35 inches)\nThe slope range was expanded to include Assumption on A slopes.  The A slope units were correlated as part of an MLRA project in Ogle County, Illinois.\nThe taxonomic classification was changed from fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls to fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Argiudolls. The change was based on data review and field investigations as part of an MLRA project.\nTaxonomy version -- Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon is 1997IL073900.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
