  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arson series consists of deep, well drained soils on side slopes, shoulders and ridge summits of foothills and low mountains. They formed in material from fine grained quartzites and siltite of the Libby, Striped Peak and Prichard formations of the Belt supergroup that is blanketed by a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash and loess. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 60 percent. The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 31 inches.",
