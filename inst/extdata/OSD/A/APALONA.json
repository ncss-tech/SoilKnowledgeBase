Solsberry soils have rock fragments in the 2Btx horizon that are dominantly of igneous lithology. Zanesville soils average less than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section and have a lithic contact."

They formed in 76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 inches) of silty loess and the underlying clayey and loamy residuum. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 119 cm (40 to 46 47 inches).

The deep or very deep Ebal, very deep Deuchars, and moderately deep Kitterman soils are on shoulders and backslopes. The deep, less clayey Wellston soils are on shoulders and backslopes. The deep or very deep, less clayey Zanesville soils are on summits, shoulders and the upper part of backslopes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) above the fragipan and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the fragipan and below. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan and below. The potential for surface water runoff is medium to very high. For non-eroded soils, depth to an intermittent, perched high water table is at a depth of 61 to 91 centimeters (2.0 to 3.0 feet) from December to April in most years. For severely eroded soils, depth to an intermittent, perched high water table is at a depth of 46 to 61 centimeters (1.5 to 2.0 feet) from December to April in most years."
