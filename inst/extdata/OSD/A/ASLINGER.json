  "OVERVIEW": "The Aslinger series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils on high terraces, strath terraces, valley footslopes, and in heads of drainageways.  These soils formed in loamy colluvium and loamy or clayey alluvium.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

Cornwall soils are fine-silty and are on similar landscape positions.  Freeburg soils are somewhat poorly drained, are fine-silty, and are on similar landscape positions.  Relfe and Tilk soils are better drained, have more rock fragments in the upper part of the profile, and are on lower terraces and flood plains.
