    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aslinger soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping high terraces, strath terraces, valley footslopes, and in heads of drainageways.  These soils formed in loamy colluvium and loamy or clayey alluvium.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 38 to 45 inches."

Alred and Clarksville soils are skeletal and are on adjacent uplands.  Captina and Viraton soils have fragipans and are on uplands.  Cornwall soils are fine-silty and are on similar landscape positions.  Freeburg soils are somewhat poorly drained, are fine-silty, and are on similar landscape positions.  Relfe and Tilk soils are better drained, have more rock fragments in the upper part of the profile, and are on lower terraces and flood plains. Secesh soils are well drained and are on lower terraces and floodplains."
