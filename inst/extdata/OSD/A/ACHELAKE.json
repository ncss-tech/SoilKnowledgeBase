These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 15 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 15 to 30 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid- oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 15 to 25 percent fine sand or coarser, 0 to 5 percent pebbles, and an apparent field estimated 4 to 12 percent clay content in the control section. One or more subhorizons in the top 30 inches of the profile, including the surface horizon in all cases, has less than 75 percent base saturation by sum of cations.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe BA horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Chroma is 2 or 3 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is slightly to moderately alkaline. Textures are ashy loam, ashy fine sandy loam or ashy silt loam."

The Mansonia series has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.55 to 0.85 g/cc and 5 to 35 percent pumice, 2.0 to 5.0 mm. in diameter in the particle-size control section. The Watco series are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days. Dinkels soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock. Zark soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Shiva soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 52 degrees F. Nemire soils have a mollic epipedon over 20 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Achelake soils are in draws and drainageways on plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash, and pumice. Elevations are 2,000 to 2,500 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches. Average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 180 days."
