  "OVERVIEW": "The Achelake series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash. They are in draws and drainageways on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 15 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 15 to 30 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid- oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 15 to 25 percent fine sand or coarser, 0 to 5 percent pebbles, and an apparent field estimated 4 to 12 percent clay content in the control section. One or more subhorizons in the top 30 inches of the profile, including the surface horizon in all cases, has less than 75 percent base saturation by sum of cations.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe BA horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Chroma is 2 or 3 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is slightly to moderately alkaline. Textures are ashy loam, ashy fine sandy loam or ashy silt loam."
