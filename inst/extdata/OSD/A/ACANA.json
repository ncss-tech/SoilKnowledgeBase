These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits. Elevations range from 1,500 to 1,800 meters. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The climate is cool, semiarid, with a mean annual precipitation of 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the mean annual soil temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C. The frost free period is 100 to 130 days."
