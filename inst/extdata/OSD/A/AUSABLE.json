  "OVERVIEW": "The Ausable series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in sandy alluvium containing thin bands of organic material on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C (43 degrees F).",

The depth to the top of a seasonal high water tables ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface at some time in normal years. It is commonly flooded from brief to long periods of time during the months of November to May. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate or high in the organic part and high in the mineral part."

Ground cover includes meadowsweet, sedges, grasses, rushes, ferns, and horsetails."
