  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 860 mm (28 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and the moderately well drained Croswell soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Bowstring, Tawas, and Lupton soils are in deeper depressions. The very poorly drained Leafriver soils are adjacent to the Ausable soils."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water tables ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface at some time in normal years. It is commonly flooded from brief to long periods of time during the months of November to May. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate or high in the organic part and high in the mineral part."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are in a natural condition of tag alder, willow, sedges, and grasses. A small percentage has been cleared and developed for use as recreational land with excavated ponds. Common tree species include northern white-cedar, balsam poplar, paper birch, and black ash. Ground cover includes meadowsweet, sedges, grasses, rushes, ferns, and horsetails."
