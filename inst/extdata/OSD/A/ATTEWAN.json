  "OVERVIEW": "The Attewan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and glacial outwash that is 20 to 40 inches deep over very gravelly loamy sand or sand.  These soils are on outwash terraces, stream terraces, eskers, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
