The average annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 65 inches (686 to 1650 mm) and the frost-free season is 50 to 100 days."

Kauder soils are on hills, have a volcanic ash mantle and have a fragipan.  Texascreek soils are on south and west-facing convex slopes and have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Uvi soils are on similar landscapes and are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section."
