  "OVERVIEW": "The Aldermand series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that\nformed in mixed volcanic ash and material from granitic or metamorphic rock.  Aldermand soils are on mountains and canyons and have slopes of 35 to 85 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
