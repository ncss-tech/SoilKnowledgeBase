  "OVERVIEW": "The Agon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils over a thin duripan underlain by bedrock,  Agon soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Agon soils are on rock pediment and remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
