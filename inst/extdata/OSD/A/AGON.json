Elevations are 3,500 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is hot, arid with relatively even distribution of precipitation with slight peaks in January and August.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 8 inches; mean annual temperature is about 59 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 190 to 210 days."
