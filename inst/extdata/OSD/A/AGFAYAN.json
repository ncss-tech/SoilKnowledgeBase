  "STATES": "PB",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Agfayan series consists of well drained soils of moderately slow permeability that are very shallow to strongly weathered tuff. They are on volcanic uplands, and formed in residuum from marine-deposited tuff, tuff breccia, and tuffaceous sandstones. Slopes range from 7 to 99 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",
