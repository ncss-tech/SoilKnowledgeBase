  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry between 1/2 and 3/4 of the time when the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F. These soils are moist during the late fall, winter and spring.  The particle-size control section is sandy throughout and averages 35 to 85 percent coarse fragments, mostly basalt.  Depth, to a lithic contact with basalt is 20 to 40 inches.  The organic matter content is assumed to be less than 1 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  Texture is fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sand, or sand and is 45 to 90 percent coarse fragments mostly basalt.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have surface horizons with less than 35 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alderdale soils are on benches, terraces and escarpments at elevations of 300 to 950 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in glacial outwash, and basaltic colluvium and a thin mantle of eolian sand over basalt.  The climate is arid, summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The average January temperature is about 33 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 76 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 3 inches, a particle-size control section from 10 to 35 inches that is sandy throughout and averages 85 percent rock fragments and a lithic contact at 35 inches.  These soils are correlated as Burbank series basalt substratum in the 1971 soil survey of Benton County, Washington.  The classification was changed from sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Torriorthents to sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Xeric Torriorthents in 1993.  The original type location has been inundated by a reservoir of the Columbia River.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
