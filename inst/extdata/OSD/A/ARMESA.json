  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Armesa soils are on pediment foot and toeslopes and inset fans on fan piedmonts at the southern end of the Sacramento mountains on the Otero Mesa.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent but are primarily 1 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 3,800 to 6,500 feet.  The soils formed in moderately fine textured alluvium weathered from limestone, sandstone, or shale.  An eolian mantle of very fine sandy loam covers the entire Otero Mesa.  The area has a warm, semiarid continental climate with an annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
