  "OVERVIEW": "The Arosa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks on alluvial fans and valley floors. Slopes are 1 to 12 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 18 to 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
