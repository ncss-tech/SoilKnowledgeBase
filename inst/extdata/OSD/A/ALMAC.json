    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Almac soils are on mountain ridgetops and back slopes.  They formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from schist, phyllite, and gneiss.  Elevations are 3,200 to 6,000 feet.  The soil is in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 19 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F., and the mean annual air temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F. is about 100 to 140 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in type location and classification from medial over loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthods to Ashy over loamy, mixed Xeric Vitricryands.  Laboratory data available for this soil are S79WA-007002 and Pedon Number 87P754.  Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 1 inch (possible Mt. St. Helens `W' ash), a cambic horizon from 1 to 23 inches, and an argillic horizon from 23 to 50 inches.  The particle-size control section is the zone from the mineral surface to 40 inches (E, Bs1, Bs2, Bs3, 2Bt1, 2Bt2 and part of 2Bt3 horizon)\nThis pedon requires additional investigation as to a udic soil moisture regime based on the presence of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
