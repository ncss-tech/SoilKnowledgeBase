Laboratory data available for this soil are S79WA-007002 and Pedon Number 87P754.  Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 1 inch (possible Mt. St. Helens `W' ash), a cambic horizon from 1 to 23 inches, and an argillic horizon from 23 to 50 inches.  The particle-size control section is the zone from the mineral surface to 40 inches (E, Bs1, Bs2, Bs3, 2Bt1, 2Bt2 and part of 2Bt3 horizon)\nThis pedon requires additional investigation as to a udic soil moisture regime based on the presence of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
