  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Jenny, Lassen, Montague, and Pit series.  Jenny and Pit soils lack a lithic contact above depth of 40 inches.  Lassen soils have hue yellower than 5YR.  Montague soils have dark gray (dry) A horizons, dark grayish brown C horizons, and a thin indurated hardpan over a petrocalcic horizon (massive tuff) at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Pit soils are somewhat poorly or poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aikman soils are nearly level to moderately steep on summits, shoulders and backslopes of structural benches and foothills at elevations of 3,000 to 3,700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from rhyolite or rhyolitic tuff mixed with alluvium from lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from granite.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
