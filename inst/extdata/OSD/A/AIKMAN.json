  "OVERVIEW": "The Aikman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in residuum from rhyolite or rhyolitic tuff mixed with alluvium from lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from granite.  Aikman soils are on structural benches and foothills.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from rhyolite or rhyolitic tuff mixed with alluvium from lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from granite.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
