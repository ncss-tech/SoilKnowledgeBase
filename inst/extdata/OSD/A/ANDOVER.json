  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan is 16 to 28 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 6 to 50 feet. Subrounded to angular rock fragments, 1 to 20 inches across, are well distributed in the profile. They range from 0 to 40 percent by volume in individual layers of the B horizon and 10 to 50 percent in the C horizon. Weighted average rock fragment content is more than 20 percent and less than 35 percent in the control section. Cobbly, very cobbly, stony and very stony phases are common. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, when unlimed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 1 or 2, and it is mottled. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is moderate medium prismatic or weak or moderate medium subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 8, and it is mottled. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate very coarse prismatic parting to weak or medium thick platy or moderate medium subangular blocky. Consistence is firm, very firm, or brittle.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive or has weak very coarse or coarse prismatic structure parting to weak thick platy."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Cokesbury, Lamington, Nolo, and Shalmadine series are potentially in the same family.  Cokesbury soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and formed in glacial till. Lamington soils have matrix colors of 7.5YR or redder. Nolo soils have fewer rock fragments in the control section. Shelmadine soils have 45 to 65 percent silt in the particle-size control section.\nBrinkerton, Frenchtown, and Thorndale series are in related families. Brinkerton soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the textural control section. Frenchtown and Thorndale soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent base."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Andover soils are on nearly level to sloping benches, concave toeslopes and footslopes, and swales usually along the base of prominent ridges. Slope gradients are commonly 2 to 8 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils developed in loamy colluvium derived from acid, gray and red sandstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

Berks, Dekalb, Gilpin, Hazleton, Klinesville, Lehew, and Weikert soils are on adjacent residual uplands and are well drained, have thinner sola, and do not have fragipans."
