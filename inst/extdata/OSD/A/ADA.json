  "OVERVIEW": "The Ada series consists of very deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum from mixed sediments. They are on foothills and have slopes of 4 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Current Spring soils cannot be adequately separated although are formed in alluvium from quartzite, conglomerate and limestone, and in addition, have vegetative indicators (needleandthread) which reflect a drier soil moisture regime.  Fiddler soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Hiibner soils are slightly calcareous below 45 inches, have moderate to strong prismatic structure in the Bt horizon, and have angular quartzite and sandstone rock fragments dominating the particle-size control section. Immig soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Provig soils have sola less than 20 inches thick and have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F."

Day soils are on terraces and are very fine-textured. Adelmann and Shawmount soils have an aridic soil moisture regime. Ladd soils are on mountain slopes and are fine-loamy. Adelmann, Cranegulch and Shawmount soils occur on the same landform as the Ada soils."
