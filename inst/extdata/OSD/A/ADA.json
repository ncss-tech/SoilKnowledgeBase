    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Current Spring, Fiddler, Hiibner, Immig and Provig series. Current Spring soils cannot be adequately separated although are formed in alluvium from quartzite, conglomerate and limestone, and in addition, have vegetative indicators (needleandthread) which reflect a drier soil moisture regime.  Fiddler soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Hiibner soils are slightly calcareous below 45 inches, have moderate to strong prismatic structure in the Bt horizon, and have angular quartzite and sandstone rock fragments dominating the particle-size control section. Immig soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Provig soils have sola less than 20 inches thick and have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F."

Slopes are 4 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 2,700 to 4,500 feet. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches and the average annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

Brent soils are on terraces in foothills and mountains and are fine-textured. Cranegulch contain less than 35 percent rock in the particle-size control section. Day soils are on terraces and are very fine-textured. Adelmann and Shawmount soils have an aridic soil moisture regime. Ladd soils are on mountain slopes and are fine-loamy. Adelmann, Cranegulch and Shawmount soils occur on the same landform as the Ada soils."
