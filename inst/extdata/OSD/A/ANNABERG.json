(Colors for moist conditions unless otherwise noted.)\nA1--0 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots, few coarse roots; about 35 percent, by volume, pebbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

(3 to 8 inches thick)\nR--10 to 60 inches; 50 percent reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) and 50 percent yellow (10YR 7/8) unweathered, fine-grained, volcanic bedrock.  The rock is weathered and has a few fine roots in the upper 4 to 8 inches."

    "section": "TYPE LOCATION",
    "content": "TYPE LOCATION:  Representative profile of Annaberg gravelly loam, in an area of Annaberg-Maho Bay Complex, 40 to 60 percent slopes, extremely stony; St. John Island, Leinster Bay, 0.1 mile southwest of the hill top ruins (about 0.2 mile from Leinster Point), or 0.1 mile northwest of the Leinster Bay Cemetery, 75 feet north of the Johnny Horn Trail, on a steep southwestern aspect."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 6 to 15 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 6 to 16 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, and from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the Bw and Cr horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 10 to more than 60 percent, by volume.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or their gravelly to extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe R horizon is unweathered very strongly cemented to indurated igneous bedrock.  The rock is weathered and fractured in the upper 0 to 8 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils in related families include the Caguabo, Cramer, Descalabrado, Fredriksdal and Southgate series.  The Cramer, Descalabrado, and Fredriksdal soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Fredriksdal soils have vermiculitic mineralogy.  The Caguabo and Southgate soils do not have a dark surface horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 12 to 90 percent.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 76 to 82 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches"

Jealousy soils have clayey, smectitic particle-size control sections and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Maho Bay soils have loamy horizons and are shallow to bedrock.  Parasol soils are very deep to intrusive bedrock.  Victory soils are moderately deep to bedrock and do not have the dark surface horizon."
