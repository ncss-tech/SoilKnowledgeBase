  "OVERVIEW": "The Alvarado series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in outwash and alluvium.  Alvarado soils are on fans and stream terraces and have slopes of 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F; the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F.  In most years a temporary water table in undrained soils is at a depth of two to four feet between March 1 and June 30, and is below four feet or absent the remainder of the year.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 35 to 75 percent.  Rock fragments are rounded and dominantly less than 6 inches in diameter.  Hue ranges from 5YR to 10YR in all horizons.  Depth to any calcareous material is 30 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Mottles range from common to many and from distinct to prominent and chroma of mottles ranges from 0 through 8.  These horizons are 20 to 35 percent clay.  They are slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 and is mottled.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline."
