  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to sandstone or shale bedrock is 40 to 72 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the solum, 5 to 15 percent in the lower part of the solum, and 10 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid throughout unless limed.  Kaolinite and illite are the dominant clay minerals with detectable amounts of chlorite and vermiculite.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Undisturbed A horizons are neutral or have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It ranges from loam to silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1.\nThe Btg horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It has distinct or prominent mottles.  It ranges from silty clay loam to clay with channery analogues in the lower part.  Clay content in some subhorizons is as high as 55 percent, but the weighted average is slightly above 35 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 8, and is mottled.  It ranges from loam to silty clay in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Elkton, Kinkora, and Purdy series are in the same family.  Elkton soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Purdy soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Kinkora soils are micaceous.\nBaile, Brinkerton, Canadice, Cavode, Library, Prout, Shrewsbury, and Trumbull series are in related families.  Baile, Brinkerton, and Shrewsbury soils have control sections with weighted average clay content of less than 35 percent.  Cavode and Prout soils have a subhorizon between the A horizon and 30 inches which has more than 40 percent of the soil matrix with chroma of 3 or more.  Canadice, Library, and Trumbull soils have base saturations higher than 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Armagh soils are on broad ridgetops and benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils developed in materials weathered from acid gray shale, with some interbedded siltstone and sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 48 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 57 degrees F."

Other associated soils include the Brinkerton, a competing series, the Gilpin soils which are well drained, and the Ernest soils which are moderately well drained, less clayey and have a fragipan."
