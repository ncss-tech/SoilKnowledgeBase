  "OVERVIEW": "The Armagh series consists of deep and very deep, poorly drained soils formed in residuum from acid shale interbedded with siltstone and sandstone.  They are on broad ridgetops and benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Mean annual precipitation is 1066 millimeters (42 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 10.5 degrees C (51 F).",

It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btg horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  It ranges from silty clay loam to clay with channery analogues in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with colors and textures similar to the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 8, and is mottled.

Lenni soils formed in clayey eolian deposits underlain by sandy fluviomarine deposits on broad interstream divides, and in shallow depressions primarily in the northern Coastal Plain. Purdy soils formed in slackwater deposits on terraces and have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section."

Brinkerton and Ernest formed in colluvium and have a fragipan.  Gilpin and Rayne soils are well drained and lack redoximorphic features."
