  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Altazano soils are on small inset fans of erosional fan remnants and narrow flood plains of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; and from Tertiary granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buckhorse, Levante, and Dondiego soils. Buckhorse soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent toeslopes.  Levante soils are sandy, do not have buried soils within 40 inches, and occur on adjacent narrowflood plains of arroyos.  Dondiego soils are fine-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent low stream terraces."

These soils are subject to occasional or frequent, extremely brief periods of flooding between July and September. Floodwaters may have high velocity but are generally less than 2 feet deep."
