  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Altazano series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist, and from granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone. Altazano soils are on inset fans of eroded fan remnants and narrow flood plains of valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
