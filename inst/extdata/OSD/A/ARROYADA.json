  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 60 to more than 80 inches.  Intersecting slickensides begin at depths ranging from 12 to 30 inches.\nExchangeable sodium percentage is 15 or more at depths of 15 to 30 inches and increases with depth.  Electrical conductivity is 0 to 4 mmhos per cm in the upper 10 inches and increases with depth.  It is 4 to 20 mmhos per cm below a depth of 20 inches.  The soil is a clay or silty clay with the clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control section ranging from 45 to 60 percent.  The amplitude of waviness in the boundary between the A and B/A horizons is about 5 to 17 inches.  Horizontal variations between microknolls and microhighs is 6 to 12 inches. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Streaks of A material comprise 1 to about 10 percent by volume to depths of 80 inches. The soil cracks 0.4 inch to 3 inches wide at the surface when dry, and the cracks extend to a depth of more than 20 inches.\nThe A horizon is gray (10YR 5/1; N 5/0) or dark gray (10YR 4/1). Moist values are 3.5 to about 5.\nThe B/A horizon is gray (10YR 6/1, 5/1, 6/1; N 6/0, 5/0), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), very pale brown (10YR 7/3), light gray (10YR 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2; 5Y 6/1),grayish brown (10YR 6/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light olive gray (5Y 6/2), or brown (10YR 5/3).  Mottles are fine to coarse, faint or distinct and are brownish to grayish. Common to many streaks have colors of the A horizon.\nThe C horizon is the same color or slightly lighter in color than the B horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Mercedes series is the only series in the same family.  Other competitors are Benito, Coquat Lomalta, Montell, Monteola, Tiocano, and Victoria series.  Montell, Monteola, and Victoria soils have cracks that remain open more than 150 days in most years.  Benito and Lomalta soils have more than 60 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Mercedes soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods, have a different native plant community, and lack mottles in the A and B horizons. Coquat soils have chroma of 2 or more in the upper 12 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in calcareous clayey alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F.,  Frost free days range from 280 to 325 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 550 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 25 to 34."

In addition, Maverick and Viboras soils lack intersecting slickensides."
