Rock fragments include pebbles and cobbles composed of limestone.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 60 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Nodules and soft masses of calcium carbonate concretions and other features such as filaments and threads of calcium carbonate range from common to many.  Content of rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BCk horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Nodules and soft masses of calcium carbonate concretions and other features such as filaments and threads of calcium carbonate range from common to many.  Content of rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent, by volume.  Textures are similar to the Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Content of rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, silt loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of soft limestone bedrock.

Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  They formed in material weathered from soft limestone bedrock.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 78 to 82 degrees F."
