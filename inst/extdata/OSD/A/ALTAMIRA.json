  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Altamira series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on ridge tops, summits, and side slopes of uplands in the limestone hills of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in residuum that weathered from soft limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.",
