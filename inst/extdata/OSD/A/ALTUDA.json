  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Rock outcrops are common on slopes of 20 percent or greater.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 140 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,940 feet. Thornthwaite PE indices are less than 24."

Brewster soils are noncalcareous and formed over igneous bedrock in similar positions.  Catto soils do not have calcic horizons and are over chert bedrock in similar positions.  Stovall soils have sola deeper than 60 inches and have less than 5 percent coarse fragments.  They are on broad alluvial flats in lower positions."

Classification was changed from mixed mineralogy to carbonatic in 1991, based on Texas A&M University data (S90TX-043-006) and local laboratory calcimeter tests.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 inches (Ak and Bk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 3 to 15 inches (Bk horizons)\nLithic contact - the boundary with hard limestone at 15 inches\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Key to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nUpdate and revisions for the Recorrelation of Brewster County, Texas, Main Part, 2/7/08, CEM.\nRevised for the correlation of Big Bend National Park, TX, Oct. 2010, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
