  "OVERVIEW": "The Antoine series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey marine sediments of Cretaceous age. These soils are on interfluves of the Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain. Slopes are dominantly 1 to 6 percent but can range up to 15 percent.",
