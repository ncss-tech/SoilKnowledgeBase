  "OVERVIEW": "The Acton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the surface layer and moderately rapid to rapid in the subsoil and substratum.   Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 34 inches.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 55 percent in the solum and 20 to 65 percent in the substratum.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Depth to redoximorphic features ranges from 15 to 30 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A or Ap horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular.\nIn undisturbed areas, a discontinuous E horizon occurs in some pedons.  It is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is similar to the A horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to loamy coarse sand with loamy textures restricted to depths shallower than 10 inches from the mineral soil  surface.  Textures also include gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogues.  Structure is massive or weak or moderate, fine or medium granular.  Consistence is typically loose, very friable or friable, but may contain thin subhorizons with firm consistence.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture ranges from loamy sand to coarse sand and includes cobbly and gravelly analogues.  Structure is massive or single grain.  Consistence ranges from loose to firm in place, but is friable on removal.  Rock fragments commonly have silt coatings on their upper surfaces."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:   There are no other series in the same family.  Essex, Gloucester, Millis, Newfields, Scituate, Sudbury, Sutton, and Waumbek soils are in related families.  Essex, Millis and Scituate soils formed in compact glacial till.  Gloucester soils lack redoximorphic features in the B horizon.  Newfields, Sudbury, and Sutton soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Waumbek soils have a frigid soil temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Acton soils are nearly level to steep  soils on glaciated uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in stony sandy glacial till derived mostly from granite gneiss and schistose rocks.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches, and the frost-free season from 110 to 180 days."

Canton, Charlton, and Gloucester soils are on higher positions on the landscape and don't have redoximorphic features in the Bw and C horizons.  Deerfield, Hinckley, and Windsor soils are on outwash landforms and formed in water sorted sand and gravel.  Essex, Montauk, and Scituate soils are smooth sideslopes and formed in compact, loamy glacial till.  Hollis soils are on bedrock controlled landforms and are shallow to bedrock.  Leicester soils are on lower positions on the landscape and have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the  solum.  Newfields soils occupy similar landscape positions and have loamy textures in the solum."
