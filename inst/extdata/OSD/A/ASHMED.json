Bitter, Bitter Spring and Pinaleno soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder in the argillic horizon.

Pinaleno soils are noncalcareous in the upper part of the solum with prominent calcic horizons in lower part. Blind soils contain 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and the argillic horizon extends to 60 inches or more.  Highland soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Peskah, Timosea and Topawa soils contain 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Searchlight soils contain buried Bt horizons and contain 12 to 18 percent clay in the Bt.
