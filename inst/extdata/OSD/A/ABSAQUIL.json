Etelka soils are moderately well drained and on concave side slopes, broad ridges and toeslopes.  Gustin soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on concave side slopes and swales.  Preacher soils are fine-loamy and are on side slopes and broad ridges.  Remote soils are loamy-skeletal and are on convex or more steeply sloping side slopes.
