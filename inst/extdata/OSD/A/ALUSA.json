  "OVERVIEW": "The Alusa series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy and clayey material of Cretaceous age.  These soils are on broad nearly level areas in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B).  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 inches, and mean annual temperature is 61 degrees.",
