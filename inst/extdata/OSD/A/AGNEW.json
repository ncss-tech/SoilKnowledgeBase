The soil is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. This horizon has mottles in some pedons. It has granular or subangular blocky structure. Most areas have been plowed. It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4. It is heavy silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Some pedons have thin layers of silty clay. This horizon has angular blocky or prismatic structure. It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 through 4. It is stratified and is predominantly silt loam and silty clay loam with thinner layers of sandy loam, loamy sand, and loam. It is moderately acid through neutral."

The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, dry summers and cool, moist winter. Average annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches. Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F., average July temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. Frost-free season (28 degrees F.) is 170 to 200 days."
