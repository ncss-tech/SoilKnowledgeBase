  "OVERVIEW": "The Agnew series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in glaciomarine sediments. These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

This horizon has mottles in some pedons. It has granular or subangular blocky structure. Most areas have been plowed. It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4. It is heavy silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Some pedons have thin layers of silty clay. This horizon has angular blocky or prismatic structure. It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 through 4.
