  "OVERVIEW": "The Aragon series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from cherty limestone, sandstone, siltstone and shale.  Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 53 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to unweathered bedrock is 5 to 10 feet.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid, except where the soil has been limed.  Content of chert fragments in each horizon ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of red and brown.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles are none to many in shades of yellow, brown and red or this horizon is mottled in the same colors.  Clay content of the Bt horizons range from 45 to 70 percent and silt content is more than 20 percent.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors the same as the lower Bt horizon.  Texture is variable within short horizontal distances and includes sandy clay loam and silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has texture, color and consistence determined by amounts of limestone, sandstone, shale and siltstone in the underlying material."

Appling, Cataula, Cecil, Chestatee, Georgeville, Herndon, Hulett, Madison, Pacolet, Spotsylvania and Wedowee soils developed in acid crystalline rocks.  Albertville and Townley soils have mixed clay mineralogy.  Capshaw, Mimosa and Talbott soils have base saturation more than 35 percent.  Christian soils have mean annual temperature less than 59 degrees F.  Dewey and Fullerton soils lack a 20 percent clay decrease within 60 inches of the surface.  Ender and Masada soils have mottle free upper B horizons.  Kolomoki, Nankin and Nesses soils are formed in terrace or coastal plain sediments.  Maydon soils are underlain by Trassic rocks.  Nectar soils do not have chert fragments."
