  "OVERVIEW": "The Akela series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in medium to moderately coarse textured very gravelly calcareous material some of which is alluvium from basalt and rhyolitic tuff and some of which is eolian in origin.  Akela soils are on uplands, rolling hills, lava flows, and basalt mountain sides and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

The soils formed in medium to moderately coarse textured very gravelly calcareous material, part of which has been deposited by wind action and part has formed in place from basalt and rhyolitic tuff.  Elevations are 2,000 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is arid to semiarid.  Mean annual rainfall is 4 to 12 inches with a distinct summer maximum.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 170 to 280 days."
