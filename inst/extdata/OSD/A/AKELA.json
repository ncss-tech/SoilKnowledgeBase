  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on gently sloping uplands, rolling hills, lava flows, and steep basalt mountains with 0 to 70 percent slopes.  The soils formed in medium to moderately coarse textured very gravelly calcareous material, part of which has been deposited by wind action and part has formed in place from basalt and rhyolitic tuff.  Elevations are 2,000 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is arid to semiarid.  Mean annual rainfall is 4 to 12 inches with a distinct summer maximum.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 170 to 280 days."
