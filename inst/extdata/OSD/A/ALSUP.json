The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 3.  The E horizon, where present in uneroded areas, has value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, silt, or loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly analogues.  Reaction is neutral to very strongly acid.\nThe upper 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid\nThe lower 2Bt and the 3Bt horizon is multicolored yellow, pale brown, pale olive, red and light gray.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay or their channery or gravelly analogues.  Mottles have hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 3BC and 3C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 7 or it is mottled.  They are silty clay loam, silty clay, clay or the channery analogues of these textures.  In some pedons the shale is interbedded with siltstone or limestone.  Siltstone channers range from 0 to 80 percent by volume.  Up to 50 percent siltstone parafragments are also present in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to neutral."

Aaron soils have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. Brookside soils are more than 60 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Goodson soils have mollic colors in the A horizon and have a base saturation of 60 percent or higher in the lower part of the series control section.  Losantville soils have free carbonates from 8 to 20 inches and are more than 60 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Miamian soils have free carbonates at 18 to 40 inches and are more than 60 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Morrisville soils have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches and have free carbonates from 10 to 30 inches. Shircliff soils have free carbonates from 30 to 60 inches and are more than 60 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Skrainka and Vincent soils are more than 60 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Useful sols have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on upland summits, side slopes, and foot slopes.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 35 percent.  The regolith consists of a mantle of colluvium or loess over residuum from shale.  The shale is interbedded with limestone in many places.  Siltstone and chert fragments are commonly a part of the colluvium.  Beginning at about 9 percent gradient, the size and magnitude of coarse fragments increase rapidly as the slope gradient increases.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Basehor and Gasconade soils are less than 20 inches to hard bedrock and commonly on higher elevations.  Goss soils have more coarse fragments in the particle size control section and are on similar positions.  Pembroke and Peridge soils have less clay in the particle control section.  Pembroke soils are at lower elevations and Peridge soils are on higher elevations. Viraton soils have fragipans and are at higher elevations."
