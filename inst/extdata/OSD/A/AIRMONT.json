  "OVERVIEW": "The Airmont series consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in colluvial or debris flow materials from schist, quartzite and phyllite. They are located in mountain drainageways and concave side slopes and backslopes of the Northern Blue Ridge.  Permeability is slow to very slow throughout. Slopes range from 0 to 50 but are more commonly 3 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of rounded to angular quartzite, schist and phyllite range from gravel to boulder size and occupy 5 to 50 percent of the solum and 35 to 70 percent in the substratum. Rock fragments average less than 35 percent in the particle size control section. An O horizon is commonly present in varying stages of decomposition and thicknesses that range from 1 to 6 inches or more. In some pedons, flakes of mica are few to common. Surface stoniness ranges from 0.01 to 80 percent or more. The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Textures are loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Some areas of the horizon are thin and discontinuous.\nThe E and/or BE horizon (where present) have a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Textures are loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Textures are sandy loam, loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Redoximorphic features, where present, are similar to the matrix colors but include chromas of 1 or 2.\nThe Btx or Bx horizons (where present) have a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 . Textures are loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam and clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Redoximorphic features are similar in color to the matrix, but may include a hue of 5YR and chromas of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon commonly is variegated with hues of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 8. Some pedons have 2C horizons, mainly in footslope positions. Textures are dominantly sandy loam, loamy sand and loam, but can include sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

The Cardova, Dekalb, Hazel, and Stumptown soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and are well drained. Braddock soils are well drained and average more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Thurmont soils are well drained and are on footslopes, fans and terraces of the Blue Ridge. Bagtown soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Edgemont soils are well drained and occupy mountain ridges and backslopes. Gunnstock and Whiteford soils are well drained and formed in residuum from phyllite and/or slate. Sylvatus soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and formed from phyllite."

In 2002, series was re-evaluated by participants from West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland. In 12/2003 the type location was moved to Jefferson County, West Virginia and textural family changed back to fine-loamy and sub/great group changed from Aquic Fragiudults to Fragiaquic Hapludults.\nLast revision Rev. JCB-MAV 12/2003.  This revision, 11/2006, was done to increase the range in surface stoniness percent and update the associated soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
