    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series name comes from a river in the survey area. Salinity and sodicity have been modified by farming practices. Gypsum, where present, was added to the soil by farmers.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\n1.0 Ochric epipedon -- The zone from 0 to 16 inches depth    (Ap1, Ap2 horizons).\n2.0 Cambic horizon -- removal of calcium carbonate and soil structure (Bw horizon).\n3.0 Carbonates\n3.1 Disseminated calcium carbonate in the surface and cambic horizon. (Ap1, Ap2 and Bw horizons).\n3.2 Segregated calcium carbonate as soft masses (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\n4. Coarse-loamy family\n4.1 Soil has 8 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the 10 to 40 inch control section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
