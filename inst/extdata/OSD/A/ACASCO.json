    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. Thickness of the solum and depth to sand and gravel ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section above the discontinuity range from 10 to 35 percent. Fine or coarser sand in the control section above the discontinuity ranges from 15 to 35 percent and clay ranges from 35 to 45 percent. Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR in most pedons, but thin subhorizons of 5YR are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2. It has faint through prominent mottles. It is 27 to 40 percent clay. This horizon is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has distinct or prominent mottles. This horizon is gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay with 35 to 45 percent clay."

These soils formed in alluvial materials derived principally from basalt. At the type location, the average annual precipitation is about 7 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 degrees to 43 degrees F. and mean annual summer temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F."
