  "OVERVIEW": "The Agee series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils.  They are on broad flat areas in limestone valleys and less commonly on low stream terraces and flood plains.  The soil formed in clayey alluvium or partly in clayey alluvium and partly in the underlying clayey residuum of limestone.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness. Coarse fragments are normally absent, but some pedons have up to 5 percent of small limestone fragments or gravel.  COLE values range from 0.07 to 0.095 in all layers to a depth of 40 or more inches.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  In some pedons the Ap horizon also has a chroma of 3.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features of higher chroma range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Cg horizon, and BC or CB horizons where present, have the same colors and textures as the Bg horizon or is an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color."
