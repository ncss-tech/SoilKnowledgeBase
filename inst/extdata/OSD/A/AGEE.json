  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to  moderately acid in each horizon. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness. Coarse fragments are normally absent, but some pedons have up to 5 percent of small limestone fragments or gravel.  COLE values range from 0.07 to 0.095 in all layers to a depth of 40 or more inches.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  In some pedons the Ap horizon also has a chroma of 3.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features of higher chroma range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Cg horizon, and BC or CB horizons where present, have the same colors and textures as the Bg horizon or is an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color."

Dospalos soils are in a climate with a mean annual precipitation of 11 inches and the soil formed in mixed alluvium from granitic sources.

The soil formed in clayey alluvium or alluvium and the underlying clayey residuum of limestone.  The average annual temperature is about 58 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 52 inches near the type location."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eagleville,  Capshaw, Egam, Godwin and Talbott series.  Capshaw soils are on adjacent terraces. They have an argillic horizon and do not have a mollic epipedon. Egam and Godwin soils are on flood plains, are better drained, and have mollic epipedons greater than 24 inches thick.  Talbott soils are on adjacent uplands have an argillic horizon and are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly correlated in the Roellen series in Middle Tennessee.  The Roellen series is on flood plains of the major rivers in West Tennessee, Arkansas, etc.\nLaboratory data from Beltsville, Maryland is available on one pedon.  It supports  smectitic mineralogy and a Vertic subgroup.  Field measurements support a Vertic subgroup.  COLE ranges from 0.07 to 0.095.\nDiagnostic horizons in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 21 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - 21 to 53 inches (Bg horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
