  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Atlee series was formerly classified as a fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Fragiudults.  The change to Fragiaquic Paleudults is based on field studies which showed that although the Atlee soils had a horizon which was hard and very firm, this horizon was not brittle in more than 60 percent of its volume.  The mineralogy has been changed to siliceous due to petrographic analysis of two pedons and also to the associated soils.\nDiagnostic Horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches\nArgillic Horizons - the zone from 14 to 60 inches\nFragiaquic - the zone with 40 to 60 percent brittleness (26 to\n53inches)\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nVA0038 ATLEE       0- 10   59- 64  195-220  40- 48    25- 250\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nVA0038 NONE          1.5-2.5  APPARENT NOV-MAR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nVA0038  0-10  SIL L VFSL              0-  0  95-100  7-15    -\nVA0038  0-10  SL FSL                  0-  0  95-100  7-15    -\nVA0038 10-26  SIL L CL                0-  0  95-100 10-30    -\nVA0038 26-52  CL SICL L               0-  0  95-100 18-35    -\nVA0038 52-87  CL SICL C               0-  0  95-100 20-45    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
