Bowie, Carnegie, Clarendon, Colfax, Cowarts, Irvington, Robertsdale, and Saucier soils are in closely related families.  The Ardilla and Cedarbluff soils have either soft spheriodal masses or nodules of plinthite.   Eylau soils have tongues and interfingers of E material in Bt horizons in the lower part of the solum.  The Bowie and Carnegie soils do not have low chroma mottles within 30 inches of the soils surface.  The Clarendon, Cowarts, and Saucier soils do not have a horizon that is brittle in 40 to 60 percent of its volume; in addition, they have a subhorizon within 60 inches of the soil surface with more than 5 percent plinthite.  The Colfax, Irvington, and Robertsdale soils have fragipans; in addition, the Irvington and Robertsdale soils have a subhorizon within 60 inches of the soil surface that has more than 5 percent plinthite."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Atlee series was formerly classified as a fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Fragiudults.  The change to Fragiaquic Paleudults is based on field studies which showed that although the Atlee soils had a horizon which was hard and very firm, this horizon was not brittle in more than 60 percent of its volume.  The mineralogy has been changed to siliceous due to petrographic analysis of two pedons and also to the associated soils.\nDiagnostic Horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches\nArgillic Horizons - the zone from 14 to 60 inches\nFragiaquic - the zone with 40 to 60 percent brittleness (26 to\n53inches)\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nVA0038 ATLEE       0- 10   59- 64  195-220  40- 48    25- 250\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nVA0038 NONE          1.5-2.5  APPARENT NOV-MAR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nVA0038  0-10  SIL L VFSL              0-  0  95-100  7-15    -\nVA0038  0-10  SL FSL                  0-  0  95-100  7-15    -\nVA0038 10-26  SIL L CL                0-  0  95-100 10-30    -\nVA0038 26-52  CL SICL L               0-  0  95-100 18-35    -\nVA0038 52-87  CL SICL C               0-  0  95-100 20-45    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
