The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and the depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  It is weakly or moderately smeary.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is 12 to 18 percent clay (by field estimate) and 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam.  It is 18 to 27 percent clay (by field estimate) and 30 to 50 percent basalt gravel and 5 to 20 percent basalt cobbles.\nThe BC horizon has 10 to 40 percent basalt gravel and 20 to 50 percent basalt cobbles.  It is extremely cobbly loam, extremely gravelly loam or very cobbly silt loam."
