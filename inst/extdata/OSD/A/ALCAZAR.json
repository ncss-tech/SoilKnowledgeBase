  "OVERVIEW": "The Alcazar series consists of very deep, well drained moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium.  These level soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
