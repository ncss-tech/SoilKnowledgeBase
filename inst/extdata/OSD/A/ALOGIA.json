  "OVERVIEW": "The Alogia series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from redbed sandstones and shales.  These soils are on nearly level seep areas and drainages of alluvial fans and terraces adjoining flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 13 to 21 inches.  Secondary carbonates are being redeposited in the argillic horizon, and in some areas the depth to secondary carbonates is as shallow as two inches.  Depth to gypsum and salts more soluble than gypsum typically ranges from 0 to 15 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  These soils have a fluctuating seasonal water table at 40 to 60 inches.  The gypsum content seems to preclude the development of gleyed colors in the substratum.  These soils contain less than 5 percent pebbles throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and 2 through 6 moist.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 6 moist.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.   Electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos/cm.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 8 dry and moist.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 12 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline. Electrical conductivity ranges from 4 to 8 mmhos/cm.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 20 percent, and gypsum ranges from  10 to 20 percent.\nThe 2Cy and 2C horizons, if present, have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 8 dry and moist.  Texture may be variable and the C may be stratified in some pedons below 40 inches.  Common textures are clay loam, loam, silt loam, and less commonly sandy loam.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent, and gypsum ranges from 10 to 20 percent."

Antonito, Bluerim, Bonfri, Cushool, Cutback, Diamondville, Diamonkit, Rawah, Regnaps, Satanka, and Wycolo soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  The Anchutz, Fluetsch, Forelle, Harsha, Rock River, Stunner, and Stylite soils have hues of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y in the Bt horizon and are well drained."
