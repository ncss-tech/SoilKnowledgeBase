(AE and Bt horizons)\nThe 11/2006 revision moves the typical pedon to the pedon used in the update survey of the Santa Fe Area. The classification was also revised from fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Ustollic Haplargids to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Paleargids. The series range in characteristics was re-written to comprise only the Agu Fria soils in the Santa Fe update survey.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
