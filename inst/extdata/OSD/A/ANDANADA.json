  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Andanada soils are on shoulders of mesas and undulating plateaus. They formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived locally from early Quaternary age Cuerbio Basalt formation. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,700 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Ildefonso soils have calcic horizons, are very deep, and occur on backslopes.  Parida soils are coarse-loamy, are very deep, and occur on footslopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches. (Ak horizon)\nLithic contact - The presence of indurated basalt bedrock at 9 inches. (2R layer)\nDespite the dark colors, a mollic epipedon is not recognized in this soil because it is not moist in some part for greater than 90 days.  A calcic horizon is not recognized because this soil typically has less than 5 percent identifiable secondary carbonates and/or the horizon is less than 15cm thick.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
