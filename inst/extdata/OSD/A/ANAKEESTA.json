  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid. Content of rock fragments ranges from 15 percent to 75 percent by volume in the A, BA, and upper Bw horizons, and 50 to 80 percent by volume in the lower Bw horizons.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Colors with value and chroma of 3 or less are mainly derived from the high content of graphite in the underlying parent material.\nThe R horizon is primarily slate bedrock. Some interbedding with metasandstone occurs. Excavation difficulty is very high with very strongly cemented hardness."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Anakeesta soils are on moderately steep to very steep side slopes, summits, and on heath balds in the high elevations of the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Slope ranges from 15 to 95 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,200 feet to over 6,600 feet.  Anakeesta soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks, primarily slate. Some interbedding with metasandstone occurs. These soils are commonly associated with geologic formations that contain a high amount of sulfidic material, mainly in the form of pyrite. Landscape instability is a concern, especially where the dip in the bedrock is along the same inclination as the slope.  There is increased potential for damage to streams and aquatic life when pyrite is exposed by debris slides or development activities. Moist atmospheric conditions in the form of fog and cloud cover are prevalent throughout the year in these high mountain areas. Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches."

Clingman and Pinnacle soils are comprised of organic soil material. Heintooga and Horsetrough soils formed in colluvium on adjacent toe slopes, benches, and fans in coves and have bedrock at depths greater than 60 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is in public ownership and is used for watershed protection, recreation, and wildlife habitat. In areas higher than about 5,400 feet, red spruce and fraser fir are the dominant trees. At the lower elevations, northern red oak, black oak, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and yellow buckeye are common trees. Common understory plants are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, silverbell, pin cherry, rhododendron, flame azalea, and blueberry. Common forbs are hay-scented fern, woodfern, New York fern, Solomons seal, yellow mandarin, and trillium. Acreage covered by heath balds is vegetated with rhododendron, mountain laurel, blueberry, flame azalea, hawthorn, and mountain ash."
