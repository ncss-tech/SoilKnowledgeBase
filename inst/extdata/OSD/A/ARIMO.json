  "OVERVIEW": "The Arimo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with loess influence. Arimo soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
