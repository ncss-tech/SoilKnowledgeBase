Auten soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 197 to 259 meters (650 to 850 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alida, Brady, Coupee, Quinn, Rensselaer, and Tracy soils. Alida and Brady soils are on similar positions but do not have contrasting textures. Coupee and Tracy are well drained soils on slightly higher elevations and formed in similar materials as Auten soils. Quinn soils are poorly drained and are on lower elevations. Tracy soils have less clay in the B horizon and have a lighter colored surface layer."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between November and May in normal years.\nPotential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy materials and high or very high in the underlying sandy materials. Permeability is moderate in the loamy materials and rapid in the underlying sandy materials."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to 9 inches (Ap horizon); fits the definition of a mollic epipedon since the thickness is 1/3 or more the total thickness between the mineral surface and the base of the argillic horizon. However, it is not a Mollisol because the Bg and BC horizons above a depth of 125 cm have less than 50 percent base saturation.\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 56 cm (9 to 22 inches) (Bt horizon).\nAquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below 23 cm (9 inches).\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 401618 represents the typical pedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data for the typical pedon (S01IN-141-003) is being analyzed at the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T01IN-141-141) is on file at the MLRA project office in Plymouth, IN. Transect shows 100 percent Auten soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
