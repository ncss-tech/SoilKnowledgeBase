  "OVERVIEW": "The Auten series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash on outwash plains, terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Tracy soils have less clay in the B horizon and have a lighter colored surface layer."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to 9 inches (Ap horizon); fits the definition of a mollic epipedon since the thickness is 1/3 or more the total thickness between the mineral surface and the base of the argillic horizon. However, it is not a Mollisol because the Bg and BC horizons above a depth of 125 cm have less than 50 percent base saturation.\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 56 cm (9 to 22 inches) (Bt horizon).\nAquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below 23 cm (9 inches).\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 401618 represents the typical pedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data for the typical pedon (S01IN-141-003) is being analyzed at the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T01IN-141-141) is on file at the MLRA project office in Plymouth, IN. Transect shows 100 percent Auten soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
