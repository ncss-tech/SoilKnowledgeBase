  "OVERVIEW": "The Azuvina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium weathered from granitic sources. Azuvina soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants, often in urban areas where surface modification is common. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.",
