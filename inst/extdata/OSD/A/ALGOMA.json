  "OVERVIEW": "The Algoma consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in stratified lacustrine deposits. Algoma soils are on drained lake bottoms and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F. The soils are wet throughout in most months unless drained. Some part of the mollic epipedon has more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium, decreasing at depth below 20 inches. The section between depths of 10 and 20 inches is calcareous in all parts.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick and has estimated bulk density from 0.4 to 0.7 gm/cc. The silty upper part of the soil has an exchange complex dominated by amorphous material. Depth to the sandy IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of neutral or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of neutral or 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry. It commonly is mottled or has neutral hue."

Cocolalla, Conboy, Tisch and Tulana soils lack contrasting textures and are noncalcareous throughout. Cummings soils predominantly are silty clay loam in the control section, lack contrasting textures, and have frigid soil temperature. Teeters soils lack the contrasting sandy C horizons to depth over 40 inches."

The soils formed in recent lake sediments consisting of diatoms, ash and similar materials in the upper part and fine sand in the lower part. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  the mean January temperature is 27 degrees to 29 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 65 degrees to 69 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 49 degrees F.
