  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Abra soils are at elevations of 4600 to 6800 feet on nearly level to moderately steep fan terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The regolith consists of mixed alluvium from granite, basalt, limestone, sandstone and schist. These soils are in a cool semiarid, continental climate, having a mean annual air temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  Precipitation occurs as thunderstorms in July through September and as gentle rain or snow showers during the winter months. The frost- free period ranges from 120 to 180 days. In Colorado this soil has a frost-free period as short as 110 days, mean annual precipitation as much as 14 inches and a mean annual air temperature as low as 46 degrees F."
