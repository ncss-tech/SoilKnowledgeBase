  "OVERVIEW": "The Alona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from stratified sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean air annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Alona soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nClassification changed from Borollic Camborthids to Aridic Ustochrepts in 1993.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data S74MT-55-3 is a similar pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
