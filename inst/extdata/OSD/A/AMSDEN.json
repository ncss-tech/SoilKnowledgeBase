  "OVERVIEW": "The Amsden series consists of deep, well drained soil that formed in sediments mainly from redbed shale and siltstone. Amsden soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of about 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 15 to 30 inches. The solum is 15 to 40 inches thick. Organic carbon ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the surface horizon and decreases uniformly with depth. Gravel is 0 to 12 percent. Cobbles are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F., without an O horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. Typically its primary structure is granular or crumb, but is subangular blocky in some pedons. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam or clay loam and has 1 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 45 percent sand, with less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R. It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 6 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Croydon, Lyonman, Newlands, and Youga soils are noncalcareous. Gelkie soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the B2t horizon. Hourglass soils lack a Ca horizon. Keazar, Lucky, Lymanson, Miracle, Mult, Passcreek, Sponseller, Tripit, and Woosley soils have bedrock at depths above 40 inches.  Leavitt, Morset, and Tingey soils lack a lithochromic hue of 7.5YR or redder. Michelson, Philipsburg, and Wellsville soils have calcic horizons."

The soils formed in thick, calcareous, reddish-colored sediments derived principally from calcareous redbed shale and siltstone. At the type location the annual average temperature is about 36 degrees F., and the summer temperature is about 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. The frost-free season is 60 to 65 days but frost may occur in any summer month."
