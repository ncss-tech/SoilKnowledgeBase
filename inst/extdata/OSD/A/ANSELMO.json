  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 28 to 102 centimeters (11 to 40 inches), and the depth to carbonates ranges from 66 to more than 152 centimeters (26 to more than 60 inches).  The mollic epipedon ranges from 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) in thickness and includes part of the upper B horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam; but loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand are in the range.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically fine sandy loam, but loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand are included.  Texture frequently becomes coarser with depth.  Stratification caused by wind reworking is present in the C horizon of some pedons.  Silty and loamy strata below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) are common in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Anselmo soils are on uplands and stream terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in loamy and sandy eolian material.  The range of mean annual air temperature is 7 to 14 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F).  The average annual precipitation ranges from 460 to 610 millimeters (18 to 24 inches)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dunday, Hall, Hersh, Holdrege, O'Neill, Valentine and Vetal soils.  Dunday soils have more sand in the control section and are on similar landscape.  Hall and Holdrege soils have fine-silty argillic horizons and are predominantly on nearly level slopes below Anselmo soils.  Hersh soils lack a mollic epipedon and occur on similar landscapes.  O'Neill soils developed over mixed sand and gravel, and are on similar landscapes.  Valentine soils are sandy and usually are on more hummocky landscapes.  Vetal soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick and are lower in the landscape."

The principal crops are corn, winter wheat, milo and alfalfa.  The common native grasses are little bluestem, sand bluestem, needleandthread, prairie sandreed, western wheatgrass and blue grama."
