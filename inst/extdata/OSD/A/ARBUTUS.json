  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. HEL-TAM-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "07/2009",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arbutus series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils which formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of siliceous sandy alluvium overlying igneous or metamorphic bedrock.  These soils are on strath terraces.  Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
