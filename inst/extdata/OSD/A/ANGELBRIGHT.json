  "OVERVIEW": "The Angelbright series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from dolomite or dolomitic limestone. Angelbright soils are on summits and shoulders of hills and ridges on plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
