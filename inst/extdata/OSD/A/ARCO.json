    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mooretown,  Borah, Blackfoot, and Sancrane soils.  Mooretown soils are on valley flats, have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections, and have mollic epipedons that are 30 to 60 inches thick.  Borah soils are on valley flats, have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections, and have mollic epipedons that are 20 to 40 inches thick.  Blackfoot soils are on flood plains and low terraces and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Sancrane soils are on flood plains and stream terraces, are poorly drained, and are 20 to 35 inches to strongly contrasting textures."
