The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The solum and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has 12 to 27 percent clay (by field estimate).  The solum has a moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.85g/cubic centimeter and is weakly or moderately smeary.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments of which 0 to 5 percent are basalt gravel and 0 to 5 percent are 2 to 5 mm concretions.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and 6 to 8 dry. ; The upper part is silt loam and some pedons have about 5 percent fine concretions. The lower part below 40 inches is silt loam or silty clay loam with 0 to 15 percent basalt gravel."

The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.  The mean July temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 35 to 37 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.

It has a solum depth of 30 to 40 inches, has 10 to 18 percent clay (apparent field texture) in the Bw horizon, and is dominated by Mt. St. Helens ash."
