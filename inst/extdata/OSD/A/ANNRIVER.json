    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 40 inches. The depth to stratified sandy outwash ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 15 percent in the loamy lower subsoil.  Volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 10 to 50 percent as a weighted average, but some pedons may have individual strata with less than 10 percent gravel.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is commonly silt loam, but includes very fine sandy loam or loam high in very fine sand. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nAn E/B or B/E horizon is in some pedons and has the same color and texture ranges as the Eg and Bt horizons.  It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is silt loam or silty clay loam but includes very fine sandy loam or loam high in very fine sand.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Btg or 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.   It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt horizon with color like the 2Bt described above.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly and very gravelly analogues.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sand, coarse sand or their gravelly and very gravelly analogues.  It is strongly acid to neutral."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Annriver soils typically are on outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in a silty mantle of loess or lacustrine deposits overlying loamy alluvium and sandy outwash.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 24 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 145 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1700 feet."

Redoximorphic features in the E horizon are used as field indicators to soil saturation.
