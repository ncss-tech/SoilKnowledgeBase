  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashdos series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks.  Ashdos soils are on plateaus, hills, ash flows, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
