  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ashdos soils are on plateaus, hills, ash flows, and mountains.  They occur on north-facing shoulders and backslopes.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks of pyroclastic origin.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range 1,475 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
