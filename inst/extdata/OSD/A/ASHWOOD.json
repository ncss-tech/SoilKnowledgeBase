  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Cracks as much as about 1/2 inch in width extend to a depth of about 15 inches during long dry periods. The mollic epipedon extends into the upper part of the Bt horizon in most pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in A and B horizons and 5 to 25 percent in the BC and C horizons.\nThe A and BA horizons and upper part of the Bt horizon in most pedons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 2 or 3.   The A and BA horizons are silt loam, silty clay loam, or rarely silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon below the mollic epipedon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, olive or gray in the lower part.  The Bt horizon is clay or silty clay.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, brown, or olive.  Texture of the fine earth is clay or silty clay."

Barfield soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Dennis soils do not have bedrock within a 60-inch depth.  Eram soils have mottles with chroma of 2 within 6 inches of the lower boundary of the mollic epipedon. Egam and Godwin soils lack argillic horizons and have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Summit soils have vertic properties."
