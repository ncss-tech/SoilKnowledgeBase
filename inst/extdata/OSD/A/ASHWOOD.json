  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Cracks as much as about 1/2 inch in width extend to a depth of about 15 inches during long dry periods. The mollic epipedon extends into the upper part of the Bt horizon in most pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in A and B horizons and 5 to 25 percent in the BC and C horizons.\nThe A and BA horizons and upper part of the Bt horizon in most pedons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 2 or 3.   The A and BA horizons are silt loam, silty clay loam, or rarely silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon below the mollic epipedon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, olive or gray in the lower part.  The Bt horizon is clay or silty clay.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, brown, or olive.  Texture of the fine earth is clay or silty clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

Barfield soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Dennis soils do not have bedrock within a 60-inch depth.  Eram soils have mottles with chroma of 2 within 6 inches of the lower boundary of the mollic epipedon. Egam and Godwin soils lack argillic horizons and have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Summit soils have vertic properties."
