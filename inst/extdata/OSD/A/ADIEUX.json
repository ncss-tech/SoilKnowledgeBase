The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 8 to 18 inches is dry in all parts from about July 1 to November 1 (120 days).  The soil moisture control section is dry less than half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 29 inches thick.  Rock fragments make up 0 to 15 percent of the soil profile.  Stones and cobbles cover 0 to 3 percent of the soil surface.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.
