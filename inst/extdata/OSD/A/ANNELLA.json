    "section": "SERIES PROPOSED",
    "content": "SERIES PROPOSED:  Rio Grande County, Rio Grande National Forest, West Part soil survey area, 2008. This series was drafted for use in the adjoining Archuleta and Piedra soil survey areas, using the modal pedon for the Leighcan series from the Rio Grande National Forest Area. This pedon no longer fits the Leighcan series because of its parent material lithology and its content of volcanic glass and oxalate Fe and Al content (Vitrandic feature); these Vitrandic features were not known until recently. The name is taken from a small lake a few miles from the type location in Conejos County."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nCambic horizon:  35 to 79 cm (Bs1, Bs2 horizons)\nVitrandic feature: 35 to 79 cm (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section:  35 to 110 cm (Bs1, Bs2, and part of C1 horizon)\nThe cambic horizon does not qualify for a spodic horizon because it does not have twice the amount of acid oxalate Al+1/2Fe or twice the ODOE as the E horizon.\nAnnella soils have a cryic soil temperature regime and are in a udic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL sample S84CO105-004 (sampled as Leighcan).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
