  "OVERVIEW": "The Annella series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from tuff and breccia.  Annella soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 1.1 degrees C.",

    "content": "SERIES PROPOSED:  Rio Grande County, Rio Grande National Forest, West Part soil survey area, 2008. This series was drafted for use in the adjoining Archuleta and Piedra soil survey areas, using the modal pedon for the Leighcan series from the Rio Grande National Forest Area. This pedon no longer fits the Leighcan series because of its parent material lithology and its content of volcanic glass and oxalate Fe and Al content (Vitrandic feature); these Vitrandic features were not known until recently. The name is taken from a small lake a few miles from the type location in Conejos County."
