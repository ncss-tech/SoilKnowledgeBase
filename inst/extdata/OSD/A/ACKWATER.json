The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.  Aluminum saturation on the exchanges complex is commonly greater than 50 percent, and commonly ranges from 5 to 15 meq/100 grams of soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  In eroded areas, texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe E horizon,where present, has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: (This section not reviewed this date; series reclassified as fine and subactive) These are the Angie, Chrysler,and Tiak. Similar soils in related families include Caroline, Duplin, and Persanti.  Angie soils have an apparent water table at 36 to 60 inches and climatic conditions which result in lower crop yields.  Chrysler soils dominately have redder hue in the Bt horizon and low shrink-swell potential in the substratum.    Tiak soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon.  Caroline soils do not have low chroma mottles within 30 inches of the surface.  Duplin and Persanti soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING  Ackwater soils are on nearly level to steep landscapes of the upper Coastal Plain.  They formed in fluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches near the type location.  Elevation at type location is about 130 feet."

Aycock and Montross soils are on similar landscape positions and have a fine-silty particle-size control section.  In addition, Montross soils have between 40 and 60 percent brittleness in the Bt horizon.  Emporia and Norfolk soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Kinston soils are on nearby floodplains and are frequently flooded."

The principal crops are corn, soybeans, wheat and barley.  Important tree species include loblolly pine, southern red oak, white oak, yellow-poplar, and sweetgum."
