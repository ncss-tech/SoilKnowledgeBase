    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: (This section not reviewed this date; series reclassified as fine and subactive) These are the Angie, Chrysler,and Tiak. Similar soils in related families include Caroline, Duplin, and Persanti.  Angie soils have an apparent water table at 36 to 60 inches and climatic conditions which result in lower crop yields.  Chrysler soils dominately have redder hue in the Bt horizon and low shrink-swell potential in the substratum.    Tiak soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon.  Caroline soils do not have low chroma mottles within 30 inches of the surface.  Duplin and Persanti soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING  Ackwater soils are on nearly level to steep landscapes of the upper Coastal Plain.  They formed in fluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches near the type location.  Elevation at type location is about 130 feet."
