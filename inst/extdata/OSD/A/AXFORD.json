Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The soil reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam or gravelly loam, and contains 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent and moderately to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Axford soils are on gently sloping to  steep north-facing side slopes of canyons.  Elevation is 1200 to 2800 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 55 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from basalt with an influence of loess in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
