  "OVERVIEW": "The Arbone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Arbone soils are on fan terraces, foothills, toe slopes, and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Permeability is moderate. The mean annual precipitation is 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Lanoak soils are fine-silty and lack calcic horizons within 40 inches. Newdale, Rexburg, Ririe, and Wheelerville soils are coarse-silty. In addition, Wheelerville soils lack mollic epipedons. Wahtigup soils are fine-loamy. Cedarhill soils are on hillslopes associated with limestone parent material. Hondoho soils are on terraces and footslopes in areas of more gravelly parent material. Lanoak soils are on north and east-facing slopes. Newdale, Rexburg, Ririe, and Wheelerville soils are on loess-mantled fan terraces. Wahtigup soils are on south-facing slopes associated with limestone parent material."
