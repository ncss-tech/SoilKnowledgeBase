    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from sandstone and quartzite with lesser amounts of limestone and basalt. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 75 to 100 days. Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 6,900 feet."

Lanoak soils are fine-silty and lack calcic horizons within 40 inches. Newdale, Rexburg, Ririe, and Wheelerville soils are coarse-silty. In addition, Wheelerville soils lack mollic epipedons. Wahtigup soils are fine-loamy. Cedarhill soils are on hillslopes associated with limestone parent material. Hondoho soils are on terraces and footslopes in areas of more gravelly parent material. Lanoak soils are on north and east-facing slopes. Newdale, Rexburg, Ririe, and Wheelerville soils are on loess-mantled fan terraces. Wahtigup soils are on south-facing slopes associated with limestone parent material."
