  "OVERVIEW": "The Atomic series consists of deep, well drained soils  formed in alluvium from loess.  Atomic soils are on basalt plans,  alluvial fan terraces, and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
