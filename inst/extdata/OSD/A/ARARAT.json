The moisture control section of o8 to 24 inches is moist throughout from about November 15 to June 1 and dry throughout from about July 1 to October 15 in most years.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F from December 15 to March 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Stones and boulders cover up 15 to 30 percent of the soil surface.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 4 percent in the upper 20 inches.  Some pedons have a thin C horizon.  Base saturation (sum of cations) ranges from 50 to 75 percent throughout to at least a depth of 30 inches.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 4/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/2, or 3/3.  It is extremely stony loam in the upper part and very stony loam, very bouldery loam, or very stony sandy clay loam in the lower part with 16 to 26 percent clay content.
