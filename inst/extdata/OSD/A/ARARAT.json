The soils formed in material weathered from volcanic tuff conglomerate of the Quien Sabe Formation.  Stones and boulders occupy 15 to 30 percent of the surface.  The climate is semi-arid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 190 to 240 days."
