    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for rangeland and small areas of irrigated cropland. Where cultivated, the principal crops are small grains and grain sorghum. Climax vegetation in rangeland is mainly short and mid grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate, with a smaller tall grass component. This site is dominated by blue grama with lesser amounts of sideoats grama, buffalograss, little bluestem, gaura, plains zinnia, prairieclover, bundleflower, wild alfalfa, and ephedra. Woody plants include catclaw sensitivebrier, yucca, and sand sagebrush. Dominant vegetation on the loamy fine sands includes sideoats grama, bluestems, and switchgrass, and on the fine sandy loams includes sideoats grama, blue grama, buffalograss, and Arizona cottontop. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077DY047TX) and Sandy (R077DY046TX) ecological sites in MLRA-77D."

    "content": "REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series. The Amarose series was formerly included in the Amarillo series. Classification change from Aridic Haplustalfs to Ustic Calciargids based on an evaluation of the geographic extent of these soils, and the climate in which they occur. Cation exchange activity class placement in the superactive class is based on laboratory data from the type location, and laboratory data from similar and adjacent soils. The average of the control section is 0.58. Since adjacent and similar soils are in the superactive class, the decision is made to place this soil in the superactive cation exchange activity class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 26 cm (0 to 10 in) Ap horizons\nArgillic Horizon: 26 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) Bt and Btk horizons\nCalcic horizon: 106 to 203 cm (42 to 80 in) Btk horizons\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Laboratory Data available - Roosevelt County, New Mexico (S06NM041003).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
