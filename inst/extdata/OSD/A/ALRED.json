  "OVERVIEW": "The Alred series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in cherty hillslope sediments and the underlying clayey residuum. These soils are on moderately sloping to very steep uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
