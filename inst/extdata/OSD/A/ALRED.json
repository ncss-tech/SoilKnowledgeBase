    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Alred soils are on moderately sloping to strongly sloping narrow ridgetops and moderately steep to very steep sideslopes of hills. They formed in cherty hillslope sediments and the underlying clayey residuum.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Elevations are commonly 600 to 1,050 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Bardley soils are moderately deep to dolomite, have a very fine particle size control section and on are similar positions.  Bendavis soils are moderately deep to chert bedrock, have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and are on lower side slopes.  Gasconade soils are very shallow and shallow to dolomite and are on similar positions.  Goss soils have a clayey-skeletal and are on similar landscape positions.  Lecoma soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section and are on high stream terraces below the Alred soils. Mano soils are moderately well drained and are on similar positions.  Ocie soils are moderately well drained, have bedrock from 40 to 60 inches in depth and are on similar landscape positions."
