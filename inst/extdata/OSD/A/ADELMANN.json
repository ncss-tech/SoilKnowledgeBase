  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Adelmann soils are on southerly facing hill backslopes and footslopes, fan remnants, butte escarpments and structural benches. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium (commonly landslide deposits) from lacustrine deposits mixed with volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The elevation ranges from 2,875 to 4,100 feet. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches and the average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."
