  "OVERVIEW": "The Adelmann series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in alluvium and colluvium from lacustrine deposits mixed with volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
