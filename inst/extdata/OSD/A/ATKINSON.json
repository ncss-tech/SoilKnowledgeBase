  "OVERVIEW": "The Atkinson series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loamy sediments with or without a thin paleosol over limestone bedrock. These soils are on ridges of narrow interfluves, crests and side slopes on uplands, high structural benches, and strath terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",
