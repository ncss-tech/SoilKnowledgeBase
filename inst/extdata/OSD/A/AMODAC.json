Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15 percent throughout.  The particle-size control section is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  A vesicular crust is on some pedons.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  ESP ranges from 15 to 30.  EC ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos.\nThe Bnk or Bnky horizon in some pedons has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  ESP ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  EC ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos.  It is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.
