  "REVDATE": "02/1999",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Amodac series consists of deep, well drained soils that\nformed in material weathered mainly from sodic shale.  They are on convex slopes of rolling uplands.  Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  A vesicular crust is on some pedons.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.
