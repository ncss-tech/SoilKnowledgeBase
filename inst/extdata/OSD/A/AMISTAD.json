  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the soil less than 20 mm is 40 to 80 percent.\nThe A horizon contains 35 to 75 percent by volume of thin, flat fragments of limestone and caliche.  The surface is covered with 40 to 90 percent thin flat fragments of limestone and caliche that are less than 15 inches long and less than 3 inches thick.  The A horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/2; 10YR 5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 10YR 4/3).  Texture of the A horizon, exclusive of coarse fragments, is loam or clay loam with a clay content of 22 to 35 percent.\nThe Bkm horizon has an estimated hardness of 2 through 3 on Moh's scale and is uniformly plugged with carbonates.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon, 24 to 36 inches thick, of weakly cemented caliche and limestone below the Bkm horizon.\nThe underlying bedrock is flaggy limestone, interbedded with flaggy sandstone and ironstone.  The flagstones have reddish, grayish, or brownish colors and range in thickness from 1/8 inch to 10 inches and in length from 2 to 72 inches.  Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 8 to 36 inches."

Similar soils include the Boracho, Cho, Eckrant, Ector, Jimenez, Kimbrough, Langtry, Lozier, Olmos, Queeny, Real, Talpa, Tarrant, Volco, and Zorra series.  Boracho, Eckrant, Kimbrough, Jimenez, Queeny, Talpa, Tarrant, and Volco soils have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the soil fraction less than 20 mm. In addition, Eckrant, Talpa, Tarrant, and Volco soils, as well as Ector, Langtry, and Real soils, lack petrocalcic horizons.  Cho soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Jimenez, Olmos, and Zorra soils have mean annual soil temperature more than 72 degrees F.  Lozier soils lack mollic epipedons.  Eckrant and Tarrant soils have more than 35 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Amistad soils are in undulating to hilly uplands.  Slope gradients are mainly 1 to 8 percent but range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed from Cretaceous Age flaggy limestone like those of the Boquillas formation.  The climate is semiarid.  Average annual rainfall ranges from 12 to 20 inches, Thornthwaite P-E indices from 16 to 32, and mean annual temperatures from 67 degrees to 72 degrees F."

Ector soils occur at higher elevations along the northern and eastern most occurrence of\nAmistad soils.  Langtry, Olmos, and Zorra soils are on similar surfaces.  Langtry soils are along the western fringes of occurrence of Amistad soils.  Olmos and Zorra soils border the southern areas of Amistad soils."
