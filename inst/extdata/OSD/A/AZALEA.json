  "OVERVIEW": "The Azalea series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum weathered from granitic rocks. The Azalea soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1110 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
