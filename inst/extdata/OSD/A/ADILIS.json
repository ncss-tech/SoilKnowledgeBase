  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Adilis soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the very gravelly sandy IIC horizon ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The upper part of the control section is usually gravelly sandy loam, but ranges from 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 42 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Loamy fine sand or coarser textures are excluded from the above range.  Rock fragments in this layer range from 0 to 35 percent by volume and range in diameter from 1/4 to 10 inches but are typically less than 3 inches in diameter.  The lower part of the control section is gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand or sand.  The A and C horizons range from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Mean annual soil temperature is 46 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 63 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR."

The soils formed in polylithologic alluvial sediments derived from mixed sources and characterized by a moderately coarse textured upper part of the control section and a coarse textured lower part.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches, with maximum periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and early summer."
