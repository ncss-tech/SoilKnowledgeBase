  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 38 to 91 cm. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm. The mineral solum is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. The substratum is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand except some pedons have gravelly or very gravelly strata below depths of 100 cm. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume above a depth of 100 cm, including thin strata of fine gravel in some pedons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the mineral material unless limed.\nCultivated areas have an Ap horizon 13 to 25 cm thick with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe O horizons, where present, have a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR with value and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have a Bh horizon with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 6. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Consistence is very friable or friable. Concretions are not present in some pedons.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color, texture, and consistence like the BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Consistence is loose or very friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Allagash soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Steep slopes are on terrace margin escarpments and sides of gullies in dissected outwash plains. The soils formed in materials derived mainly from granite, slate, schist, gneiss, phyllite and quartzite. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 84 to 1219  mm, and mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 6 to 610 m above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adams, Colton, Fryeburg, Machias, Madawaska, Masardis, Ondawa, Salmon, and Stetson soils. Adams, Colton, Masardis, Salmon, and Stetson soils are on adjacent outwash terraces and plains and glacial lake plains. Fryeburg and Ondawa soils are on nearby floodplains. Adams and Colton soils have a thinner loamy mantle and Masardis and Stetson soils have more gravel in the substratum. Machias and Madawaska soils are moderately well drained and are in lower positions on the landscape. Salmon soils are not underlain by sands and gravels."

Spodic horizon - the zone from 5 to 20 cm (Bhs and Bs1 horizons).\n3. Strongly contrasting particle-size class - the transition at 71 cm between the loamy material and the sandy material in the control section (25 to 100 cm) is less than 13 cm. The loamy material has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in haracteristics is Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin 46, 1971.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
