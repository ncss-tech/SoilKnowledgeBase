  "OVERVIEW": "The Ayrmount series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy sediments and the underlying glacial till on moraines.  Permeability is rapid in the upper part of the subsoil and moderate in the lower part and in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.  Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less is 24 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 3 percent in the upper two parts of the control section and from 2 to 10 percent in the lower two parts.\nThe upper part of the series control section (A) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Clay content is from 4 to 8 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral depending on liming history.\nThe second part of the series control section (Bw, Bt) is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Clay content is from 2 to 10 percent and sand content is from 75 to 95 percent.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR; value is 4 or 5; and chroma is 4 or 6.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe third part of the series control section (2Bt) is sandy clay loam in the upper part, and loam in the lower part.  Clay content averages 15 to 27 percent, and sand content averages 35 to 65 percent.  Hue is 10YR; value is 4 or 5; and chroma is 3 to 6.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section (2C) has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.   Clay content is from 10 to 18 percent and sand content is from 35 to 52 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Free carbonates are present, and calcium carbonate equivalent is 20 to 30 percent."
