  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sola are typically 15 to 25 inches thick but range from 8 to 35 inches in thickness.  Fragments of weathered chalk are commonly throughout the profile.  The soil is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam throughout.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from about 15 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly contains thin sandy or clayey strata.  In some pedons these soils have common fine faint brownish mottles at depths greater than 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Angelus series is the only series in this family.  Competing series in other families are Bridgeport, Caruso, Clairemont, McCook, Munjor, and Roxbury series.  Bridgeport, Caruso, McCook, and Roxbury soils have mollic epipedons.  In addition, Caruso soils are fine-loamy, and McCook soils are coarse-silty.  Clairemont soils are thermic.  Munjor soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Angelus soils are on low alluvial terraces and flood plains.  Slope gradients average less than 1 percent.  The soil is formed in alluvium derived mainly from chalky shale and soft limestone of the Niobrara formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature at the type location is about 53 degrees F.  Thornthwaite's Annual P-E Index ranges from 24 to 40."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bridgeport, Caruso, and Munjor soils.  The sandy textured Inavale soils are on flood plains, and the Elkader, Manvel and Minnequa soils are on adjacent uplands.  Elkader soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Manvel and Minnequa soils are drier."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils receive extra water as runoff from adjacent upland.  Some areas are subject to occasional flooding for short periods.  A water table is usually between depths of 10 and 20 feet."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
