  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 2002 to allow a Bt horizon to occur in some pedons above the glossic horizon. The series was updated in 2004 to add fine sandy loam texture to the range in characteristics for the A and E horizons, allow value 5 in the range in characteristics for the E horizon, allow none to few quartzite pebbles in the epipedon in some pedons, allow clay loam texture in the Glossic horizon, allow the Bt/E horizon to range up to slightly acid, and allow the Btg/E horizon to range down to very strongly acid.\nThis soil was formerly included in the Caddo or Thage series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon ---- 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in).   (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon---- 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in).  (Bt/E horizons)\nGlossic horizon ---- 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in).   (Bt/E horizons)\nAquic conditions --- 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in).   (Bt/E1 horizon).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
