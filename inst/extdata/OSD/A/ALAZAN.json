  "OVERVIEW": "The Alazan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial or marine sediments. These nearly level soils are on Pleistocene terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation range is about 1016 to 1397 mm (40 to 55 in) and the mean annual soil temperature is about 19 to 21 degrees C (67 to 70 degrees F).",

The series was updated in 2004 to add fine sandy loam texture to the range in characteristics for the A and E horizons, allow value 5 in the range in characteristics for the E horizon, allow none to few quartzite pebbles in the epipedon in some pedons, allow clay loam texture in the Glossic horizon, allow the Bt/E horizon to range up to slightly acid, and allow the Btg/E horizon to range down to very strongly acid.\nThis soil was formerly included in the Caddo or Thage series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon ---- 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in).   (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon---- 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in).  (Bt/E horizons)\nGlossic horizon ---- 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in).   (Bt/E horizons)\nAquic conditions --- 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in).   (Bt/E1 horizon).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
