The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from April 15 to November 30.  Summer thunderstorms occur, but are spotty and usually do not wet the moisture control section; aridic (or torric) moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nSoil temperature: 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C.\nDepth to the stratified lacustrine deposits: 50 to 100 cm.\nVolcanic glass content: 60 to 80 percent in the A horizon and upper C horizons and 30 to 50 percent in the lower C horizon formed in lake sediments; Sands are glassy shards of rhyolitic volcanic ash\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.\nOther features: The soil surface is covered with 5 to 10 percent pumice gravel.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 1 to 5 percent in the upper part of the profile and 1 to 20 percent in the lower part.\nA horizon\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nRock fragments: 5 to 10 percent fine pumice gravel.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nC horizon\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Ashy sand or ashy loamy sand.\nRock fragments: 0 to 5 percent fine pumice gravel.\nEffervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSalinity (EC): 0 to 8 mmhos/cm.\nSodicity (SAR): 0 to 13.\n2Bqn and 2Cn horizons\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.\nChroma: 1 or 2, dry or moist.\nTexture: Stratified ashy silt loam, ashy loam, ashy sandy loam, or ashy sand. Typically the strata ranges from 2 to 18 cm thick but some may be as thick as 38 cm. Gravelly substratum soils are recognized with textures of stratified very gravelly ashy loamy sand through gravelly ashy sand.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSalinity (EC): 8 to 16 mmhos/cm.\nSodicity (SAR): 13 to 30.\nOther features: Thin 3 to 6 mm thick discontinuous silica-cemented zones are present in some pedons; Masses of iron accumulation with high chroma, which are relict redoximorphic features, are present in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alamedawell soils are on lake terraces with hummocky microrelief.  Dunes are associated with these soils in most areas. They formed in rhyolitic volcanic ash that was deposited by wind over finer-textured lacustrine sediments. The ash has since been reworked by wind and water. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,170 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, much of it as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 10 degrees C, the mean January temperature is about 2.2 degrees C, and the mean July temperature is about 18.9 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
