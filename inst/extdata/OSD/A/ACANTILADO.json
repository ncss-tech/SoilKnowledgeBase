Alicia soils have a soil moisture control section that is dry for longer periods of time and do not have argillic horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section: 0 to 62 inches (0 to 158 cm).\nParticle-size control section: 15 to 35 inches (38 to 88 cm).  (Btk1 and part of the Btk2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 4 inches (0 to 10 cm).  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 4 to 15 inches (10 to 38 cm).  (Bw horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 15 to 62 inches (38 to158 cm).  (Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 and Btk4 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 15 to 62 inches (38 to158 cm).  (Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 and Btk4 horizons)\nRemarks: 2/2004 WAW Added clay loam texture for Btk, corrected spelling of Kucu competing series.\n10/2007 WAW Added metric units, edited parent materials and landform terminology.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Pedon Number 03N0750 is from the type location.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
