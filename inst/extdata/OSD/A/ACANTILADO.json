  "OVERVIEW": "The Acantilado series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from red sandstone and shale.  Acantilado soils are on fans remnants and plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches (38 cm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).",

(Btk1 and part of the Btk2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 4 inches (0 to 10 cm).  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 4 to 15 inches (10 to 38 cm).  (Bw horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 15 to 62 inches (38 to158 cm).  (Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 and Btk4 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 15 to 62 inches (38 to158 cm).  (Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 and Btk4 horizons)\nRemarks: 2/2004 WAW Added clay loam texture for Btk, corrected spelling of Kucu competing series.\n10/2007 WAW Added metric units, edited parent materials and landform terminology.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Pedon Number 03N0750 is from the type location.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
