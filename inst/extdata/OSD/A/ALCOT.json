  "OVERVIEW": "The Alcot series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in deep ash-flow deposits.  They are on plateaus and hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The  particle-size control section contains more than 60 percent volcanic ash and pumice, of which 35 percent or more is pumice.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand with para fragments consisting of rounded pumice ranging from 15 to 35 percent paragravel and 20 to 35 percent paracobbles.
