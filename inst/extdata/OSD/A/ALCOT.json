The  particle-size control section contains more than 60 percent volcanic ash and pumice, of which 35 percent or more is pumice.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and 2 through 4 dry.

Slopes are 1 to 35 percent. The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 55 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
