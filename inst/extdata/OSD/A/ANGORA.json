  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Competing series in other families are the Bridget, Creighton, Gates, Keota, Mitchell, and Oglala series. Bridget soils have a mollic epipedon and do not have a cambic horizon. Creighton soils are coarse-loamy, have a mollic epipedon and a thicker solum. Gates soils occur in a moister climate, contain less than 0.3 percent organic carbon content and do not have a cambic horizon. Keota soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, are calcareous throughout and do not have a cambic horizon. Mitchell soils are calcareous throughout and do not have a cambic horizon. Oglala soils typically do not have a B horizon, have carbonates at a lower depth, and have soft bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in very fine sandy loam calcareous loess. The range of mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The range of mean annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F."

Busher soils are coarse-loamy, have a mollic epipedon, a thicker solum and are on similar landscapes and on side slopes at lower parts of the landscape. Canyon soils are shallow to soft bedrock and are on lower parts of the landscape. Tassel soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 10 to 20 inches, are calcareous throughout and are on side slopes at lower parts of the landscape."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The fine sand and coarser separate (diameter between 0.1 mm and 2.0 mm) totals about 15 percent. The particle-size class of coarse-silty is provisional. Where this soil is in native grass, the diagnostic horizons are evident. Where cultivated, the plow layer generally includes both the surface layer and most of the subsoil and the genetic horizons are not so easy to discern.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (A horizon); cambic horizon--the zone from 13 to 41 centimeters (5 to 16 inches) (Bw and BC horizons).\nAngora soils were previously included in the Jayem, Creighton, and Oglala series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: One pedon is in the KSSL database; Lab pedon id 78NE123005.\n11/2020 Changed Taxonomic Class from obsolete Coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Aridic Ustochrepts to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustepts per Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014. Cation-Exchange Activity Class was added based on KSSL pedon data (lab pedon id 78NE123005).\n11/2020 Added diagnostic horizons and features to OSD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
