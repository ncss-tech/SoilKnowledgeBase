  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Abarca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy-skeletal alluvium over sand and gravel derived from mixed sources.  Abarca soils are on terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk and 2CBk horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2CBk horizon.\nThe presence of secondary calcium carbonate from 9 to 60 inches.  (Bk and 2CBk horizons)\nA paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Loamy-skeletal, mixed Torriorthentic Haploborolls to Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Torriorthentic Haplustolls.  Format and horizonation designations were updated. The series has not been updated by the state since 1972.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
