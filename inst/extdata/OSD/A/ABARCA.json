(2 to 8 inches thick).\nA2--4 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to coarse granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly plastic, slightly sticky; 25 percent gravel; calcareous; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0 (cresol red); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick).\nBk--9 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly plastic, slightly sticky; 45 percent gravel; visible secondary carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; calcareous; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0 (cresol red); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 33 inches thick).\n2CBk--30 to 60 inches; very gravelly sand.  Gravel fragments are lime coated in the upper part with the amount of lime decreasing with depth."

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by peak periods of precipitation that occur in the spring and early summer.  Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature:  about 43 degrees F\nMean summer soil temperature:  about 60 degrees F\nDepth to secondary calcium carbonate:  7 to 40 inches\nDepth to lithologic discontinuity:  20 to 40 inches\nThickness of the mollic epipedon:  7 to 15 inches\nParticle-size control section (weighted average):\nClay content:  18 to 35 percent in the upper part and less than 10 percent in the lower part\nSand content:  20 to 50 percent in the upper part and greater than 80 percent in the lower part\nRock fragments:  35 to 85 percent gravel and cobble\nA horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR to 5Y?\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma:  1 to 3 dry or moist\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 14 percent\nESP: 0 to 15 percent\nReaction:  slightly to strongly alkaline\nBk horizon:\nTexture:  gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam\nClay content:  18 to 35 percent\nRock fragments:  15 to 60 percent gravel and cobble\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 14 percent\nESP: 0 to 15 percent\n2CBk horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR to 5Y?\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 14 percent\nESP: 0 to 15 percent\nReaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline\nCOMPETING SERIES:  Currently there are no other series in this family. Similar and related series include the Shrine series which differs in having less than 35 percent coarse fragments.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nParent material: loamy-skeletal alluvium over sand and gravel derived from mixed sources\nLandform: nearly level to steep terraces and alluvial fans\nSlopes:  0 to 30 percent\nElevation: 6,700 to 7.200 feet\nMean annual precipitation: at the type location it is about 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months\nMean annual air temperature: about 39 degrees F.\nMean summer air temperature: about 59 degrees F.\nFrost-free period: 70 to 90 days\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Evanston and Mergel series.  The Evanston series differs in having an argillic horizon and in lacking coarse textured IIC horizons.  The Mergel series differs in lacking coarse textured IIC horizons above 40 inches.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to slow. Permeability is moderate.\nUSE AND VEGETATION:  They are used principally as native pastureland or irrigated cropland.  Native vegetation includes big sage, Sandberg bluegrass, cactus.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution limited southern and western Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana\nSERIES PROPOSED:  Uinta County, Wyoming 1972.  Series name is a coined name.\nREMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk and 2CBk horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2CBk horizon.\nThe presence of secondary calcium carbonate from 9 to 60 inches.  (Bk and 2CBk horizons)\nA paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Loamy-skeletal, mixed Torriorthentic Haploborolls to Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Torriorthentic Haplustolls.  Format and horizonation designations were updated. The series has not been updated by the state since 1972.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
