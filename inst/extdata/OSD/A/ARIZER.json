The Arizer series was formerly included in the Acuff series.\nClassification changed from Calcic Paleargids to Ustic Calciargids based on lab data showing total clay decreasing by more than 20 percent from the maximum within 150 cm (59 in) of the mineral soil surface. The epipedon meets all requirements for a mollic horizon except that the epipedon is moist for less than 90 cumulative days in normal years.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) A horizon Bt1 horizons.\nArgillic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (5 to 80 in) Bt, Btkk, and Btk horizons.\nCalcic horizon: 57 to 203 cm (22 to 80 in) Btkk and Btk horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Laboratory Data available - Roosevelt County, New Mexico (S10NM041004).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
