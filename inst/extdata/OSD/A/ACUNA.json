    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The depth to distinct accumulations of calcium carbonate is about 16 to 40 inches with 5 to 30 percent visible secondary forms.  Total calcium carbonate content in the 10 to 40 inch control section is about 40 to 55 percent.  Depth to\nlimestone or gravel ranges from 6 to 20 feet.  Limestone fragments\nof pebble size range from 0 to 15 percent.  COLE ranges from 0.03\nto 0.05.  Total clay of the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges\nfrom 35 to 50 percent and silicate clay ranges from 20 to 35\npercent.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown,\ngrayish brown, dark brown, or brown in hue 10YR, chromas of 2\nthrough 3 and values of 3 through 5.  Moist values and chromas are less than 3.5.  Texture of the A horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe B21t horizon is brown, light brown, or pale brown in hues of\n10YR and 7.5Y, chromas of 3 through 4, and values of 5 through 6.\nIt is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Structure ranges from weak to moderate subangular blocky.\nThe B2ca horizons are brown, light brown, pale brown, very pale brown, light yellowish brown, or pink in hues of 10YR and 7.5YR, chromas of 3 through 4 and values of 5 through 8.  It is silty\nclay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Some pedons have Cca horizons\nbelow 40 inches with colors the same as the B2ca horizons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no soils in the same family.  Similar soils are the Angelo, Castroville, Dant, Elindio, Knippa,\nLewisville, Nuvalde, and Uvalde series.  All of these soils have\nless than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Angelo and Knippa soils crack when dry and have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Castroville, Lewisville, and Nuvalde soils are most in the control section for longer periods of time.  Dant soils lack a calcic\nhorizon within a depth of 40 inches and have a fine-loamy control section."

Slope\ngradients range from 0 to 3 percent but are mainly less than 1 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium high in calcium carbonate\nfrom limestone areas.  The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 21 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 69 degrees to 73 degrees F.  The\nThornthwaite P-E indices are 25 to 34."

Mavco and Valverde soils have ochric epipedons and in addition, Valverde soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

As\nretrogression occurs red grama, perennial threeawn, fall\nwitchgrass, and Hall's panicum increase along with woody shrubs.\nAs deterioration continues a large percent of the plants consists\nof woody shrubs such as mesquite, whitebrush, agarita, yuccas, and cacti with an understory of red grama, hairy tridens, and\nperennial treeawn.  Some areas are irrigated and seeded to\nimproved forage grasses.  Oats are grown for forage in some areas."
