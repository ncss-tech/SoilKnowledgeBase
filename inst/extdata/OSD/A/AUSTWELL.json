  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Austwell series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in saline, calcareous, alluvial sediments high in smectitic clays .  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains on low coastal plains.  Slopes are less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
