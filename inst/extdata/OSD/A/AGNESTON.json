  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 41 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Thin A horizons are present in some pedons.  Base saturation is less than 60 percent in at least some subhorizon of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  Transitional E/B horizons are absent in most pedons or are less than 3 inches in thickness.  Rock fragments range from 1/8 to 10 inches in the B horizons and are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter and range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  Within the sand fraction the content of medium and coarser angular sand having a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains ranges from 15 to about 90 percent and horizions of low organic matter content have a differential between dry and moist consistence that is 1 to 3 times greater than soils of similar texture having finer and more rounded sand grains.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period of nearly every year.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from neutral to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically gravelly or very gravelly or very cobbly sandy clay loam, and less typically a clay loam.  It averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 0 to 30 percent silt, and 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is moderately to very strongly acid.\nThe BC or C horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid."

Angostura, Cundiyo, Duchesne, Frisco, Granile, Hollandlake, Larand, Leadville, MacFarlane, (T)Needleton, Presa, Tigeron, Tolvar, and Worock soils lack a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches. Hyattville, Lakehelen, and (T)Tenrag soils all have hues that are predominantly 5YR or redder in a majority of subhorizons.  Cloud Peak soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and C horizon and have consistent k horizons.  Gambler, Lake Creek, and Lulude soils have more than 60 percent base saturation in all parts of the argillic horizon.  Kebler soils have rock fragments that are dominantly more than 10 inches in diameter and have transitional A&B horizons.  Guffey and (T)Tamarron soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Agneston soils are on hills, plateaus, ridges, and mountainsides.  Slopes range from about 2 to 50 percent.  The soil formed in moderately thin, gravelly to very gravelly coarse textured, noncalcareous materials weathered from granite.  Elevation ranges from 8,200 to 11,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and ranges from 20 to 30 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 38 degrees F."
