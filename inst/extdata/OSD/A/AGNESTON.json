  "OVERVIEW": "The Agneston series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in moderately thin gravelly to very gravelly coarse textured, noncalcareous materials weathered from granite.  Agneston soils are on hills, plateaus, ridges, and mountainsides.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 5 degrees C, and mean summer soil temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Thin A horizons are present in some pedons.  Base saturation is less than 60 percent in at least some subhorizon of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 50 to 100 cm. Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 60 cm and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 43 to 100 cm.  Transitional E/B horizons are absent in most pedons or are less than 8 cm in thickness.  Rock fragments range from 25 to 250 mm in the B horizons and are mostly less than 75 mm in diameter and range from 25 to 250 mm in diameter.  Within the sand fraction the content of medium and coarser angular sand having a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains ranges from 15 to about 90 percent and horizons of low organic matter content have a differential between dry and moist consistence that is 1 to 3 times greater than soils of similar texture having finer and more rounded sand grains.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period of nearly every year.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from neutral to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically gravelly or very gravelly or very cobbly sandy clay loam, and less typically a clay loam.  It averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 0 to 30 percent silt, and 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is moderately to very strongly acid.\nThe BC or C horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid."

Angostura, Cundiyo, Duchesne, Frisco, Granile, Hollandlake, Larand, Leadville, MacFarlane, (T)Needleton, Presa, Tigeron, Tolvar, and Worock soils lack a lithic contact above a depth of 100 cm. Hyattville, Lakehelen, and (T)Tenrag soils all have hues that are predominantly 5YR or redder in a majority of subhorizons.  Cloud Peak soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and C horizon and have consistent k horizons.  Gambler, Lake Creek, and Lulude soils have more than 60 percent base saturation in all parts of the argillic horizon.  Kebler soils have rock fragments that are dominantly more than 250 mm in diameter and have transitional A&B horizons.  Guffey and (T)Tamarron soils have a paralithic contact above 100 cm."
