  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand throughout.  The A1 horizon includes mucky sand or mucky loamy fine sand in many pedons.  Soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3.  In some pedons, the lower subhorizons have few to common small pockets or few discontinuous horizontal streaks less than 1/2 inch thick of grayish or brownish sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral, value of 4 to 6.  Mottles in colors of gray, yellow, or brown occur in many pedons.  Some pedons have an AC horizon as much as 12 inches thick that have mixed colors of the A horizon and the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Closely similar soils are the Anclote and Sellers series.  Anclote soils have a mollic epipedon 10 to 24 inches thick.  Sellers soils have an umbric epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Astor soils are on nearly level, low areas, poorly defined drainageways, and flood plains in the Lower Coastal Plain in Peninsular Florida.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation near the type location is about 52 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the closely similar Anclote series and the Delray, Gator, Manatee, Myakka, Riviera, and Terra Ceia series.  Delray, Manatee, and Riviera soils have argillic horizons.  Gator and Terra Ceia soils are organic.  Myakka soils lack a mollic epipedon, have E horizons, and a spodic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Astor soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow.  Permeability is rapid.  They are saturated and frequently covered with shallow water during the summer rainy season.  During drier seasons, the water table may recede to depths of 30 inches or more."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Astor soils are used mainly for range and forest.  A few cleared areas with established water control practices are used for truck crops and improved pasture.  Natural vegetation in swamps consists of sweetgum, red maple, water oak, laurel oak, and a few slash pine or loblolly pine with an understory of waxmyrtle, inkberry, cabbage palm, greenbrier, and poison-ivy; in sloughs or marshes, and sand cordgrass and grasswort predominate."
