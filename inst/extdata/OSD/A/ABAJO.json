These soils formed in alluvium mainly from intrusive igneous rocks, such as diorite, andesite, dacite and trachyte porphyries, but in some areas from sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid. The average annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 46 degrees to 48 degrees F. and the frost-free period is about 130 to 140 days."
