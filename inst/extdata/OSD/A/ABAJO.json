  "OVERVIEW": "The Abajo series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from intrusive igneous rocks, such as diorite, andesite, dacite and trachyte porphyries, but in some areas from sandstone.  Abajo soils are on old stream terraces and fans.  Slope is 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
