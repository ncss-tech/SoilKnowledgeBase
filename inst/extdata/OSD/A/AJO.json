  "OVERVIEW": "The Ajo series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium.  Ajo soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.",

These soils formed in stratified fan alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 4 to 10 inches, about half of which falls as summer thunderstorms during the months of July, August and September.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 67 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 350 days."
