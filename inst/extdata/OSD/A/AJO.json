These soils formed in stratified fan alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 4 to 10 inches, about half of which falls as summer thunderstorms during the months of July, August and September.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 67 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 350 days."
