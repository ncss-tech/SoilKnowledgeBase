  "OVERVIEW": "The Alabaster series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils formed clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
