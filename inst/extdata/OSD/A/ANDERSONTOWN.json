  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic soil layers ranges from 16 to 50 inches.  The organic materials are comprised of herbaceous materials and leaves with very small amounts of woody materials, very thin mineral layers occasionally occur in the organic layers.  Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid in the organic layers and the mineral substrata ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.  Diatom frustules and fresh water sponge spicules are abundant.\nThe Oi layer has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky.  Excluding surface leaf litter it is comprised of fibric material with an unrubbed fiber content that ranges from 66 to 80 percent of the organic volume; rubbed fiber content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe Oe layer, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Structure is moderate or strong, medium, granular or sub- angular blocky.  The unrubbed fiber content is 30 to 60 percent of the organic volume; rubbed fiber content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.\nThe Oa layer has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Structure is weak, moderate or strong, fine medium or coarse granular or subangular blocky, or is massive.  The unrubbed fiber content ranges from 5 to 30 percent of the organic volume; rubbed fiber content is less than 5 percent.\nThe unconforming mineral substrata has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The substrata is commonly stratified sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam and silty clay loam.  Thin layers of gravelly loamy sand are in some pedons."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 58 degrees F., and precipitation ranges from 42 to 48 inches."
