    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family.  Elbert, Iredell, and Orange soils are similar series in related families.  All of the soils in related families have an ochric epipedon.   In addition, Elbert soils are mesic, Iredell soils do not have low chroma mottles in the upper part of the Bt horizon, and Orange soils have yellowish brown or strong brown Bt horizons with low chroma mottles in the upper 10 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Armenia soils are on small to medium flood plains or upland flats and depressions of the Piedmont Plateau. The soils formed in material mostly weathered from dark colored basic rocks. This soil commonly is overlain by a thin, 10- to 20-inch, layer of loamy alluvium.  Near the type location, the average annual precipitation is about 46 inches, the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, and the freeze-free season is about 202 days."

Chewacla and Wehadkee soils have less than 35 percent clay.  Cecil soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Enon, Mecklenburg, and Winnsboro soils are well drained and have mixed mineralogy.  Wilkes soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact within 20 inches of the surface."
