  "OVERVIEW": "The Armenia series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey material mostly weathered from dark colored, basic rocks.  It is commonly overlain by a thin, 10 to 20 inch, layer of loamy alluvium.  These soils are on small to medium flood plains or nearly level upland flats and depressions of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes commonly are less than 1 percent but range to as much as 2 percent.  Near the type location the average annual precipitation is about 46 inches and the average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

The content of clay of the Armenia series typically increases by more than 20 percent (absolute) within 3 inches which is within the definition of Abruptic Argiaquolls but lacks the drying of the subsoil characteristics.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 29 inches (Ap1, Ap2, BA1, BA2, and Btg horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 20 to 48 inches (Btg and Btgc horizons)\nMLRA = 136\nSIR = SC0087"
