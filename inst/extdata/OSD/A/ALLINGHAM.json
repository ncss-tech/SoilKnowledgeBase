    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\numbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 16 inches (A1, A2, A3 horizons), has base saturation by ammonium acetate of 42, 43 and 53 percent respectively.\ncambic horizon - the zone from approximately 17 to 29 inches (2Bwb horizon).\nargillic horizon - the zone from 29 to 66 inches (3Btb1 and 3Btb2 horizons).\nAndic soil properties - the zone from 1 to 66 inches; the upper 17 inches of the profile contain about 62 percent glass in the very fine sand fraction, phosphate retention of 79 to 82 percent, acid oxalate aluminum of 1.4 percent, acid oxalate iron of 1.7 percent.\nVitri - The 15-bar water content on dry samples is 9 percent and on undried samples is 10 percent for the zone from 0 to 16 inches.\nParticle size control section - (1 to 41 inches); The zone from 1 to 29 inches has acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 1 percent or more and the 15-bar water content on dried samples is 8 to 11 percent and on undried samples is 9 to 14 percent.  The zone from 29 to 41 inches has acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 1 percent or more and the 15-bar water content on dried samples is 16 percent and on undried samples 20 to 30 percent.\nThe A1, A2, A3 and 2Bwb horizons are weathered in \"Blue Lake\" and \"Sand Mountain\" tephra which is approximately (3,440 years old).  The 3Btb horizon material is weathered in \"Jack Creek\" glacial outwash which is approximately (75,000 years old).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial and complete laboratory data are available for this pedon.  Reference samples S84OR-620-001 and S87OR-031-003 from Jefferson County, Oregon, NSSL, Lincoln, NE.  The glass counts from the 1984 samples are used for classification.  There is a major discrepancy in glass count between the 1984 and 1987 samples; samples are from the same pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
