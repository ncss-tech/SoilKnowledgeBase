  "OVERVIEW": "The Appanoose series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on nearly level interfluves on dissected till plains and treads on high loess-covered stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 955 millimeters.",
