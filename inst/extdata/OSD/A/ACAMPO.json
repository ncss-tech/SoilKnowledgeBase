  "OVERVIEW": "The Acampo series consists of deep to hardpan, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock sources.  Acampo soils are on low fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
