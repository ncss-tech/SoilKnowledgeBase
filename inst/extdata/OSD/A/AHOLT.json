Free carbonates are throughout the control section and reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 or 3, 3 through 5 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2; the darker colors are in the upper part.  Some pedons are mottled gray and brown in the lower part.  It is clay or silty clay and the control section averages more than 60 percent clay.  Distinct or prominent brown and gray mottles occur throughout the soil below the Ap horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 0 or 2.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam and may include thin strata of coarser textures."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bosworth, Kolls, and Ryepatch series in the same family and the Booker, Carlow, Darwin, Wabash, and Waldron series.  Bosworth soils are stratified with thin coarser strata and also lack secondary calcium carbonate concretions.  Kolls and Ryepatch soils are in areas of lower rainfall.  Booker soils lack free carbonates.  Carlow, Darwin, and Wabash soils contain less clay and lack free carbonates.  Waldron soils contain less clay and generally are stratified below the surface layer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aholt soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional low benches and first bottom lands along major rivers and on high benches and glacial lake plains.  The slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in thick clayey calcareous alluvium or clayey lacustrine sediments.  The mean annual temperature varies from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 32 to 42 inches."
