  "STATES": "IL,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Aholt series consists of very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick clayey calcareous alluvium or clayey lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional low benches and first bottom lands along major rivers and their tributaries and on high benches and glacial lake plains.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2; the darker colors are in the upper part.  Some pedons are mottled gray and brown in the lower part.  It is clay or silty clay and the control section averages more than 60 percent clay.  Distinct or prominent brown and gray mottles occur throughout the soil below the Ap horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 0 or 2.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam and may include thin strata of coarser textures."

Bosworth soils are stratified with thin coarser strata and also lack secondary calcium carbonate concretions.  Kolls and Ryepatch soils are in areas of lower rainfall.  Booker soils lack free carbonates.  Carlow, Darwin, and Wabash soils contain less clay and lack free carbonates.  Waldron soils contain less clay and generally are stratified below the surface layer."
