The soil between 8 to 24 inches is moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1 and dry in all parts from July 1 to November 1.  Depth to basalt bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Cracks 1 to 2 cm wide are at a depth of 20 inches; these cracks are 2 to 5 cm wide at the surface.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Cobbles and stones range from 20 to 35 percent in the profile.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.   The surface is covered with 0 to 35 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent stones.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/4; 10YR 4/1 or 4/2.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6; 10YR 3/2 or 4/2.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe C horizon is 5YR 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6.

Alo, Altamont, Auld, Ayar and Sehorn soils have less than 20 percent coarse fragments.  Asbill and Chinapoint soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches.  Cibo soils have lithic contact within 40 inches.  Galt and Hollenbeck soils have a duripan.  Lostpoint soils are saline-alkali.  Capay, Centerville, Porterville and Seville soils lack a lithic contact.  Lecrag soils are mesic."

These soils formed in material weathered from basalt of the Quien Sabe Formation.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 22 inches.  The mean January temperature is 45 degrees F, mean July temperature is 77 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped as Rough Stony Land in the Los Banos Area, Series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated by having deep soil and grass cover.  pH determined by colormetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Organic matter estimated by comparing with adjacent soils determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HCl.\nSeries reclassified June 1996.  Competing series not reviewed at that time.  Noted lack of slickensides and/or wedge-shaped aggregates in profile.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
