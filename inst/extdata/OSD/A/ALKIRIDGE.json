Vanson soils are deep.  The Crinker, Hatchet,\nHowson, Klawatti, Polallie, and Springsteen soils are 20\nto 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Esmeralda, Gilpar,\nJackman, Kachess, Lemah, Playco, and Thetis soils\nare more than 40 inches deep.  Kindy soils lack the ashy\nsurface mantle and are silt loam or loam in the spodic\nhorizon.  Ohana soils have 35 to 45 percent cinders in the\nupper part of the spodic horizon and have a\nparalithic contact with weathered tuff breccia.  Vabus and\nWaptus soils have a spodic horizon less than 7\ninches thick and are sandy loam in the fine earth fraction\nbelow the spodic horizon."
