  "OVERVIEW": "The Alkiridge series consists of moderately deep, moderately\nwell drained soils formed in volcanic ash and\npumice over colluvium and glacial till overlying dense\nalpine glacial till.  Alkiridge soils are in cirque\nbasins and valley floors, at elevations of 2,700 to 3,700\nfeet.  Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent.  Average\nannual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Mean annual air\ntemperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Esmeralda, Gilpar,\nJackman, Kachess, Lemah, Playco, and Thetis soils\nare more than 40 inches deep.  Kindy soils lack the ashy\nsurface mantle and are silt loam or loam in the spodic\nhorizon.  Ohana soils have 35 to 45 percent cinders in the\nupper part of the spodic horizon and have a\nparalithic contact with weathered tuff breccia.  Vabus and\nWaptus soils have a spodic horizon less than 7\ninches thick and are sandy loam in the fine earth fraction\nbelow the spodic horizon."
