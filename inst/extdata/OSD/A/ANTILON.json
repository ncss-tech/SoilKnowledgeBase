  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Estimated mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches depth is 50 degrees to 55 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches. The upper part of the control section is dominated by volcanic pumice, 35 to 75 percent by volume, with lesser amounts of volcanic ash; and contains 60 to 90 percent pyroclastic materials. The lower part of the control section is silty clay loam modified by 10 to 35 percent nonpumice coarse fragments. The mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick. The soils are mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Depth to the lithologic discontinuity and secondary carbonate is 16 to 38 inches.\nThe A (or Ap) horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It has weak blocky, platy or prismatic structure.\nThe BA horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam with pumice gravel. It is massive or has weak blocky or granular structure.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7\ndry, and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam with pumice gravel.\nThe 2Btkb horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. It is silty clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam and has moderate to strong structure."

These soils formed in pumice and ash mixed with some loess over lacustrine sediments. The climate is semiarid; summers are hot and dry an winters are cold and moist. Average annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. Mean January temperature is 25 degrees F., average July temperature is 72 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and average frost-free season is 185 to 200 days."
