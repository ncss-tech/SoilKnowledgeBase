Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 4 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 686 mm. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 305 to 490 meters above seal level."

The very poorly drained Dora and Daisybay soils formed in organic material over clayey sediments and are in lower lying concave positions. The poorly drained Indus soils are closely associated and are on plane to slightly concave slopes. The moderately well drained Taylor soils are on more convex slopes and higher lying positions. The very poorly drained Woodslake soils are in lower lying concave positions."
