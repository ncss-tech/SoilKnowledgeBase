  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Abrazo series consists of moderately deep, well drained slowly permeable soils that formed in material derived from igneous rocks such as rhyolite and andesite and tuffs.  Abrazo soils are on hills, mountainsides, and plains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
