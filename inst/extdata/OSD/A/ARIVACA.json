  "OVERVIEW": "The Arivaca series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed on relict fan terraces from alluvium derived from basalt, conglomerate, and tuff.  Slope is 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

Complete update should include a re-visit of the site and subsequent separate re-description of the petrocalcic horizon.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
