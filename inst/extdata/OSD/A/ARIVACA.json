Elevation ranges from 3400 to 5500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 59 to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."

Complete update should include a re-visit of the site and subsequent separate re-description of the petrocalcic horizon.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
