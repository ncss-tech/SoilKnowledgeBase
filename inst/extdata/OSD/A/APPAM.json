  "OVERVIEW": "The Appam series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the substratum.  These soils are on outwash plains and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",

Depth to carbonates ranges from 12 to more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Lihen, Schaller, Telfer and Wabek soils do not have cambic horizons.  Manning soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Ruso and Tally soils are coarse-loamy.  In addition, Ruso and Manning soils have sand and gravel at depths of 24 to 40 inches."

Slope gradients typically are less than 5 percent but range to 15 percent.  These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 16 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

All of these soils are on nearby terraces, commonly at different levels.  Bowdle, Divide and Lehr soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Korchea soils are fine-loamy and have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth."
