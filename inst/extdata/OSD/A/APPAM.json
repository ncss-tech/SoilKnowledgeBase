Depth to carbonates ranges from 12 to more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Other series are the Lihen, Manning, Ruso, Schaller, Tally, Telfer and Wabek soils.  Lihen, Schaller, Telfer and Wabek soils do not have cambic horizons.  Manning soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Ruso and Tally soils are coarse-loamy.  In addition, Ruso and Manning soils have sand and gravel at depths of 24 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Appam soils are on smooth and plane, level to strongly sloping outwash plains and terraces.  Slope gradients typically are less than 5 percent but range to 15 percent.  These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 16 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lihen, Schaller, Telfer and Wabek soils and the Bowdle, Divide, Korchea and Lehr soils.  All of these soils are on nearby terraces, commonly at different levels.  Bowdle, Divide and Lehr soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Korchea soils are fine-loamy and have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth."
