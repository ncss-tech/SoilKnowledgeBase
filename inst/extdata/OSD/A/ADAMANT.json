  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "VT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Adamant series consists of well drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits on eroded, glacial lake plains and terraces.  They are moderately deep to schist or phyllite bedrock.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid.  Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are pebbles or channers and range from 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid throoughout the soils.  Some pedons have A or Ap horizons that range to extremeley acid.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of fine sandy loam in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. The A horizon is 0 to 5 inches thick and the Ap horizon is 5 to 10 inches thick.\nSome pedons have an Oe horizon.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nSome pedons have a Bhs or Bh horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Combined thickness of the B horizon is 8 to 20 inches.\nSome pedons have a  BC horizon that has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is up to 5 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nBedrock is slightly weathered schist."

Adamant soils were previously mapped and correlated as Salmon Variant (moderately deep variant) in Lamoille County, Vermont.\n3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Albic horizon - the zone from 4 to 9 inches (E horizon).\nb.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 9 to 14 inches (Bs1 horizon).\nc.  Lithic contact - bedrock at 28 inches from the soil surface."
