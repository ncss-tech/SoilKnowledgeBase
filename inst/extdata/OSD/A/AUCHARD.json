  "OVERVIEW": "The Auchard series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from semiconsolidated shale, siltstone, and mudstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
