    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperatures range from 42 to 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperatures range from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 38 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick and often includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The texture control section has 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly has cobbly or very cobbly modifiers.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It commonly is very cobbly clay loam but the fine earth fraction may include clay or sandy clay textures.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The soil formed in colluvium and residuum from breccia or tuff.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 100 days."

Posant soil is less than 20 inches to bedrock and occurs on ridges or steeper slopes than Alamaditas soil.  Tolman soils are shallow to bedrock and have a loamy-skeletal argillic horion."
