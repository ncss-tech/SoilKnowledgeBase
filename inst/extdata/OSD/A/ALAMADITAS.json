  "OVERVIEW": "The Alamaditas series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soil on mountain back slopes and toe slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from breccia and tuff.  Slopes range from 15 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

It commonly has cobbly or very cobbly modifiers.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It commonly is very cobbly clay loam but the fine earth fraction may include clay or sandy clay textures.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
