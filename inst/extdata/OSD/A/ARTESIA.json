    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Artesia series are on gently to moderately sloping fan terraces at elevations of 2200 to 5200 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 5 percent but range to 8 percent.  These soils formed in fan alluvium from basic igneous rocks, dominantly basalt and tuff.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 190 to 280 days.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches, occurring mainly as thundershowers in the summer and as gentle rains in winter."
