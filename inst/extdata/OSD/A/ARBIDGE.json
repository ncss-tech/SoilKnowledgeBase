Dacker soils have SIL or SICL Bt horizons.  Deerlodge soils have 7.5YR hue in the B2t horizons and have up to 35 percent gravel in the argillic horizon. Ditchcamp soils are slightly acid or neutral throughout and are noncalcareous throughout the profile.  Exel soils have 5YR or 7.5YR hues in the argillic horizons and lack carbonates in the profile.  Idow, Rakane and Wako soils have duripans more than 10 inches thick.  Lembos soils are calcareous throughout.  Madras, Snowmore and Wendell soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Ochoco soils have 20 percent or more pumice in the solum.  Wellsed soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the Bt and are moist for 10 to 20 day cumulative between July and October."

The soils formed in old alluvium and loess from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 3,000 to 5,500 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 13 inches.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 85 to 130 days."
