  "OVERVIEW": "The Arbidge series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils on fan terraces, plug domes, calderas, tablelands, stream and lacustrine terraces, and alluvial plains.  They formed in old alluvium and loess from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual precipitation is about 280 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 8.2 degrees C.",
