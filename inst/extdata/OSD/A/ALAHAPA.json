Ten percent of the soil surface is covered by a reddish brown (5YR 4/3) brittle crust 1 centimeter (0.5 inches) thick. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Colors are lithochromic at depths below 43 centimeters (17 inches). When described on 11/14/96 the soil was moist throughout. All textures are \"apparent field textures.\" pH was measured using electrode in 1:1 water.) The 2C parts of these horizons consist of unconsolidated `a`a lava fragments of variable size.\n2C1/A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) extremely stony ashy sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) dry; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent 0.3 to 1 centimeter (1/8 to 3/8 inch), rounded, soft to hard, accretionary lapili throughout; 85 percent `a`a lava (10 percent boulders, 40 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel); slightly acid (pH 6.1); abrupt wavy boundary.
