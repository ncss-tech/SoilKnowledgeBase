    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F. These soils are saturated at some season. They are commonly calcareous in all parts after the upper 7 inches has been mixed.  The particle-size control section is 5 to 15 percent clay.  The depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak or moderate platy or subangular blocky structure.  It is very strongly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, and 2 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loam in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe Bkqm horizon commonly is continuously cemented but the range includes fractured weakly cemented to strongly indurated duripans.  Reaction is very strongly alkaline to moderately alkaline above the Bqkm horizon.  Some pedons have a buried A horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 2 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy sand in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from strongly alkaline to mildly alkaline.  It is strongly effervescent to noneffervescent."
