  "OVERVIEW": "The Alegros series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in very gravelly alluvium derived from basaltic andesite lavas.  Alegros soils are on plateaus and fan terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
