  "OVERVIEW": "The Anigon series consists of very deep, well drained soils which are moderately deep to sandy outwash.  These soils formed mostly in loess or silty alluvium underlain by stratified sandy outwash.  Typically they are on outwash plains, valley trains, and stream terraces, but some are on kames, eskers, glacial lake basins, and moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to stratified sandy outwash all range from 20 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy lower subsoil (transition zone). Volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon except it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Free carbonates are absent to depths of more than 5 feet.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where moist value is 3, dry value is greater than 5.5.  Uncultivated areas have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value, dry of 7 or more.  It is silt loam or silt.\nAnigon soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.   The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2Bt transition horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or the gravelly, or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt horizon (2Bt horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) with color like the 2Bt horizon described above.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Typically it is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly."

Native vegetation is dominantly deciduous forest with a few conifers in some areas. Common trees are American elm, American basswood, eastern white pine, red pine, sugar maple, northern red oak, yellow birch, white ash, big tooth aspen, quaking aspen, and black cherry."
