  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to stratified sandy outwash all range from 20 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy lower subsoil (transition zone). Volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon except it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Free carbonates are absent to depths of more than 5 feet.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where moist value is 3, dry value is greater than 5.5.  Uncultivated areas have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value, dry of 7 or more.  It is silt loam or silt.\nAnigon soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.   The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2Bt transition horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or the gravelly, or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt horizon (2Bt horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) with color like the 2Bt horizon described above.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Typically it is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Brill series. A similar soil is the Antigo series.  Brill soils have a zone of saturation with redoximorphic concentrations above the sandy outwash where saturation occurs up to 30 days duration in normal years.  Antigo soils average 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

Brill soils are on less sloping or flatter landscape positions.  Brander, Poskin, and Rib soils are on lower landscape positions associated with apparent water tables, or are adjacent to moraines.\nThe moderately well drained Blackriver and Ribriver soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Maplehurst soils are on nearby landscapes with Anigon soils where the silty mantle is more than 40 inches thick.  Blackriver soils are on less sloping or flatter landscape positions.  Ribriver and Maplehurst soils are on lower landscape positions associated with apparent water tables, or are adjacent to moraines.\nThe well drained Rosholt soils, moderately well drained Scoba and Scott Lake soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Oesterle soils are on nearby landscapes with Anigon soils where the silty mantle is thin or absent.  Rosholt soils are on similar landscape positions.  Scoba, Scott Lake, and Oesterle soils are on lower landscape positions associated with apparent water tables, or are adjacent to moraines."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil have been cleared and are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  In some places, potatoes and snap beans are important crops.  Some areas are used for pastureland and some remain in woodland.  Native vegetation is dominantly deciduous forest with a few conifers in some areas. Common trees are American elm, American basswood, eastern white pine, red pine, sugar maple, northern red oak, yellow birch, white ash, big tooth aspen, quaking aspen, and black cherry."
