Booneville soils have mean annual soil temperature of 2 to 4 degrees C.  Dab soils average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Dailybasin soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Delhew soils have less than 18 percent clay, are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Keman soils have mollic epipedons that are 30 to 50 inches thick.  Lostcannon soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Monibasin soils have mollic epipedons more than 61 centimeters thick and are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section.  Parkalley soils have the base of the argillic horizon between 71 to 89 centimeters from the soil surface and are dominated by flagstones.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Redbird soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 100 centimeters of the soil surface.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Angelwhine soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, tuff, or tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,445 to 3,055 meters (8,000 to 10,000 feet).  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 510 to 1140 millimeters (20 to 45 inches), mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C (36 to 42 degrees F), and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
