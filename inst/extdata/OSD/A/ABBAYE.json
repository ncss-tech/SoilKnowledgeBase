  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The solum ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Sandstone flags and cobble range from 0 to 5 percent and gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent  throughout the pedon.  Some pedons have up to 25 percent gravel in the Bs and B/E horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma 1 or 2. Where present, the Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A, Ap, and E horizons are loamy sand,loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have Bhs horizons.  They have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are sandy loam and fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 or 6. The B horizons are sandy loam or fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 3 to 6, and is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures. The E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures. Some pedons have an E/B horizon. The B/E horizon has fragipan- like characteristics in some pedons.\nSome pedons have separate Bt horizons with colors and textures similar to the B part of the B/E horizon.\nSome pedons have a 2Cr horizon with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6."

Abbaye soils formed in loamy glacial till of Wisconsinan age. The sandstone consists of the Jacobsville formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."
