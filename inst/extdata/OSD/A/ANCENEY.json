  "OVERVIEW": "The Anceney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on escarpments, alluvial fans and relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
