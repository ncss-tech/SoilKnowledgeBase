These soils formed in calcareous till. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers. Mean annual effective precipitation is 22 to 30 inches, much of which falls as snow or as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
