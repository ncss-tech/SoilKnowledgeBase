    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to weathered rock is 60 to 140 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 degrees to 55 degrees F.  The soils between depths of about 4 and 12 inches, are usually moist but are dry from June until October.  Common 1-2 mm concretions are present throughout the upper 60 inches.  Some pedons have up to 25 percent rock fragments, with the larger amounts in the uppermost and lowermost horizons.  Iron oxide plus gibbsite to clay ratio is greater than 0.2  Also kaolinite averages less than 40 percent in the control section.  Depth to a clay layer ranges from about 35 to 45 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 3/4, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 5YR , 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6 and 5/8.  Moist colors are 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6; 5YR 2.5/2, 3/2,3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/2, or 4/4.  Organic matter of the upper 10 inches averages 4 to 6 percent and remains above 3 percent to a depth of 20 inches.  It has moderate or strong granular structure.  It is neutral to medium acid.\nThe BAt and Bt horizons have dry colors of 5YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 4/8, 5/8; 2.5YR 3/6, 4/6, 4/8, 5/6 or 5/8.  Moist colors are 2.5YR 3/6, 4/4, 4/6, 4/8, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8; 5YR 3/6, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6 or 5/8 in the upper part.  Also included in the lower part are colors of 7.5YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4 or 5/6 and 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4 moist.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is clay loam and has an average clay content of 35 to 40 percent.  The lower part of the argillic averages from 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid.  Base saturation ranges from 10 to 35 percent throughout the argillic horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Sites series in the same family and the Hesson, Horseshoe, Prather and Salkum series in other families.  Sites soils have a clay layer within 35 inches of the soil surface.  In addition they have argillic horizons in which the clay content decreases by more than 20 percent above a depth of 60 inches or the argillic horizon is not 60 inches thick.  Hesson, Prather, Salkum soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Horseshoe soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on broad gently sloping tabular ridges with moderately steep to steep sideslopes of 2 to 70 percent at elevations of about 1,200 to 5,000 feet.  They formed in material weathered from basic volcanic rocks, principally tuff breccia.  The climate has warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 85 inches, some of which is snow.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees to 60 degrees F; average January temperature about 40 degrees F; and average July temperature about 72 degrees F.  Freeze-free season is about 130 to 225 days."

McCarthy soils lack argillic horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Aiken soils formerly were classified as clayey, kaolinitic, mesic Xeric Haplohumults.  A review of existing data from both the National Soil Survey Laboratory and the University of California as well as soil survey reports where this soil has been mapped, indicate some variability in the concept.  Some areas have low bulk density in the upper part of the soil, have kaolinitic mineralogy, fine-loamy particle-size control section and base saturation of more than 35 percent at depths of 30 to 70 inches.  Until further investigations can be made on areas mapped in the past, this soil will remain as a clayey, oxidic, mesic Xeric Haplohumult.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Pedons S59CA-005-012 (the series type location which meets Palehumult criteria). The OC is greater than .90 in 17 cm of upper argillic.  Pedon S59CA-005-011 sampled as Aiken which is a Haploxeralf.  Both pedons are in fine, parasesquic, mesic families.\nSeries needs to be reclassified. Poor dispersion in surface horizons suggests possible andic subgroup.  Analyses of Aiken pedons in El Dorado County by Dr. Janis Boettinger, USU, were andic subgroup.  Slope range needs to be narrowed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
