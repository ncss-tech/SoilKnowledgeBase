  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 5 to 10 inches.  Depth to the gypsic horizon ranges from 8 to 40 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 12 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the major part of the solum and C horizon above a depth of 40 inches.  The solum and C horizon above a depth of 40 inches contain 10 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand.  The soils range from neutral to strongly alkaline.  Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR in most pedons, but thin subhorizons of 5YR hue occur in some pedons.  The solum and C horizons are uniform, with only minor stratification."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fraddle (T), Fruita, Gini (T), Mack, Mesa and Tresano (T) series.  Fruita, Mack and Mesa soils have mesic temperature.  Gini soils lack strong accumulations of calcium sulfate and have very gravelly loamy coarse sand in the lower part of the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Fraddle soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Tresano soils do not have a Ccs horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Acacio soils are on slightly elevated ridges in the San Luis Valley Area.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial sediments strongly influenced by basalt or similar ferromagnesian-rich rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer."
