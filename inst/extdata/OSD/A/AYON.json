  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ayon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in very stony calcareous deposits, principally from basalt.  These soils are on alluvial fans and valley sideslopes. Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
