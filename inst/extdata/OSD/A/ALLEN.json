  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 6 to about 15 feet. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed.  Rock fragments range from about 0 to 25 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 15 percent in the B horizon.  The fragments are mostly rounded sandstone and range from 1/4 inch to about 15 inches in diameter.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4.  Severely eroded areas also have hue of 5YR and chroma of 6 or 8.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The fine earth fraction of the A and E horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or rarely silt loam.  Severely eroded areas are also sandy clay loam and clay loam.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hues of 5YR or 2.5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The lower part of the Bt also has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 6 and hues of 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 6.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red range from none to common in the upper part and few to many in the lower part.  The texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and ranges to sandy clay, clay or silty clay below about 3 feet.  In the particle size control section, clay content averages between 20 and 35 percent, sand content between 20 and 55 percent and silt content is 20 percent or more."

Addielou soils have A horizons more than 20 inches thick.  Avilla and Pikeville soils have 15 to 70 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the B horizon.  Bama soils are free of sandstone fragments.  Etowah soils have A horizons with value less than 4. Holston and Norfolk soils have hue 7.5YR or yellower in the B horizon. Leesburg, Minvale, and Nella soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the B horizon.  Octavia soils have a clayey 2Bt horizon with moderately slow permeability. Orangeburg soils have less than 15 percent silt in the particle size control section.  Ruston soils are bisequal.  Smithdale soils have significantly less clay in the lower part of the B horizon.  Jefferson and Nolichucky soils are mesic and Jefferson soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick.  Waynesboro soils have a clayey particle size control section."

These soils formed in loamy alluvium or colluvium and in residuum of sandstone and shale.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 54 inches near the type location."
