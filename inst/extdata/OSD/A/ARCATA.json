  "OVERVIEW": "The Arcata series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Arcata soils are on nearly level to gently sloping, dissected marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 69 centimeters (A1, A2 and A3 horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 69 to 160 centimeters (AB, Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons).\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters, averages 13 percent clay and 34 percent fine sand or coarser.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNASIS User Pedon ID  09CA600653\nNSSL, Lincoln Lab sample number 08N0452\nEdit Log: Arcata was originally proposed in 1965 with well and moderately well drained Map Units.  In 2009 Arcata was revisited and decision made to separate the well and moderately well drained soils, as well as soils under forest canopy and isomesic from clear cut or developed areas that are mesic. This resulted in four separate soil series. The typical pedon was changed in January of 2010 to reflect the original well drained series concept on permanent pasture.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
