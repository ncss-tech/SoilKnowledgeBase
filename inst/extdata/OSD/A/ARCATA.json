Elevations are 4 to 183 meters (10 to 600 feet).  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2285 millimeters (35 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 275 to 325 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 69 centimeters (A1, A2 and A3 horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 69 to 160 centimeters (AB, Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons).\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters, averages 13 percent clay and 34 percent fine sand or coarser.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNASIS User Pedon ID  09CA600653\nNSSL, Lincoln Lab sample number 08N0452\nEdit Log: Arcata was originally proposed in 1965 with well and moderately well drained Map Units.  In 2009 Arcata was revisited and decision made to separate the well and moderately well drained soils, as well as soils under forest canopy and isomesic from clear cut or developed areas that are mesic. This resulted in four separate soil series. The typical pedon was changed in January of 2010 to reflect the original well drained series concept on permanent pasture.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
