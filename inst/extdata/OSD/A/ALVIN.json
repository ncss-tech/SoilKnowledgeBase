Slope commonly is between 3 and 10 percent but ranges from 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed in wind or water-deposited loamy and sandy material of mixed mineralogy. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.1  to 13.9 degrees C (43 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1,143 millimeters (30 to 45 inches), frost free period ranges from 140 to 210 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 427 meters (340 to 1,400 feet) above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Ayrshire soils are on interdunal areas. Bloomfield and Lamont soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby and in some places are closely associated. Camden and Uniontown soils contain more clay and silt, and less sand in the sola and are on outwash plains or stream terraces nearby. Chelsea soils contain more sand in the series control section and have a Bt horizon that consists only of bands or lamella. They are on similar parts of the landscape nearby. The somewhat poorly drained Whitaker soils average more than 18 percent clay in the upper 51 centimeters (20 inches) of the argillic horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Whitaker soils are on lower lying swells of outwash plains and treads of stream terraces nearby."

    "content": "REMARKS: A gravelly substratum phase and a flooded phase of the Alvin series are recognized. These phases will be evaluated and may be proposed as new series. The correlated extent of this series in many MLRAs will be evaluated in future investigations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches) (Ap and BE horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 64 centimeters (11 to 25 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) and from 64 to 152 centimeters (25 to 60 inches) (the Bt part of the E and Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon descriptions and laboratory data for several pedons of Alvin from counties in Illinois are on file in the Illinois NRCS state office or are published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 19. Also lab data is available for several pedons in Indiana and are on file at the Major Land Resource Area office (MO11) at Indianapolis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
