  "OVERVIEW": "The Alvin Series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in wind or water-deposited loamy and sandy materials on outwash plains, dunes, hills, terraces, or high flood-plains steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 millimeters (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Camden and Uniontown soils contain more clay and silt, and less sand in the sola and are on outwash plains or stream terraces nearby. Chelsea soils contain more sand in the series control section and have a Bt horizon that consists only of bands or lamella. They are on similar parts of the landscape nearby. The somewhat poorly drained Whitaker soils average more than 18 percent clay in the upper 51 centimeters (20 inches) of the argillic horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Whitaker soils are on lower lying swells of outwash plains and treads of stream terraces nearby."

    "content": "REMARKS: A gravelly substratum phase and a flooded phase of the Alvin series are recognized. These phases will be evaluated and may be proposed as new series. The correlated extent of this series in many MLRAs will be evaluated in future investigations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches) (Ap and BE horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 64 centimeters (11 to 25 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) and from 64 to 152 centimeters (25 to 60 inches) (the Bt part of the E and Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon descriptions and laboratory data for several pedons of Alvin from counties in Illinois are on file in the Illinois NRCS state office or are published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 19. Also lab data is available for several pedons in Indiana and are on file at the Major Land Resource Area office (MO11) at Indianapolis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
