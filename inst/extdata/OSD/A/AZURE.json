  "OVERVIEW": "The Azure series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils on hills.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from alluvium from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
