    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy material ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The weighted average of the particle size control section is less than 70 percent fine sand or coarser.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 26 to 55 inches, but is commonly 26 to 42 inches.  The solum ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Pebbles and cobbles range from 1 to 10 percent in the solum.\nSome pedons have a 1 to 3 inch A horizon with hue of 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of l or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe E part of the 2B/E has hue of 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 4.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have an E and Bt as separate horizons.  The upper part of the B/E horizons has weak fragipan-like characteristics in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid."

All except the Richter soils have less than 70 percent fine sand or coarser material in the Bs horizons.  In addition, the Zeba soils are underlain by bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches  The Richter soils have reaction more alkaline than slightly acid and textural stratification in the C horizon.  The Belding, Charlevoix, Coral and Richter soils have lower activity clay mineralogy in the particle size control section.  The Robago and Worchester soils have higher activity clay mineralogy in the particle size control section."
