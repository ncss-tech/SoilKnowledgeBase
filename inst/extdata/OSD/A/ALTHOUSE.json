Ardtoo soils have 2C horizons within the series control section.  Beargulch soils are dry fro 75 to 85 consecutive days and have greater than 15 percent mica in the particle-size control section.  Hangtown soils are fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction and are less than 40 inches to the base of the Bw horizon.  Jayar, Smokey, and Umpa soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Minaloosa soils are very deep, contain 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, and have Bt horizons.  Notned and Treble soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, and are moderately coarse textured in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Althouse soils are on mountain side slopes.  Elevations are 3,000 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rock. The climate is characterized by cool, moist to wet winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 50 to 70 inches but in areas of high winter rainfall, may range to 120 inches.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
