  "OVERVIEW": "The Abor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale, residuum from semiconsolidated shale, or semiconsolidated shale interbedded with siltstone or thin layers of sandstone, or in alluvium that is 20 to 40 inches deep over the shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, alluvial fans, and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
