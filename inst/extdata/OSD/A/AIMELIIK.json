    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aimeliik soils are on all hillslope positions of hills on volcanic islands. Slope is 2 to 75 percent. The soils formed in saprolite derived from andesite and basaltic volcanic breccia, tuff, or bedded tuff. They are dominant under Mixed Upland Forest plant communities, but also are under patches of forest in anthropic savannahs vegetation in depositional areas such as toeslopes and lower sideslopes of drainageways where fertility and organic matter contents are relatively high. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Elevation is 1 to 231 meters (3.3 to 758 feet.) The climate is tropical and moist. Because of the strong marine influence, the diurnal and annual range of temperature is limited. Rainfall averages about 3685 millimeters (145 inches) per year and ranges from approximately 2900 to 4400 mm (114 to 173 in.) The seasonal wet (May to November) and dry seasons (December to April) with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 178 to 229 milliliters (7 to 9 inches) per month. Rainfall is derived from convective uplift, which results in short duration rainstorms of high intensity. Rainfall is irregularly distributed geographically. These soils lie within the latitudinal zone that receives more solar radiation than it re-radiates back to space. This imbalance maintains the atmospheric temperatures in a quasi-steady state. The mean daily temperature throughout the year averages 27 C (81 F) with a mean diurnal range of about 4 C (7 F.) Relative humidity averages about 90 percent at night and 75 to 80 percent during the day."

Babelthuap and Ngardmau soils occur on ridges, highly degraded, and support \"degraded\" savanna vegetation dominated by picture plants and false staghorn ferns, which tolerate high aluminum soils. Babelthuap soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 39 inches) deep to solum (saprolite C-horizon.) Ngardmau soils are 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) deep to solum (saprolite C-horizon.) and have subsoil that is too thin to meet the requirements of a kandic horizon. Palau series are under grassland savannas dominated by pandanus and grasses. They have 9 to 12 percent and occur on ancient anthropogenic hillslope terraces."

Agroforestry ground crops include; beans, cassava, kang kong, melon, peppers, noni, okra, pineapple, piper betle, pumpkin, taro squash, sugar cane,  taro, and yams. Agroforestry tree crops include; avocados, bananas, betel nut, breadfruit, football fruit, guava, Inocarpus fagifer, keam, lemons, mango, medicinal plants, mountain apple, ngel, star fruit, titimel, and tropical almond. Most areas are in native tropical rainforest or, to a lesser extent, patches of forest in perennial grassland that is burned by humans almost annually. Native vegetation includes; (canopy) Pinanga insignis, Cyathea sp, Alphitonia carolinensis, Pouteria obovata, Fagraea ksid, Callophyllum inophyllum var. wakamatsui, Rhus taitensis, (understory) Atuna corymbosa, Garcinia matudai, Pleome multiflora, Finschia chloraxantha, Manilkara udoid, Symplocos racemosa, Campnosperma brevipetiolata, Cerbera floribunda."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The A horizon does not become dry for longer than 4 consecutive days and 24 cumulative days per year during the dry season (February, March, and April). Drying only occurs under bare soil conditions. The soil does not meet the definition of an oxic horizon because the clay content increases by more than 8 percent within 15 centimeters (6 inches.) The Ngardok forested series was correlated with Aimeliik, bedded tuff. The Aimeliik, bedded tuff substratum has a platy structure and seems to be more erosive when vegetation is removed. In addition, when Aimeliik occurs near Ollei and Nekken series the rock fragments are likely to be hard basalt and indurated tuff.\nParticle-size distribution measurements are usually not reliable for tropical soils; therefore, apparent field textures and the corresponding mid-point values of texture classes were used rather than laboratory analysis for particle sizes. Particle size distribution is difficult to determine in tropical soils because of the tendency to form water-stable aggregates.  The poor soil dispersion in laboratory analyses reflects the water-stable aggregates of clay in silt and sand-sized \"particles.\" Therefore, the soils may have large clay content but physically they behave as coarser textures.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nFibric soil material - 0 to 4 cm (0 to 2 inches) (Oi horizon)\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches) (A horizon)\nKandic horizon - 8 to 86 cm (3 to 34 inches) (Bo horizon)\nParticle-size control section - 25 to 100 cm (10 to 39 inches)\nAbrupt textural change - 8 cm (0 to 3 inches)\nSoil moisture regime subclass: typic\nSoil moisture regime class: perudic\nMean annual soil temperature: 27 C (81 F)"
