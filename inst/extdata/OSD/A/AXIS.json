After air drying, the reaction is extremely acid in select horizons within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A11 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value 3, and chroma 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or their mucky counterparts.  In some pedons an Oa horizon less than 7 inches thick is present.\nThe A12 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value 3, and chroma 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C1g and C2g horizons have matrix colors in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value that ranges from 4 through 6, and chroma 0 through 2, and have few to many red, yellow, brown, gray, or olive mottles. Texture is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C3g and C4g horizons have matrix colors in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value 4 through 7, and chroma 0 through 2.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have pockets of finer or coarser textured material.  Few to many yellow, brown, olive, and gray mottles are throughout these horizons.  Some pedons may have few to common red mottles.\nThe C5g horizon has the same colors and textures as the C3g and C4g horizons in most pedons.  In addition, this horizon may have matrix colors in hue 2.5Y or 5Y, value 5 or 6, and chroma 3 through 6.  When chromas are more than 2, many medium and coarse mottles in shades of gray are present."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Axis soils are on narrow to broad, level tidal flats.  The elevation ranges from 0 to 3 feet above sea level.  Axis soils are flooded each day with tide waters.  The water table ranges from 12 inches above the surface during high tides to 12 inches below the surface during low tides.  These soils formed in loamy marine sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 63 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included in mapping with Tidal Marsh.  Preliminary data taken from one pedon indicates the sulfur content is lower than required for Sulfaquents.  The samples from the pedon did meet the chemical requirements of halic as outlined by Coover et. al.  (SSSAP 39:703, 1975).  The requirements included percent exchangable Na+Mg greater than 40 percent of cation-exchange capacity and soluble cations greater than 80meq./liter.  As proposed in the paper, the pedon sampled would fit the concept of Typic Halaquents.  Additional data is needed on this and other similar soils prior to recommending changes to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
