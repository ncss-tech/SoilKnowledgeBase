Natural vegetation indicates udic moisture regime.  Changed from Psammentic to Lamellic Glossoboralfs in 1997. Changed to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Hapludalfs in 1998 due to the eighth edition of soil taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 8 inches (A and AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 33 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 8 to 28 inches (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
