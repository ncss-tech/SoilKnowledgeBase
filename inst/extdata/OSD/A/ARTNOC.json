  "OVERVIEW": "The Artnoc series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terrace escarpments.  They formed in silty glaciolacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",

Changed to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Hapludalfs in 1998 due to the eighth edition of soil taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 8 inches (A and AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 33 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 8 to 28 inches (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
