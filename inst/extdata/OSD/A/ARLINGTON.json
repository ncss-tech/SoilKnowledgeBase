  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 65 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 8 and 24 inches usually is moist in some part from about December 1 until late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  Depth to the cemented horizon is 24 to 40 inches.  The A horizon is brown to pale brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/3, 5/4) coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Organic matter averages less than 1 percent in the A horizon.  The B2t horizon is yellowish brown in 10YR hue, brown or strong brown in 7.5YR hue or reddish brown in 5YR hue.  It is heavy sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and has less than 18 percent clay.  This horizon has weak to strong angular blocky structure in some or all parts.  Except for some pedons with an Ap horizon the upper boundary of the B2t horizon is clear or gradual or there is an A3 or Bl horizon and the absolute clay increase from A horizon to B2t horizon is about 4 to 8 percent.  The B2t horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Some pedons lack a B3t horizon.  The B3t horizon is similar to or less red than the B2t horizon.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and is calcareous with segregated lime in most pedons.  The Csi horizon is brown, pale brown, yellowish brown or light yellowish brown, dominantly in 10YR hue.  In most pedons color is not uniform and there are streaks, seams and blotches of the colors listed.  The structural units are prisms or are prism-like and usually are about 6 to 24 inches in diameter.  They are coated with light gray or white (10YR 7/2D8/1) amorphous siliceous material about 0.1 to 0.3mm in thickness.  Coatings are dominantly on the sides of peds, some as bridges, but are incomplete or mostly lacking on the top of the prisms.  The prisms are slightly to moderately brittle when moist and are very firm or extremely firm.  Thin seams of calcium carbonate and a few flattened exped roots occur between the siliceous coatings of the prisms in some pedons."

The climate is one of long dry summers and short mild winters with an average annual precipitation of 10 to 15 inches.  The average January temperature is 51 degrees F., average July temperature is 76 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 63 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 240 to 320 days."
