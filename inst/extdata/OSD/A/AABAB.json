  "OVERVIEW": "The Aabab series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed sedimentary alluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone. Aabab soils are on river terraces and proglacial lakes on till plains and slopes are 0 to 5 percent slope. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
