These soils formed from mixed sedimentary alluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone. They occur in a coastal marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 120 inches. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., mean July temperature is 60 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is about 160 to 220 days."
