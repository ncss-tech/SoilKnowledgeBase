Alukw'at watam translates to frog lake in the Yakama language. The type location for the series is about 800 m east of Tadpole Lake, on the Yakama Reservation.\n5/2016--This official series description was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting; no major technical changes were made.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nPartial laboratory data--sample number 38D-27-1; Yakima Nation Soil Laboratory; Toppenish, Washington\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
