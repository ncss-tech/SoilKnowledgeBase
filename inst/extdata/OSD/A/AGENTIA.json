They are usually dry, and are dry in the moisture control section for 100 to 120 days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 30 inches.  The mollic epipedon and depth to bedrock is 25 to 40 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 10 to 15 inches.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 40 percent stones and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content is 30 to 60 percent.  It has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 10 to 30 percent glass and glass coated aggregate and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and contains 20 to 40 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam or sandy loam and contains 0 to 30 percent gravel, 10 to 20 stones and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent, and moderately or strongly alkaline."

The soils formed in  colluvium derived from basalt with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
