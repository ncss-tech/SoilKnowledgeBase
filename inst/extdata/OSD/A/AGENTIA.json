  "OVERVIEW": "The Agentia series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Agentia soils are on north slopes of  canyons and have slopes of  40 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

It has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 10 to 30 percent glass and glass coated aggregate and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and contains 20 to 40 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
