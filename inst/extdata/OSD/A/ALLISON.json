  "OVERVIEW": "The Allison series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in stratified moderately fine and medium textured alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches).",

Anthon soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments throughout the series control section. Huntsville, Lindstrom, Napier, and Worthen soils contain less than 27 percent clay in the control section.  Ivan soils are calcareous throughout.  Judson soils have more strongly developed structure and lack strata or lenses of coarser textured material in the lower part of the B horizon.  Kahola soils are calcareous in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and within the control section.  Kennebec soils lack a B horizon and have chroma of 1 or 2 to depths of 152 cm (5 feet) or more.  Kenridge soils have less than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Sturkie soils contain more sand in the upper part of the control section. Rossville soils have less than 27 percent clay content in the lower part of the series control section."

Emma soils are on similar nearby landscapes, lack mollic epipedons and have more acid reaction throughout the solum."
