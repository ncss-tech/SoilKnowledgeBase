Anthon soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments throughout the series control section. Huntsville, Lindstrom, Napier, and Worthen soils contain less than 27 percent clay in the control section.  Ivan soils are calcareous throughout.  Judson soils have more strongly developed structure and lack strata or lenses of coarser textured material in the lower part of the B horizon.  Kahola soils are calcareous in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and within the control section.  Kennebec soils lack a B horizon and have chroma of 1 or 2 to depths of 152 cm (5 feet) or more.  Kenridge soils have less than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Sturkie soils contain more sand in the upper part of the control section. Rossville soils have less than 27 percent clay content in the lower part of the series control section."

These soils formed in stratified moderately fine and medium textured alluvium.  Mean annual temperature varies from 10.6 to 13.9 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 890 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches)."

In addition, Karnak soils contain more clay in the control section and Comfrey soils contain more sand in the control section.  The somewhat poorly drained Tice soils are on slightly lower parts of the flood plain and have mottles within 41 cm (16 inches) of the soil surface or gray colors within 15 cm (6 inches) below the mollic epipedon and have a mollic epipedon less than 61 cm (24 inches) thick.  Emma soils are on similar nearby landscapes, lack mollic epipedons and have more acid reaction throughout the solum."
