  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Axtell soils were formerly included in the Crockett series. More recently the Edge, Gredge, and Kurten series have been separated out of the Axtell series because they have thinner sola with less clay in the lower Bt horizons. This revision confines the Axtell series to stream terraces or terrace remnants in upland positions. This will reduce the total acres of the series. However, it will still be largely extensive.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in)\nRedox depletions with chroma 2 or less: 20 to 53 cm (8 to 21 in)\nArgillic horizon: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 203 in)\nRedox concentrations: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in)\nSlickensides: 53 to 94 cm (21 to 37 in)\nSecondary carbonates: 94 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in)\nGypsum accumulations: 94 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in)\nAbrupt textural change: At the upper boundary of the Bt horizon\nVertic features: COLE is 0.07 to 0.10\nADDITIONAL DATA: McLennan County, Texas: Soil Survey Laboratory Memo 2; 1954; Profiles 53, 54, 55, and Typical Pedon: Navarro County, Texas: 84TX349001\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
