  "OVERVIEW": "The Arave series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary rocks.  Arave soils are on lake plains and low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
