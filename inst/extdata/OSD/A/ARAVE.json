    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arave soils are on lake plains and low lake terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived mainly from limestone, shale, sandstone, and quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 8 to 18 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 8 to 18 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 20 and 40 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the C1 and C2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 18 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nThe revision of October 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Aquic Natrustalfs to Aquic Natrixeralfs based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.  Later review of laboratory data places the typical pedon in the active class.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 136-137, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
