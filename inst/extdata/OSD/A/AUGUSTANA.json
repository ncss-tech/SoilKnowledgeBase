The dense till ranges from 3 to 10 percent clay and contains less than 72 percent sand.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry color has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E/B horizon when present does not meet the criteria for a glossic horizon.  The E part has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or silt loam. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2BC horizon, when present, is typically 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or silt loam. This horizon has redoximorphic features in most pedons. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon when present has a hue of 5YR, value of 3, 4, or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3BCd horizon has a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have mainly complex slopes of 3 to 8 percent.  They are on back slopes and summits of moraines.  This soil formed in a discontinuous mantle of eolian or water laid sediments and the underlying friable loamy till and the underlying dense loamy till. The till is from the Superior Lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 750 mm. The frost free season ranges from 120 to 140 days. The elevation ranges from 300 to 500 meters above sea level."

Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.  2/11/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
