These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The control section averages 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments and 18 to 35 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It has weak or moderate structure.  It is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam with 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Structure is moderate or strong subangular blocky.  Organic carbon is less than 1 percent.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam or loam or sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons lack a 2Bk horizon and have a 2BC horizon."
