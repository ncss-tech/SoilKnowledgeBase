  "OVERVIEW": "The Annum series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from granitic rocks with a mantle of loess.  Annum soils are on broad summits, shoulder, and toeslopes of hills and have slopes of 8 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The control section averages 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments and 18 to 35 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It has weak or moderate structure.  It is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam with 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Structure is moderate or strong subangular blocky.  Organic carbon is less than 1 percent.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam or loam or sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons lack a 2Bk horizon and have a 2BC horizon."
