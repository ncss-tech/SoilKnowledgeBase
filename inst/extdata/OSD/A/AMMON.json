  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. The soils are usually dry, and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for about 70 to 80 days in late summer. The 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly silt loam and averages 8 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand. The organic matter decreases regularly with increasing depth to a level of 0.5 percent or less within a depth of 50 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon when mixed to 7 inches has chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak or moderate platy or weak granular structure, and 1.2 to 2.5 percent organic matter. This horizon ranges from noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is massive or has weak granular, very weak subangular blocky, or very weak prismatic structure.  This horizon contains 0 to 20 percent hard nodules of soil material or cicada krotovinas. It is moderately or slightly calcareous and contains less than 15 percent calcium carbonate, and has some soft powdery secondary lime above a depth of 43 inches."

Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in deep alluvium from loessal materials. the climate is semiarid with dry summer. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 2 to 5 feet of snowfall. Average freeze-free period is 94 to 126 days."
