  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Allard series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium or lacustrine deposits that overlie stratified sand and gravel. They are on outwash terraces and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum, with gravelly subhorizons in some pedons, and from 0 to 70 percent in the 2C horizon. Rock fragments are dominated by sedimentary source material with some erratics of igneous or metamorphic origin.\nThe Ap on a horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. The Ap horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure and very friable or friable consistence. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Bw horizons have weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky structure except some subhorizons can be massive. Consistence is very friable to firm, some pedons may have a BC horizon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from sand to extremely gravelly loamy sand. The material is commonly single grain and loose with some pedons having discontinuous subhorizons that are weakly cemented. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Currently, there are no other series in the same family. The Enfield series were in the same family, but have not been updated to the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Enfield soils have rock fragments dominated by acid igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nThe Abenaki, Alton, Barbour, Chenango, Hadley, Hamlin, Hartland, Haven, Merrimac, Pompton, Pope, Riverhead, Scio, Tioga, and Unadilla series are members of similar families.  Alton and Chenango soils contain more rock fragments in the solum. Barbour, Hadley, Hamlin, Pope, and Tioga soils have irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth.  Haven soils have more sand in the solum. Abenaki and Cloquet soils are in colder regions. Merrimac, Pompton, and Riverhead soils have more sand in the solum and lack contrasting C horizons. Hartland, Scio, and Unadilla soils are in deep silty deposits to a depth of at least 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Allard soils are on old alluvial terraces and outwash terraces above the flood plains of streams in glaciated areas. Allard soils usually do not flood, except in some areas they flood very rarely during violent storms. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in old alluvium, Aeolian or lacustrine deposits that form a thin mantle over sand and gravel from glacial outwash or deltaic deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F., and mean growing season ranges from 130 to 180 days."

Chenango soils are on nearby terrace that lack the silty mantle. Unadilla soils are on terraces that have deep silty deposits. Tioga soils are on nearby flood plains."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 24 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Estimated CEC activity class as active."
