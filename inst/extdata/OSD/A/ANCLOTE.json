    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of sand is 60 inches or more.  The content of silt plus clay is less than 15 percent in the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control sections.  Soil reaction is strongly acid through moderately alkaline throughout.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick and contains from 2 to 15 percent organic matter.\nA thin Oa horizon is present in some pedons and is generally less than 5 inches in thickness.  Where present, it has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is muck.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray or pockets of sand not coated with organic matter range from none to common in the lower part of the A horizon.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand or their mucky analogs.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known series in the same family.  Closely related soils include Astor, Chobee, Delray, and Manatee series.  Astor soils are on similar positions and have mollic epipedons 24 to 60 inches thick.  Chobee, Delray, and Manatee soils are on similar positions and have argillic horizons.  In addition, Chobee soils have fine-loamy subsoils, Delray soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness, and Manatee soils have coarse-loamy subsoils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 52 to 57 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from about 74 to 77 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Basinger, Immokalee, Myakka and Wabasso soils are on similar positions, are acid, and have Bh horizons.  Bluff soils have fine-loamy control sections. Boca soils are moderately deep to limestone bedrock. Felda and Floridana soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  Holopaw soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness. Malabar and Pineda soils have Bw and argillic horizons. Oldsmar soils have spodic horizons. Placid and Sellers soils are on similar positions and have umbric epipedons.  The somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on higher positions and have Bh horizons.  Pompano soils are on similar positions but lack a mollic epipedon.  Samsula soils have muck layers 16 to 51 inches in thickness while Terra Ceia soils are mucky throughout. Valkaria soils have cambic horizons and do not have mollic epipedons. The poorly drained Winder soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have fine-loamy subsoils."

Depressional areas are frequently ponded during the rainy season.\nAnclote soils are in MLRAs 155, 154, 156A and 156B.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data is provided by the University of Florida, Department of Soil and Water Science, Gainesville, FL.  http://soils.ifas.ufl.edu/flsoils/index.asp\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
