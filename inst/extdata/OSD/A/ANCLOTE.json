  "OVERVIEW": "The Anclote series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils in depressions, poorly defined drainage ways, and flood plains in the Southern Florida Flatwoods (MLRA 155), South Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 154), Florida Everglades and Associated Areas (156A) and Southern Florida Lowlands (MLRA 156B).  They formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature ranges from 68 to 75 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 47 to 56 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Soil reaction is strongly acid through moderately alkaline throughout.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick and contains from 2 to 15 percent organic matter.\nA thin Oa horizon is present in some pedons and is generally less than 5 inches in thickness.  Where present, it has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is muck.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray or pockets of sand not coated with organic matter range from none to common in the lower part of the A horizon.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand or their mucky analogs.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known series in the same family.  Closely related soils include Astor, Chobee, Delray, and Manatee series.  Astor soils are on similar positions and have mollic epipedons 24 to 60 inches thick.  Chobee, Delray, and Manatee soils are on similar positions and have argillic horizons.  In addition, Chobee soils have fine-loamy subsoils, Delray soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness, and Manatee soils have coarse-loamy subsoils."

Basinger, Immokalee, Myakka and Wabasso soils are on similar positions, are acid, and have Bh horizons.  Bluff soils have fine-loamy control sections. Boca soils are moderately deep to limestone bedrock. Felda and Floridana soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  Holopaw soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness. Malabar and Pineda soils have Bw and argillic horizons. Oldsmar soils have spodic horizons. Placid and Sellers soils are on similar positions and have umbric epipedons.  The somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on higher positions and have Bh horizons.  Pompano soils are on similar positions but lack a mollic epipedon.  Samsula soils have muck layers 16 to 51 inches in thickness while Terra Ceia soils are mucky throughout. Valkaria soils have cambic horizons and do not have mollic epipedons. The poorly drained Winder soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have fine-loamy subsoils."

Depressional areas are frequently ponded during the rainy season.\nAnclote soils are in MLRAs 155, 154, 156A and 156B."
