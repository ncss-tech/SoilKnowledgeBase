  "OVERVIEW": "The Amber series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous alluvium.  They are on risers between low flood plains and high flood plains or on risers between high flood plains and low terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.",

Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  They are rarely flooded for very brief periods during March through October.  These soils formed in calcareous alluvium.  The climate is subhumid.  Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 63 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is 26 to 38 inches; Thornthwaite P-E indices of 44 to 64; Elevation ranges from 700 to 1500 feet.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230."
