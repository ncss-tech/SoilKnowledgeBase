  "OVERVIEW": "The Alapai series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic volcanic ash. Alapai soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 3048 millimeters (120 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

The soils are on all hillslope positions of nearly level to steep lava flows. Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to 3,810 millimeters (60 to 150 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1,270 meters (25 to 50 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 16 to 21 degrees C (61 to 70 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
