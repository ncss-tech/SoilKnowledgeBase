Honaunau, Honuapo and Makaala soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  Kailua soils are silty clay in the control section.  Kealakekua soils are 30 to 48 inches deep over bedrock. Kukaiau soils are at elevations of 500 to 1,500 feet and have corresponding mean annual soil temperature about 68 degrees F. and the B horizon irreversibly dehydrates into sand and silt sized aggregates."

The soils are on all hillslope positions of nearly level to steep lava flows. Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to 3,810 millimeters (60 to 150 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1,270 meters (25 to 50 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 16 to 21 degrees C (61 to 70 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
