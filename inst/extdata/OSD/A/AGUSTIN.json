  "OVERVIEW": "The Agustin series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in mixed fan alluvium.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
