  "OVERVIEW": "The Atherton series consists of deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in water-sorted materials. They are nearly level soils on outwash plains, terraces and kame-kettle landforms. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 through 44 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 through 20 percent in horizons in the upper part of the solum including up to 15 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. The weighted average rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the particle control section, including up to 5 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. Rock fragments in the substratum ranges to 60 percent. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the A horizon and from moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have mucky modifiers.\nStructure is weak or moderate granular or fine subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. In pedons with A horizons thickness can range from 1 through 6 inches.\nIn uncleared areas A horizons are 4 through 8 inches thick and have color value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry. They may be underlain by E horizons 1 through 6 inches thick that have chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 0 through 2 and has redoximorphic features. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bw or 2Bw horizon, which is usually in contrasting materials, has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 or 4 and it has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction with thin layers of gravel, sand, or silty clay in some pedons. They are massive or they have moderate prismatic or blocky structure. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4 and it has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Some pedons may have 10Y hue (gleyed) in the C or 2C. They are stratified with texture in the fine earth fraction typically ranging from loam through silty clay loam, but including textures from sand through silty clay."
