  "OVERVIEW": "The Antoken series consists of very deep, well drained soils on canyons.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from basalt with an influence of loess in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and he mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
