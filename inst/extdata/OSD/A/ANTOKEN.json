The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 58 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and solum depth is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  It has an increase of 20 to 30 percent clay (absolute) within a vertical distance of 1 to 3 inches in the upper part. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 60 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel and 15 to 20 percent clay.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB horizon has similar color to that of the A horizon.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam.  It contains 30 to 50 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent clay.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay.  It contains 15 to 35 percent cobbles, 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent stones.  The soil reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 3Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is strongly to violently effervescent and has 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It contains 15 to 40 percent cobbles, 0 to 25 percent stones and 15 to 25 percent gravel."

The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from basalt with an influence of loess in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
