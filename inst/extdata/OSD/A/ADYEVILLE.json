Greenwich, Grosstown, Swedesboro and Unicorn soils do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) and formed in coastal plain deposits. Philomont soils do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) and formed in residuum from gneiss and granite."

Adyeville soils formed in residuum from interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale that is dominantly moderately or less cemented. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation range from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200.

The somewhat excessively drained Tipsaw and well drained Wellston soils are on similar landform positions as are the Adyeville soils. The moderately well drained Ebal, Kitterman, and Deuchars soils are on scarps and benches of hills underlain with shale interbedded with sandstone."
