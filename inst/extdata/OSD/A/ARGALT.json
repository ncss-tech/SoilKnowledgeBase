  "OVERVIEW": "The Argalt series consists of shallow or very shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt bedrock with a mixture of eolian material high in volcanic glass.  The Argalt soils are on basalt flow plateaus and mesas.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
