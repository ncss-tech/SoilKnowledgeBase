These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt with a mixture of eolian material high in volcanic glass.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,650 to 2,350 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
