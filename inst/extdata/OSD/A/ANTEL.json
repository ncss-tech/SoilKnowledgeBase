  "OVERVIEW": "The Antel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty textured alluvium from mixed sediments of mostly volcanic rocks, tuff, loess and volcanic ash.  The Antel soils are on fan skirts and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
