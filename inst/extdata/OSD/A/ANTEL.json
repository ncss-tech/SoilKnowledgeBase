These soils formed in silty textured alluvium from mixed sediments of mostly volcanic rocks, tuffs, loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,405 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
