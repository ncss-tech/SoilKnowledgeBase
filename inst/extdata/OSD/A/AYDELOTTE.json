It is loam or clay loam with a clay content of 17 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have BA horizons from 2 to 6 inches thick.  Where present, it has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is clay loam, and reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, or hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons are clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam with the clay ranging from 35 to 55 percent.  Slickensides are not in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the Bt1 horizon, and the Bt2 horizon is moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon occurs in some pedons and is clay or shale with colors similar to the Bt3 horizon.  Thin seams of sandstone less than 3 inches thick are in a few pedons."

Agan soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon and have perched water tables.  Agra, Kirkland, and Renfrow soils have mollic epipedons.  Axtell, Crockett, Crosstell, Navo, and Tabor soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Callisburg, Chigley, Hamby, Minwells, Pedernales, Truce, Voca, Windthorst, and Winters soils have a COLE less than 0.07.  In addition, the Chigley, Truce, Voca, and Windthorst soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Chaney, Chazos, and Straber soils have a COLE less than 0.07, have sola less than 60 inches thick, and have perched water tables.  Normangee and Steedman soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Ponder soils decrease in clay content by more than 20 percent within 60 inches of the soil surface."

These soils formed in materials weathered from shale of Permian age.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches. Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 48 to 64.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1500 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Aydelotte soils were formerly mapped as eroded phases of the Renfrow series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - zone from the surface to about 6 inches.  (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - zone from 6 to 63 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nUdertic features - soils that have cracks at some period in most years that are 1 cm or more wide at a depth of 20 inches, that are at least 12 inches long in some part, and extend upward to the surface; have COLE of 0.07 or more in a horizon or horizons that are at least 20 inches thick; have potential linear extensibility of 6 cm or more in the upper 50 inches of the soil; have 35 percent or more clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon; and the depth to secondary lime is below a depth of 28 inches.\nPaleustalfs features - soils that have an ustic moisture regime; have an ochric epipedon; have an argillic horizon and have base saturation of 35 percent or more at a depth of 72 inches below the soil surface; have an argillic horizon in which the upper part has a clayey particle-size class and there is an increase of at least 15 percent clay (absolute) within a vertical distance of 1 inch at the upper boundary or have an argillic horizon that has a clay distribution such that the percentage of clay does not decrease by as much as 20 percent of the maximum within a depth of 60 inches from the soil surface and has hues redder than 10YR and chroma of 5 or more in the matrix of the Bt3 horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
