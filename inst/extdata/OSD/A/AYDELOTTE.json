  "OVERVIEW": "The Aydelotte series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from shale of Permian age.  These very gently sloping to sloping soils are on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",
