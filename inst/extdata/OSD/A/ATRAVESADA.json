The moisture control section of 7 to 20 inches is moist from November 15 to June 15 and dry from July 1 to September 15 in most years. The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. from April 15 to November 15. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F. Gravel content and serpentinite channers in the profile are 5 to 15 percent. Pedons have chrysotile asbestos fibers in the soil layers.\nThe A horizon has color of 7.5YR 4/2; 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 5/1.   Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 2/1, 2/2 or 3/2. Organic matter content is 5 to 8 percent.  Texture is sandy loam or loam. Clay content is 16 to 26 percent. Chrysotile asbestos is present in the sand fraction.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 3/3, 5/3 or 2.5Y 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 2/3, 3/3 or 2.5Y 4/4. Moist values and chromas of 4 are in multicolored layers and are not dominant colors. Organic matter content is 2 to 4 percent. Texture is loam or sandy clay loam. Clay content is 20 to 34 percent and is at least 1.2 times higher than the A horizon. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."
