  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Atascosa soils are on moderately steep to very steep hills and mountains at elevations ranging from 3,300 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 30 to 45 percent but range from 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium from rhyolitic conglomerate and rhyolitic tuff.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 66 degrees F. and typically the average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches, but the series has been mapped in areas as dry as 12 inches, occurring mainly as thundershowers in July and August and as gentle rains in the late fall and winter months. May and June are the driest months.  The frost-free season ranges from 170 to 250 days."
