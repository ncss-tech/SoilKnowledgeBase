  "OVERVIEW": "The Avenal series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Avenal soils occur on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils between depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry in all parts from mid-April to mid-January.  Mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 71 degrees F.  Soil temperatures are warmer than 47 degrees F at all times.  The soil is not continuously moist in some part for 90 consecutive days.  The reaction is neutral at the surface, becoming slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline with increasing depth.  The soils are noneffervescent in the A horizon and increases in effervescence with increasing depth.  Conductivity is less than 2 mmhos and the SAR is 1 or less.  Total sand in the profile ranges from 25 to 35 percent and slit from 35 to 45 percent.  Some pedons have only a very small amount of mica.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 6/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2 or 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 3/2 or 4/2.  It is heavy loam or silt loam.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4 or 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3; or 2.5Y 4/2.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam and has 1.2 to 1.3 times as much clay as in the A horizon.  Clay is 27 to 35 percent.  Thin to moderately thick clay films are present on faces of peds.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 7/4; 2.5Y 5/2 or 4/4 and moist color of 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4 or 5/4.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam."

Anway, Berino, Bucklebar, Cornville, Dona Ana, Hap, Madurez, Palomas, Tijeras, and Tres Hermanos soils are moist in the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days in the summer.  Berino, Cornville, Dona Ana, Hap, Madurez and Mohave soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 40 inches.  Garlock soils are noneffervescent in the upper 40 inches.  Hi Vista soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Milham soils have 35 to 60 percent total sand, 10 to 35 percent total silt, are effervescent throughout, and have a large amount of mica.  Mirage soils have conductivity of 20 to 70 mmho and SAR of 13 to 40.  Neuralia soils have 35 to 45 degress F. difference between mean summer and winter soil temperature.  Tres Hermanos soils have a gravelly Bt horizon."
