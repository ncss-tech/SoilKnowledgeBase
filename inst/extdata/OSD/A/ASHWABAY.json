The somewhat poorly drained Sunkencamp soils are on lower landscape positions and are in a drainage sequence with Ashwabay soils.  The moderately well drained Cublake soils have loamy deposits at 40 to 60 inches below the sand, and are on similar landscape positions.  The moderately well drained Kellogg soils have 20 to 40 inches of sandy deposits above the clay and are on similar landscape positions.  The well drained Manistee soils also have 20 to 40 inches of sandy deposits above the clay and are on higher landscape positions."
