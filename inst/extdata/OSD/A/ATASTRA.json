  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atastra soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on concave footslope or backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.   Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,585 to 3,048 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
