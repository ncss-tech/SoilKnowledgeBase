  "OVERVIEW": "The Anezul series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or residuum derived from volcanic rock. These soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains. Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
