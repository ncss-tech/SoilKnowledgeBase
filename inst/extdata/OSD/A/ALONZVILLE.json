  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Bailegap, Hambrook, Harmiller, Jefferson, Keener, Lily, Lonewood, Marr, McCamy, Raftville, Riney, Sassafras, and Sunnyside are soils in the same family. The Gunstock soils are in a related family and may become a competitor when it is updated to the ninth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Bailegap soils formed in residuum of sandstone and have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches. Hambrook soils formed in marine sediments and have rock fragments dominated by quartzite. Harmiller soils formed in metasediments and have a paralithic contact between 20 to 40 inches of the surface. Jefferson soils, which are not subjected to stream overflow, formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The rock fragment lithologies are more reflective of the local geology and have been worn by soil creep. Keener soils formed in colluvium from metasediments and have rock fragments dominated by metasedimentary lithologies. Lily soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Lonewood soils have a silty B horizon and sola thicker than 50 inches. Marr and Sassafras soils formed in coastal plain sediments and do not have rock fragments derived from sandstone, siltstone, or shale. McCamy and Raftville soils have a lithic contact between 20 to 40 inches. Riney and Sunnyside soils have hue redder than 7.5YR. Gunstock soils formed in residuum of phyllite and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Broadway, Clubcaf, Gladehill, Gullion, Newmarc, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils have mollic epipedons and are on flood plains. Botetourt, Caverns, and Ingledove soils have higher base saturations and are on similar landscapes. Coursey soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landscapes. Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on flood plains. Frederick and Groseclose soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on uplands. Moomaw soils have fragipans and are on terraces. Shottower soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on high terraces."
