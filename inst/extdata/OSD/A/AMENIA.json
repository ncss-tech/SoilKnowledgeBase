  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 18 to 36 inches and depth to carbonates range from 10 to 34 inches. The carbonates are nearly all of calcium. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 4 to 35 percent by volume throughout the soil.\nUndisturbed pedons have A horizons 4 to 7 inches thick. The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chromas of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular and consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a A/B or AB horizon up to 6 inches thick.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky or granular, and consistence is very friable to firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has moderate to weak subangular blocky or platy structure.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive and may part to plate-like divisions or has platy structure. Consistence is firm or very firm. Some pedons have a friable C horizon above the Cd. Reaction is slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Benson, Farmington, Georgia, Grenville, Herkimer, Hogansburg, Nellis, Pittsfield, and Stockbridge series are similar soils in related families. Benson and Farmington soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 inches. Georgia soils are more acid in the solum and have free carbonates at a greater depth. Grenville and Hogansburg soils have a frigid temperature regime. Nellis, Pittsfield and Stockbridge soils lack low chroma depletions within a depth of 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Amenia soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soil formed in calcareous, loamy till that in some places is covered by a thin silty mantle. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 45 inches, and mean frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days. The elevation ranges from 95 to 1100 feet above sea level."

The well drained Nellis, somewhat poorly drained Massena, and poorly drained Sun soils are drainage associates. The Galway soils and the Bensen and Farmington soils are associated where the soil mantle is moderately deep and shallow respectively over bedrock. Pittsfield and Stockbridge soils are on nearby landscapes where the depth to free carbonates is greater."
