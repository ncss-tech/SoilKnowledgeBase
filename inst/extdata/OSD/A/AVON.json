  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F. The soil is usually moist, but it is dry in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch depth for more than 60 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe soil contains a component of volcanic ash. The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 36 inches in thickness and includes the A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry and 1 or 2 moist, and chroma between 1 and 2. Structure ranges from weak to moderate, fine to medium granular. The A horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline and is dominantly noncalcareous, but some are slightly calcareous due to recent deposits or rodent activity.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist, and dominant chroma of 1 or 2, except that where hue is 2.5Y some pedons have chroma of 3. The B2t horizon is silty clay, clay or heavy silty clay loam. it has weak to strong, medium prismatic or moderate angular blocky structure. Clay films range from common to continuous. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from silty clay loam to silt loam, and some pedons contain 10 to 40 percent of unweathered tuffaceous pebbles and cobblestones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Avon soils are on high lake terraces at elevations ranging from 4,600 to 5,150 feet. Slope gradients are dominantly 1 to 10 percent and range from 0 to 20 percent. Avon soils formed in lacustrine or alluvial fan sediments that contain a component of volcanic ash. The climate is moist subhumid. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 47 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 65 degrees to 67 degrees F. The freeze-free period ranges from 110 to 140 days."
