  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arikara soils are on strongly sloping to very steep north- and east-facing slopes in stream dissected uplands and in the North Dakota Badlands.  Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium from soft sedimentary bedrock.  The mean annual temperature is from 39 to 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches, frost-free period ranges from 120 to 135 days and elvevation ranges from 1650 to 3600 feet."

Cabba soils are on steep ridgetops and side slopes and are shallow to soft bedrock. Cherry and Shambo soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping fans and terraces.  Lambert soils are on strongly sloping to steep west-and south-facing side slopes and foot slopes.  Badland is steep barren land."
