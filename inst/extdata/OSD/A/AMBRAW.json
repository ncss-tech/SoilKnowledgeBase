Darwin soils contain more clay throughout, have high shrink-swell characteristics, and occupy lower lying slackwater areas further away from main river channels. The poorly drained Gorham soils have less sand in the control section and are on similar positions. McFain soils have more clay in the upper part of the control section, have contrasting particle-size classes, and are in depressions on the flood plain. The somewhat poorly drained Riley soils have contrasting particle-size classes and are on slightly higher parts of the flood plain. Selma soils have less clay and more sand in the lower part of the series control section and are at slightly higher elevations on stream terraces and outwash plains. Titus soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are in lower lying slackwater areas further from the river channel."

Where drained, an apparent seasonal high water table is within 1 foot of the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In an undrained condition, the apparent seasonal high water table is within 0.5 foot of the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. These soils are subject to rare to frequent flooding for brief to long periods between November and June in normal years."
