The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness. The particle-size control section averages between 24 and 35 percent clay, 15 and 50 percent fine sand or coarser, and less than 7 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam. Clay content ranges from 10 to 35 percent and sand content ranges from 5 to 70 percent. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has properties as follows. The upper part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, clay, or loam. Clay content ranges from 25 to 42 percent and sand content ranges from 20 to 40 percent. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe lower part of the Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Clay content ranges from 24 to 35 percent and sand content ranges from 20 to 60 percent. Volume of coarse fragments is less than 7 percent. It is strongly acid to neutral. Reaction increases as depth increases.\nThe BCg or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is most commonly clay loam or sandy clay loam, or less commonly sandy loam or loam. Clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent and sand content ranges from 20 to 60 percent. Volume of coarse fragments is less than 7 percent. The BCg or Cg horizon commonly contains strata. The strata are loam, sandy loam, silt loam, loamy sand, or sand. The BCg horizon is moderately acid to neutral. The Cg horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gansner, Ozamis, and Sloan series. Gansner soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick and do not have a cambic horizon.  Ozamis soils do not have a cambic horizon. Sloan soils typically contain carbonates within 50 inches, and average less than 35 percent sand in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ambraw soils are on flood plains or low terraces of large streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in stratified loamy alluvium. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 45 inches, frost-free period ranges from 140 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 340 to 1300 feet above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allison, Beaucoup, Darwin, Gorham, McFain, Riley, Selma, and Titus soils. The well drained Allison soils have less sand in the control section and are on slightly higher topographic positions. Beaucoup soils have less sand in the control section and are on similar positions. Darwin soils contain more clay throughout, have high shrink-swell characteristics, and occupy lower lying slackwater areas further away from main river channels. The poorly drained Gorham soils have less sand in the control section and are on similar positions. McFain soils have more clay in the upper part of the control section, have contrasting particle-size classes, and are in depressions on the flood plain. The somewhat poorly drained Riley soils have contrasting particle-size classes and are on slightly higher parts of the flood plain. Selma soils have less clay and more sand in the lower part of the series control section and are at slightly higher elevations on stream terraces and outwash plains. Titus soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are in lower lying slackwater areas further from the river channel."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained.Permeability is moderate or moderately slow. Where drained, an apparent seasonal high water table is within 1 foot of the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In an undrained condition, the apparent seasonal high water table is within 0.5 foot of the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. These soils are subject to rare to frequent flooding for brief to long periods between November and June in normal years."

These soils will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if new series are needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 14 to 45 inches (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and BCg horizons);aquic conditions - chroma of 0 or 1 and redoximorphic features in all horizons below the mollic epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: In Iowa, the native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Bluejoint Grasses, Fowl Bluegrasses, Green Muhlies, Fox Sedges, Field Sedges, Dudleys Rushes, Torreys Rushes, Swamp Milkweeds, False Sneezeweeds, False Asters, New England Asters, White Panicled Asters, and Wild Mints.
