  "OVERVIEW": "The Arritola series is a member of the loamy, mixed, mesic, shallow Xerollic Durorthids.  Typically, Arritola soils have light brownish gray, medium textured A horizon and light brownish gray and yellowish brown moderately fine textured B2 horizon over indurated duripan at depths of 10 to 20 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually dry and dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice and are moist for 60 days or more following the winter solstice.  The solum is mildly to moderately alkaline throughout.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The profiles lack coarse fragments but some pedons have a desert pavement of pebbles ranging from 1/4 inch to 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has values of 6 or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.\nThe B horizon has hues of 7.5YR and 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe duripan usually has a weak root mat at the contact surface with some roots following fractures.  The top 1/2 inch of the duripan is mostly silica with carbonates increasing with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils are formed in lacustrine materials reworked by wind.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 11 inches and hot dry summers and cold winters.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 to 52 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F., and the mean winter temperature is 30 to 32 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days."
