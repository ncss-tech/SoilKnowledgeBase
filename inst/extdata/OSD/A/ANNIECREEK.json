  "OVERVIEW": "The Anniecreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic material. Anniecreek soils are on flood plains or low stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
