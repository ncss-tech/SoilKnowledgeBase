The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The volcanic ash and loess mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches in thickness. The particle- size control section averages 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. The soil is slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Some pedons are stony to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, or ashy very fine sandy loam, and the volume of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 25 percent. It has weak blocky or granular structure.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam, loam, or  sandy loam, and at depths below 40 inches, ranges to clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Volume of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 35 percent, and below 40 inches from 15 to 60 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon that has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, chroma of 2 or 4.

Centralpeak and Leadpoint soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Canteen soils are formed in granite residuum with a high content of quartz and feldspar minerals and are coarse sandy loam to loamy sand in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Moso soils are formed in granite, gneiss and schist with a high content of quartz and feldspar minerals and are very gravelly loamy coarse sand and very gravelly coarse sand in the lower part of the particle-size control section."

The soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash and loess over glacial till of mixed mineralogy, some areas formed in alluvium from glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  They are in a continental climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 35 inches and the growing season (28F) is 90 to 120 days."
