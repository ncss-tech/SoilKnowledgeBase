  "OVERVIEW": "The Ados series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a carbonate-cemented hardpan.  The soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone and dolostone.  Ados soils are on lower mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are from 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
