    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Affey soils are on fan remnants. They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,320 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
