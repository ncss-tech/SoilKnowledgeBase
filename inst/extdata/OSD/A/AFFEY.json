  "OVERVIEW": "The Affey series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Affey soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
