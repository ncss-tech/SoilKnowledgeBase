  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to the top of a lithologic discontinuity is greater than 30 inches. Rock fragments of sandstone, shale or siltstone make up 0 to 10 percent of the solum and 50 to 90 percent of the C horizon.  The soil is very strongly through moderately acid in the A and upper B horizons, and strongly acid through neutral in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap horizon is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon is silt loam or loam.\nThe Btg or BCtg horizon has hue or 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Subhorizons with dominant chroma of 3 are below depths of 30 inches.  Mottles are few to many, and have both high and low chroma.  The Btg horizon is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Black mineral concretions are present in many pedons in the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue or 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Subhorizons with dominant chroma of 3 are below depths of 30 inches.  Mottles are few to many, and have both high and low chroma.  The Bt horizon is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Black mineral concretions are present in many pedons in the Bt horizon. Some pedons may have a thin C or Cg horizon with similar textures and colors.\nThe 2C horizon is clay loam or silt loam that has rock controlled structure in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Maurertown, Pandora and Watchung series in the same family.  Maurertown soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Pandora soils have free carbonates at depths less than 70 inches and rounded rock fragments of glacial erratics.  Watchung soils have less than 20 percent by volume of rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.\nCroton and McGary series are in closely related families.  Croton soils have a fragipan.  McGary soils have a subhorizon within a depth of 30 inches in which the dominant chroma is 3 or more."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Albano soils are level and nearly level soils in small areas on upland flats and at the heads of drainageways.  Drainageways are subject to frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding events with little or no deposition or erosion. Slopes are mainly 0 to 2 percent, but they range from 0 to 7 percent.  Albano soils formed in local alluvium over residuum from siltstone, shale, argillite, sandstone of Triassic age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arcola, Bucks, Calverton, Manassas, and Panorama series.  The Arcola, Buck, Panoroma and Penn soils are well drained, have less clay in the B horizons, and have redder hues.  Calverton soils have fragipans.  Manassas soils have weakly expressed less clayey B horizons of redder hue."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Albano series includes that part of the soils formerly included in the Croton series that have a clay subsoil texture rather than a fragipan.\nChanged C and R horizons to a 2C and 2R to reflect the lithologic discontinuity that is present. (MAV 1/05)\n02/2005 added statement about frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding in the geographic setting.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 10 inches (A and BEg horizons)\n2.  Albic horizon-the zone from 2 to 10 inches (Eg horizon)\n3.  Argillic horizon-the zone from 10 to 39 inches (Btg and BCtg horizons)\n4.  Lithologic discontinuity at 39 inches (2C horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Chemical data available for representative pedon - V.P.I.
