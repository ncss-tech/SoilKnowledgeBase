    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Atasco series was formerly included in the Acadia, Woodville and Spurger series. The classification was changed during the update of MLRA 152Bs. Prior classifications included a glossic horizon and mixed mineralogy. Areas of these soils do not show evidence of clay stripping.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 36 to 86 cm (14 to 34 in). (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in). (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 36 to 203 cm (14 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg1, Btg2 horizons)\nVertic features: The presence of pressure faces and slickensides and clayey texture from 36 to 123 cm (14 to 49 in)  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nAdditional Comments: Gray, brown and yellow colors in the variegated matrix are due to wetness, which formed during wetter than normal conditions.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data available on pedon S12TX3391032.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
