  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the loamy-skeletal material ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  The solum ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid. The substratum is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Volume of gravel ranges from 15 to 60 percent in the A and B horizons and from 25 to 70 percent in the 2BC and 2C horizons. Volume of rock fragments greater than 3 inches ranges from 10 to 15 percent in the A and B horizons and from 10 to 35 percent in the 2BC and 2C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons have a lower Bw horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The 2Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is very gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sand, extremely gravelly sand, or coarse sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is extremely gravelly sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Closely related are the Alpena, Amasa, Colton, Elderon, Kiva, Newaygo, Oconto, Pence, Stambaugh, and Waiska soils.  Alpena, Kiva, and Newaygo soils have less acid sola and are underlain by sand and gravel containing free carbonates.  Amasa and Pence soils contain less rock fragments in the solum and have a spodic horizon.  Colton and Waiska soils contain less fines in the solum and have sandy-skeletal textures. Elderon soils have ochric epipedons.  Oconto soils have less than 35 percent by volume of rock fragments in the solum. Stambaugh soils do not have rock fragments in the solum and have argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Allouez soils are on kame terraces old beach ridges and valley trains.  Slope gradients are typically 0 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in 15 to 24 inches of loamy-skeletal outwash overlying sand and gravel outwash.  Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches."

Champion and Munising soils have formed in glacial till.  Kalkaska soils formed in sandy outwash and have less than 15 percent coarse fragments."
