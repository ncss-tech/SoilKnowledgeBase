  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Airstrip soils are on strongly convex ridge tops, spur ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 67 to 1032 meters (500 to 3385 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1780to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 200 to 280 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series type location was moved in 2004 to better reflect the series concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 67 centimeters (A horizon)\n2. Lithic contact - the bedrock interface at 67 centimeters depth\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 67 centimeters, averages 14 percent clay, by field estimate, and 36 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.60\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil samples 83-RNP-9 and 86-RNP-8 were collected from a similar pedon and analyzed chemically at the Oregon State University Soil Testing. Laboratory (lab numbers 71712-71714, 82918 and 82919). Bulk density and moisture retention were determined at Humboldt State\nUniversity.\nNASIS User Pedon ID 02CA605REDW060\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
