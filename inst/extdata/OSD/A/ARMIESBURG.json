  "OVERVIEW": "The Armiesburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and flood plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
