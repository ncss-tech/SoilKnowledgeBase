Battleground, Bismarckgrove, and Omadi soils have carbonates present within the series control section. Dozaville soils average less than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Dungan soils formed in areas where the difference between the average winter and summer soil temperature is less than 9 degrees C."
