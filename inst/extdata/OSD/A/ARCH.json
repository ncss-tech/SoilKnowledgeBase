Grasses include sideoats and blue gramas, buffalograss, western wheatgrass, alkali sacaton, vine-mesquite, and small amounts of switchgrass. Other species include prairieclover, sensitivebrier, wild alfalfa, daleas, fourwing saltbush, and cholla. This soil has been correlated to the High Lime (R077CY026TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The type location and classification were changed to better reflect the manner in which Arch soils have been mapped in the past. The Arch series was previously classified as a fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Ustochreptic Calciorthid.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in). (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in). (Bk, Bkk1, Bkk2 horizons)\nCarbonate plugged horizon (kk): 41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) (Bkk horizons)\nNote: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data on pedon S95TX-445-027 from Terry County TX.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
