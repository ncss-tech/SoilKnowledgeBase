  "OVERVIEW": "The Abbyville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium on terraces and high flood plains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",
