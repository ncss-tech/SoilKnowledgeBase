  "OVERVIEW": "The Abilene series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or outwash. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on terraces on dissected plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
