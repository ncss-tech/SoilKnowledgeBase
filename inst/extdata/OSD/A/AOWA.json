  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness is 20 inches or less, and is the same as the thickness of the A1 or Ap horizon. Stratification occurs within 10 inches of the surface.  Aowa soils are calcareous throughout, and are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon after mixing has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon is stratified with light and dark colored strata.  The C horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and 3 through 5 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.  It typically is silt loam; however, strata of silty clay loam or loam are present in some pedons.  The control section typically averages between 20 and 28 percent clay.  Dark brown silt loam or silty clay loam buried soils are below depths of 24 inches in some pedons.  Few to common yellowish brown, brown, or strong brown mottles are present on the faces of stratification planes in some pedons.  The lower part of the C horizon contains thin strata of fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, loam, or silty clay in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in this family.  Other closely related soils are the Dorchester, Haynie, Hobbs, McPaul, and Nodaway series.  Dorchester soils have a wetter climate.  Haynie and McPaul soils are coarse-silty.  Hobbs and Nodaway soils lack free carbonates within a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aowa soils typically are on occasionally or frequently flooded drainageways or narrow flood plains of tributary streams.  These soils have slope gradients ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  Aowa soils formed in light and dark colored stratified calcareous alluvium from soils formed in the adjacent loess uplands.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F."
