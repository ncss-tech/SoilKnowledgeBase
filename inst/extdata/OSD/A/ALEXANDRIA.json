  "OVERVIEW": "The Alexandria series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. These soils formed in loamy till of medium lime content on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
