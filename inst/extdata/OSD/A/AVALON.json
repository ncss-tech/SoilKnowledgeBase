The former type location in Utah was reclassified to coarse-loamy.\nThe responsibility for the Avalon series was transferred from MO8 (Phoenix) to MO6 (Lakewood) in 1997.\nActivity class was estimated based on lab data in the survey area.\nLast updated by the state: 7/98.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
