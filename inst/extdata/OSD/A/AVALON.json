  "OVERVIEW": "The Avalon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly and moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, dissected fans, and hills  and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 8 inches.",

The former type location in Utah was reclassified to coarse-loamy.\nThe responsibility for the Avalon series was transferred from MO8 (Phoenix) to MO6 (Lakewood) in 1997.\nActivity class was estimated based on lab data in the survey area.\nLast updated by the state: 7/98.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
