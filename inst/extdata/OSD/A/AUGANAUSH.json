    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 1 to 10 percent by volume of the profile.  The linear extensibility (LE) from the mineral soil surface to 100 cm is less than 6 cm but averages about 5.6 centimeters.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon that includes chroma of 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has high chroma redoximorphic features.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  When tilled, the E horizon may be completely incorporated within the plow layer.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It has faint to prominent clay films on the faces of peds.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe Btkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  It has faint to prominent clay films on faces of peds or in old root channels.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkg or BCkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Some pedons have a Cg horizon."

These soils formed in loamy to clayey calcareous glacial till and water modified glacial till of Late Wisconsin Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 100 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1050 to 1650 feet."

Naytahwaush soils have higher chroma in the argillic horizon and are well drained. Mahkonce soils have higher chroma in the matrix or ped coatings and/or lack Fe depletions in the argillic horizon.  The Naytahwaush and Mahkonce soils are on convex higher lying landscapes.  Cathro, Hamre, Lupton and Seelyeville soils are very poorly drained soils in depressions."

Representative values for textures and clay content were used for correlation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES Central File Code number 4328 for lab results of the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
