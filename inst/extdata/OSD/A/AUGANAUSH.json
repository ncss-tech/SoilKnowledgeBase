  "OVERVIEW": "The Auganaush series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in glacial till and water modified clayey calcareous glacial till on moraines.  The permeability is moderately slow or slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The linear extensibility (LE) from the mineral soil surface to 100 cm is less than 6 cm but averages about 5.6 centimeters.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon that includes chroma of 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has high chroma redoximorphic features.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  When tilled, the E horizon may be completely incorporated within the plow layer.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It has faint to prominent clay films on the faces of peds.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe Btkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  It has faint to prominent clay films on faces of peds or in old root channels.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkg or BCkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.

The Naytahwaush and Mahkonce soils are on convex higher lying landscapes.  Cathro, Hamre, Lupton and Seelyeville soils are very poorly drained soils in depressions."

Representative values for textures and clay content were used for correlation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES Central File Code number 4328 for lab results of the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
