The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 2 inches. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 2 to about 28 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 28 to about 57 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 2 to 22 inches (Bt, Btk1, and part of Btk2 horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the coarse silt or very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data from adjacent soils indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  It is estimated that Alire soils have similar values and thus lack the properties of the andic intergrades.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location has been sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S95NM-049-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
