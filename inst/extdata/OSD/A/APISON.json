  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The bedrock is commonly soft shale but in some pedons the soft shale is interbedded with thin layers of siltstone or fine-grain sandstone or both.  The bedrock gradually gets harder with depth but hard bedrock is below 60 inches from the surface in most pedons.  Rock fragments ranging from 1/4 inch to 2 inches across range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the solum and 20 to 65 percent in the C horizon where present.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have a thin A1 horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have few to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red in the lower part.  Some pedons have thin transitional horizons above and below the Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have a C horizon from 2 to 8 inches thick.  Colors and textures are like those in the lower part of the Bt horizon except they also include gray lithochromic mottles."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Biffle, Cahaba, Durham, Granville, Pirum, Stringtown, and Suffolk series in the same family.  Additionally, series that were formerly in the same family, but have not been reclassified to 8th edition standards include Euharlee, Hartsells, Linker, Nauvoo, Octaha, Olla, Sipsey and Spadra.  Cahaba, Durham, Euharlee, Granville, Olla, Spadra and Suffolk series are all deeper than 60 inches to a paralithic or lithic contact.  Biffle soils have soft cherty limestone within 40 inches of the surface.  Hartsells and Linker soils have hard sandstone within 40 inches of the surface. Pirum soils have a lithic contact within 50 inches.  Nauvoo soils have paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.  Octaha soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface and a moisture deficit of more than two.  Sipsey soils have a lower silt content in the Bt horizon.\nSeries in closely related families are the Emporia, Kempsville, and Smithdale, which all are in subactive families.  All of these soils formed in coastal plain sediments and are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock.\nThe Jefferson, Lily, and Lonewood series are also in closely related familes and have mesic temperature regimes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Apison soils are on the sides and tops of low rolling hills.  Slopes range from about 2 to 75 percent.  The soil formed in residuum from interbedded shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone or in a layer of colluvium and residuum.  Near the type location mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches."

Armuchee, Enders, and Townley soils are commonly on steeper slopes of adjacent uplands, are well drained, and have clayey subsoils.  Leadvale soils are on benches and footslopes.  They are moderately well drained and have a fragipan.  Hamblen soils are on bottomlands and are moderately well drained."
