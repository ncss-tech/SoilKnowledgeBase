  "OVERVIEW": "The Aurand series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in loamy glaciolacustrine material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and the underlying till. They are on lake plains and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
