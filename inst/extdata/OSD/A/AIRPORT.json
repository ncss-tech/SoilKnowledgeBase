  "OVERVIEW": "The Airport series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, sandstone, shale and quartzite.  Airport soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 19 inches (A and Btkn horizons).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 6 to 19 inches (Btkn horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 6 to 40 inches (Btkn, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 19 and 40 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 6 to 19 inches (Btkn horizon).\nIn August 1994 the classification was changed from Typic Natraquoll to Aquic Natrixerolls.  The 5Y hue and 2 chroma matrix in the 19 to 32 inch layer was interpreted to be redox depletions for placement in the Aquic subgroup.\nThe Davis-Weber soil survey area (UT607) includes a component that is a \"shallow water table phase\" and has ponding.\nIn the Box Elder County, Eastern Part soil survey area Airport is described as moderately well drained and the taxonomic unit classifies as a Typic Natrixeroll.  These soils will be correlated to the Fridlo series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 136-137, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
