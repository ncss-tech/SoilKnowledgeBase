  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick. Free carbonates are at depths of 9 to 20 inches. Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 1 to 4 percent, by volume, of the profile. The particle size control section has 10 to 20 percent sand, 35 to 50 percent silt, and 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 in the upper part and 1 or 2 in the lower part. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is neutral or slightly alkaline but has no free carbonates.\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 20 to 35 percent. Some pedons have a Bw horizon with a hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4 above the Bkss horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 25 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on convex and linear slopes on glacial moraines. Slope gradient ranges from 1 to 40 percent. The soils formed in calcareous glacial till of Late Wisconsin Age. Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. Frost free days range from 90 to 130 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dovray, Foxlake, Hattie and Boyerlake soils. The moderately well drained Boyerlake soils do not have mollic epipedons. The moderately well drained Hattie soils are calcareous throughout.  The very poorly drained Dovray soils are in depressions. The poorly drained Foxlake soils are on low-lying nearly level to concave swales and toeslopes."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff ranges from slow to rapid. Permeability is slow.  Soil saturation (perched water table) occurs as high as depths of 3 feet at some time from October to June in most years."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features identified in this soil are: Mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and A horizons); calcic horizon--the zone from 14 to 36 inches; frigid soil temperature. The presence of some slickensides described in pits is the basis for the taxonomic class. 1/12/2011-TYPE LOCATION error corrected.\nThese soils are not classic vertisols but this seems to be the best class for them at this time.\nADDITIONAL DATA: For laboratory data see Minn. Ag. Exp. Station CFC No. 4700.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
