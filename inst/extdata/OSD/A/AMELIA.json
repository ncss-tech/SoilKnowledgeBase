    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and slightly acid or neutral in the Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly clay.  Content of pebbles and cobbles  range from 2 to 20 percent, by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture in the upper Bt is very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay, gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay and in the lower Bt, clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 20 to 75 percent by volume, averaging 40 to 70 percent in the control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Descalabrado, Fraternidad, Guayama, Jacana, and Maguayo series.  Descalabrado and Guayama soils are shallow to igneous bedrock.  Jacana soils are moderately deep to igneous bedrock.  In addition, they are on higher adjacent sideslopes of volcanic hills and mountains and have fewer pebbles and cobbles in the control section.  The moderately well drained Fraternidad soils have smectitic mineralogy and fewer pebbles in the control section.  Maguayo soils are on similar positions, contain secondary carbonates, and have fewer pebbles in the control section."
