  "OVERVIEW": "The Amelia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on mountain footslopes and alluvial fans.  They formed in gravelly sediments that weathered  from igneous rock.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",

Jacana soils are moderately deep to igneous bedrock.  In addition, they are on higher adjacent sideslopes of volcanic hills and mountains and have fewer pebbles and cobbles in the control section.  The moderately well drained Fraternidad soils have smectitic mineralogy and fewer pebbles in the control section.  Maguayo soils are on similar positions, contain secondary carbonates, and have fewer pebbles in the control section."
