    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons an features recognized in this pedon are:\nAlbic horizon: the zone from 6 to 14 inches. (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon: the zone from 21 to 30 inches. (Bt horizon)\nLithic contact: granite bedrock at 30 inches.\nThe vegetation statement was revised on October 2007 to reflect the vegetation at the type location.  Prior to 2007 the statement was lodgepole pine, spruce, and a sparse understory of grasses and sedges.  On southerly aspects, ponderosa pine\nThe typical pedon location was updated in 07/2007 to be consistent with the location as given in the Boulder County Area soil survey. This location conflicts with the original OSD location (NW1/4 NW1/4 Sec. 35, T. 2 N., R. 71 W.) It is believed that the Boulder soil survey location is correct.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
