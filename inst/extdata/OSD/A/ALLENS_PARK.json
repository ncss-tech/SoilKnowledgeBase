  "OVERVIEW": "The Allens Park series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in parent sediments weathered in place from underlying granitic or sandstone bedrock.  Allens Park soils are on mountain slopes, hills, and ridges.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",

(Bt horizon)\nLithic contact: granite bedrock at 30 inches.\nThe vegetation statement was revised on October 2007 to reflect the vegetation at the type location.  Prior to 2007 the statement was lodgepole pine, spruce, and a sparse understory of grasses and sedges.  On southerly aspects, ponderosa pine\nThe typical pedon location was updated in 07/2007 to be consistent with the location as given in the Boulder County Area soil survey. This location conflicts with the original OSD location (NW1/4 NW1/4 Sec. 35, T. 2 N., R. 71 W.) It is believed that the Boulder soil survey location is correct.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
