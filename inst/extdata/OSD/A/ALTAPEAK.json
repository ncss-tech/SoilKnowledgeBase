    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F. Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches. The solum and upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air-dried samples. Rock fragments, including hard cinders in the control section, average 35 to 70 percent. Bedrock is granitic rock, or low grade metamorphic rock including slate and phyllite. Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 14 to 25 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry. There is tonguing of this horizon into the B horizon in some pedons. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR moist and 5YR or 7.5YR dry, values are 2 through 5 moist and 4 or 5 dry, chroma is 4 through 8 moist and 4 through 6 dry. There is up to 15 percent black organic staining up to 2mm in diameter in some pedons. Texture is ashy sandy loam or ashy loam modified by 15 to 45 percent coarse fragments including hard cinders. Structure is weakly to strongly expressed. There are two distinct Bhs horizons in some pedons. In pedons where there are two distinct Bhs horizons, the structure in the upper horizon is strong subangular or angular blocky.\nThe Bs horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It is very gravelly ashy loamy sand or very gravelly ashy sandy loam. It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry. The fine earth fraction is loamy sand, coarse sand or loamy coarse sand. Coarse fragments are angular and residual in origin and range from 45 to 75 percent by volume. The horizon is massive exhibiting some rock structure. Some pedons have weak, fine subangular blocky structure or single grain. It is slightly acid to strongly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Index, Serene and Skipeak series. Serene soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact. Skipeak soils do not have a Bhs horizon, and have mixed rounded rock fragments of mixed lithology in the particle-size control section. Index soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 42 to 46 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Altapeak soils are on mountain slopes at 3,200 to 5,600 feet in elevation. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent. Altapeak soils formed in a thin mantle of volcanic ash and cinders over residuum and colluvium from granitic and low grade metamorphic rocks including slate and phyllite. The climate is maritime influenced with cold, wet winters, and cool, moist summers. The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. Annual precipitation is 70 to 130 inches, with a considerable portion of this being in the form of snow. Frost-free season is 50 to 80 days."

Nagrom, Haywire, Nimue, Playco, and Shuksan soils are loamy-skeletal. Shuksan soils have a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 20 to 40 inches. Haywire, Klapatche, and Nagrom soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Reggad soils are fragmental and lack a spodic horizon. Spukwash soils are ashy over-loamy horizon."
