  "OVERVIEW": "The Altapeak series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with residuum and colluvium from granitic and metamorphic rocks. Altapeak soils are on mountain slopes at 3,200 to 5,600 feet. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 100 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Rock fragments, including hard cinders in the control section, average 35 to 70 percent. Bedrock is granitic rock, or low grade metamorphic rock including slate and phyllite. Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 14 to 25 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry. There is tonguing of this horizon into the B horizon in some pedons. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR moist and 5YR or 7.5YR dry, values are 2 through 5 moist and 4 or 5 dry, chroma is 4 through 8 moist and 4 through 6 dry. There is up to 15 percent black organic staining up to 2mm in diameter in some pedons. Texture is ashy sandy loam or ashy loam modified by 15 to 45 percent coarse fragments including hard cinders. Structure is weakly to strongly expressed. There are two distinct Bhs horizons in some pedons. In pedons where there are two distinct Bhs horizons, the structure in the upper horizon is strong subangular or angular blocky.\nThe Bs horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It is very gravelly ashy loamy sand or very gravelly ashy sandy loam. It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry. The fine earth fraction is loamy sand, coarse sand or loamy coarse sand. Coarse fragments are angular and residual in origin and range from 45 to 75 percent by volume.

Altapeak soils formed in a thin mantle of volcanic ash and cinders over residuum and colluvium from granitic and low grade metamorphic rocks including slate and phyllite. The climate is maritime influenced with cold, wet winters, and cool, moist summers. The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. Annual precipitation is 70 to 130 inches, with a considerable portion of this being in the form of snow. Frost-free season is 50 to 80 days."

Haywire, Klapatche, and Nagrom soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Reggad soils are fragmental and lack a spodic horizon. Spukwash soils are ashy over-loamy horizon."
