  "OVERVIEW": "The Arbus series consists of very deep somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium dominantly from limestone.  They are on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  Arbus soils have slopes of 1 to 6 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
