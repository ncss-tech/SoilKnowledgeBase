  "OVERVIEW": "The Agnos series consists of deep, well drained, very slow permeability soils that formed in residuum weathered from cherty dolomite.  These nearly level to steep soils are on uplands of the Salem Plateau of the Ozark Highlands, MLRA 116A.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
