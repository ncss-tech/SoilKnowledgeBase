    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The A horizon and E horizon are very strongly acid to slightly acid unless limed.  The upper part of the B horizon is moderately acid to very strongly acid and the lower part of the B horizon and C horizon is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B/E or E/B horizon has properties like the E and the Bt horizons except the chroma of the Bt part ranges from 3 to 8.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay in the upper part and ranges to silty clay loam in the lower part.  Clay content averages between 40 and 60 percent.  There are common to many redox features with value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 8.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam."

The poorly drained Moniteau and Racoon soils do not have abrupt textural changes between their A and B horizons and have fine-silty argillic horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained Westerville and Belknap, and the well and moderately well drained Sharon soils do not have argillic horizons.  All of the associated soils are on stream terrace or flood plain positions and have less clay in the series control section."
