  "OVERVIEW": "The Amasa series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in loamy materials underlain by sandy materials on outwash plains, stream terraces, kames, eskers, and moraines. Permeability is moderate in the loamy materials and rapid or very rapid in the underlying sandy material.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum typically is 15 to 30 inches.  The solum ranges from extremely acid to medium acid and the 2C horizon is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the 2C horizons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout the pedon.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the solum and from 0 to 5 percent in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 or 1.  The A horizon, when present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The B horizons are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs of these textures.  Some pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Textures of the BC horizon are similar to those of the B horizons.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are sand and coarse sand or gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs of these textures."

Allagash and Monadnock soils are in areas of higher precipitation and longer growing seasons.  Duxbury soils are in areas of high precipitation, and typically have less rock fragments greater than 3 inches in the solum. Allard soils are coarse-silty over sandy and are mesic.  Champion soils have fragipans and loamy sand underlying material.  Channing and Machias soils have chroma of 2 or less with mottles between depths of 6 inches below the base of the spodic horizon and 40 inches.  Gogebic, Goodman, and Padus soils have thicker sola.  In addition, Gogebic soils have fragipans, argillic horizons and sandy loam C horizons; and the Padus and Stambaugh soils have argillic horizons.  Pence soils have thinner and coarser sola containing less fine sand, very fine sand, and silt."
