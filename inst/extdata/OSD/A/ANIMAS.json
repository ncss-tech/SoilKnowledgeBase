  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Animas series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils formed in material weathered from igneous rock deposited over clayey shale. Animas soils are on hummock.  Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.  Typically, Animas soils have dark gray and dark grayish brown A1 horizons, gravelly sandy loam B2t horizons, and strongly mottled C1g horizons overlying shale at 38 inches.",
