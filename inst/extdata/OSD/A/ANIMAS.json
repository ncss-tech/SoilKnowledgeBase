  "OVERVIEW": "The Animas series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils formed in material weathered from igneous rock deposited over clayey shale. Animas soils are on hummocks.  Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,000 to 1,100 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
