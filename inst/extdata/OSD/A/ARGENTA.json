    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,100 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of May 2003 updates the taxonomic class from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Halaquepts.  Future study is needed to determine the amount of volcanic glass in this series and whether the taxonomic class should be changed to Ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Aquandic Halaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nDurinodes - The zone from 18 to 114 cm (Bq, Bqk1, and Bqk2 horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 30 to 114 cm (Bqk1 and Bqk2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 80 and 100 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bqk2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bqk1 horizon and parts of the Bq and Bqk2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous editors and authors include: ELS-MJZ-RLB.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
