Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 63 to 66 degrees F (17 to 19 degrees C) The soils usually are dry about June 15 and remain dry until September 15. Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 25 percent rounded cobbles, 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel, and 0 to 2 percent stones.  Cracks 1/4 to 2 inches wide extend from the surface to the duripan from July through October.  The surface commonly has hoof prints up to 6 inches (15 cm) or more deep.  A fluctuating, perched water table occurs at depths of 0 to 20 inches (0 to 51 cm) or the duripan, from November through mid April and is dependent on storm frequency and duration.\nSome pedons are underlain by sandstone or volcanic sediments with a discontinous silica cemented capping.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2; 7.5YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2, 6/2; 5YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, or 4/2.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Anita soils occur in shallow depressions, basins, and along narrow stringers along drainageways on older terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They are underlain by indurated duripan which generally rest on sediments derived from tuffaceous rocks.  Elevations are about 145 to 1,500 feet (44 to 457 m) and the climate is subhumid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 20 to 40 inches (508 to 1016 mm), and with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 60 to 64 degrees F (16 to 18 degrees C), average January temperature is about 40 degrees F (4 degrees C), and average July temperature about 81 degrees F (27 degrees C).  The growing season is 200 to 280 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Anita series was formerly classified as a Grumusol. Data added in 1969: moderately well drained, elevation increased to 1500 feet, and hardpan generally rest on sediments derived from tuffaceous rocks.   Reclassified from Durochrepts to Typic Durixerepts in 1998.\n7/2004- Propose to reclassified to Xeric Duraquerts, change drainage to poorly; change depth from 12 to 30 to 12 to 20 inches; added watertable and ponding data, in the ROC added A horizon dry color 10YR 5/2, 7.5YR 5/2, 6/2, clay content, rock fragments, redox features, Changed A3 and A4 to Bss horizons, to dry colors added 5YR 5/1, 10YR 5/2 and moist color 7.5YR 4/3. added CBV-C, rock fragments and redox features, added surface rock fragments and surface features, added reference to lab data, slickensides and cracks, and added vegetation data.\nSoils with a Duripan at a depths greater than 20 inches (51 cm) will now be outside of the range for the series. Used in the following counties; Shasta, Tehama, Butte, Lake, Santa Barbara, and Siskiyou counties.  Usage in these counties will require further review.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLab data from 58-52-42, Department of Soils, University of California Berkley 5/18/1960\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
