  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. RER; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "12/2003",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Aguadilla series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils along the coast just above sea level.  They formed in sandy sediments derived from volcanic rock and mollusk shells.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

The average annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 85 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F."

Catano soils are on adjacent beaches and are calcareous throughout.  The somewhat poorly drained Coloso soils are on adjacent flood plains and have very-fine, kaolinitic control sections."
