The average annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 85 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F."

Catano soils are on adjacent beaches and are calcareous throughout.  The somewhat poorly drained Coloso soils are on adjacent flood plains and have very-fine, kaolinitic control sections."
