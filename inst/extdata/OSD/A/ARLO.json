  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sand and gravel ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 30 inches thick. The soil typically is calcareous throughout, but some pedons in native grass lack free carbonates to a depth of 6 inches.  The calcic horizon has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 40 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral; value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry; and chroma of 0 to 1.  Typically it is loam or clay loam but is silt loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ak horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry; and chroma of 0 to 1.  Some pedons have chroma of 2 and distinct or prominent mottles are present.  Typically, it is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has common to many distinct and prominent mottles.  Typically, it is stratified loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, but is sandy loam or gravelly clay loam in the lower part of some pedons.  Few or common nests of gypsum and other salts are in some pedons.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color and texture of the Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 to 4.  Typically, it is stratified gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand, sand, or loamy sand, but thin layers of contrasting material are present in some pedons.  It contains up to 50 percent gravel.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arlo soils are level or nearly level on broad drainageways and flats on glacial outwash plains and flood plains.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent, and surfaces are plane or slightly concave.  They formed in loamy alluvium overlying stratified sand and gravel.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delmont, Dimo, Enet and Storla soils.  Delmont, Dimo, and Enet soils do not have a calcic horizon and are on higher parts of the landscape. In addition, the Delmont soils have sand and gravel at depths of 10 to 20 inches. Storla soils are better drained and have higher chroma below the mollic epipedon and are on slightly higher parts of the landscape."
