  "OVERVIEW": "The Aldine series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils.  These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age of the Lissie Formation.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1219 mm (48 in).",
