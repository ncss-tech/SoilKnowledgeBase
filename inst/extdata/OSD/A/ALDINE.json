During the update of MLRA 152B, the Aldine soils were restricted to pimple mounds.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in)\nGlossic horizon: 25 to 48 cm (10 to 19 in)\nArgillic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil survey office lab data is availbale from the type location.  Kellogg Soil Survey Lab data available on pedon S12TX1993304 (lab pedon number is 12N8313).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
