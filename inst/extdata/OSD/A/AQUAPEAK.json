    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aquapeak soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid or mixed igneous rocks. Elevations range from 458 to 750 meters (1,500 to 2,460 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Buzzardsprings, Carpetflat and Coxpin soils are on similar landscape positions, Dalelake soils are on adjacent sandsheets, and Pintobasin soils are on adjacent fan aprons. Buzzardsprings, Carpetflat and Coxpin soils do not have an argillic horizon. In addition, Buzzardsprings soils do not have a duripan while Coxpin soils are 36 to 50 centimeters deep to a duripan. Dalelake and Pintobasin soils are very deep, are sandy throughout the particle-size control section and have no diagnostic horizons."
