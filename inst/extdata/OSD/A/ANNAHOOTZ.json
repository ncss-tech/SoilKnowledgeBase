  "OVERVIEW": "The Annahootz series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed from partially decomposed forest litter overlying fragmental stones and boulders.  Annahootz soils are on footslopes and benches at the base of backslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is in excess of 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fragmental material ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  The organic materials consist of moderately to well decomposed leaves, twigs, and needles.  Coarse fragment content in the lower layers ranges from 85 to 95 percent and is dominantly stones and boulders.  The interstices of the fragmental material are partly filled with well decomposed forest litter.  The soil is not frozen in most years due to maritime influence.  pH is less than 5.0 (1:1,H2O) in the organic layers."

Sokolof soils have only gravel and cobble size coarse fragments.   Tebenkof soils have mineral horizons above the fragmental material."

These soils formed from forest litter overlying and mixed with colluvial stones and boulders.  The climate is humid maritime with a mean annual precipitation range of 60 to 220 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 1500 feet."

Passage, Kupreanof, and Sitka soils are on similar topographic positions but are mineral soils and lack boulders throughout the profile.  Tolstoi, Traitors, and Verstovia soils are shallow to bedrock, mineral soils on steep backslopes."
