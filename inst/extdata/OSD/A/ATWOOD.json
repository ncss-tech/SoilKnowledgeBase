  "OVERVIEW": "The Atwood series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a mantle of silty material and the underlying loamy sediments of marine origin. Atwood soils are on hills of the Southern Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 17 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 142 to 147 centimeters (56 to 58 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
