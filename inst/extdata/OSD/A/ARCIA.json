  "OVERVIEW": "The Arcia series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite, conglomerate, welded tuff, rhyolite, or basalt. Arcia soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Elevations range from 1,600 meters to 2,550 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4.5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

The series place of origin and most acres are MLRA 25. The areas mapped in MLRA 10 in central OR need to be reevaluated for consistency with this concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 53 cm (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 36 to 99 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nVitritorandic feature - Volcanic glass is estimated to be 20 to 50 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from 0 to 36 cm (A horizon) and 5 to 25 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from 36 to 53 cm (Bt1 horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 99 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 36 to 86 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)."
