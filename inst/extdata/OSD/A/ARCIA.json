  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arcia soils are on hills and mountains. They typically occur on concave footslope and backslope positions. These soils formed in thin deposits of loess and volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite, conglomerate, welded tuff, rhyolite, or basalt. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,600 meters to 2,550 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4.5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

Tusel and Hackwood soils are more than 100 cm deep to bedrock, average less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have a cryic temperature regime."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: December, 2008 revision changes the classification from Pachic Argixerolls to Vitrandic Argixerolls to account for volcanic glass in the upper part, estimated based on benchmark data from the MLRA 25 area. The series place of origin and most acres are MLRA 25. The areas mapped in MLRA 10 in central OR need to be reevaluated for consistency with this concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 53 cm (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 36 to 99 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nVitritorandic feature - Volcanic glass is estimated to be 20 to 50 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from 0 to 36 cm (A horizon) and 5 to 25 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from 36 to 53 cm (Bt1 horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 99 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 36 to 86 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include: DWW-PWB-TM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
