In addition, Arecibo soils are on similar positions and are more than 50 inches in depth to the spodic horizon, Carrizales soils are on higher positions and are sandy throughout, and Guerrero soils are on higher positions, have clayey control sections, and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The moderately well drained Jobos soils are on higher positions, have clayey control sections, are plinthic, and have sandy surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches in thickness."
