  "OVERVIEW": "The Albarrobo series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on coastal plains.  They formed in sands underlain by clayey sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",
