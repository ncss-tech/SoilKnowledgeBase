  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Alibates series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from the upper part of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits of interfluves and broad erosion remnants.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 in).",
