  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 4 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  These soils are usually mottled in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and throughout the control section.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is usually light clay loam or heavy loam and ranges in clay from 18 to 35 percent.  Limestone flagstones on the soil surface range from 5 to 20 percent.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 15 to 35 percent by volume and are predominantly flagstones.  Bulk calcium carbonate equivalent is high, due to limestone fragments, but is less than 40 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 5.5 dry, 2 through 3.5 moist, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Usually the horizon has granular or crumb structure in the upper part but is subangular blocky in the lower part.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.  The horizon is usually distinctly mottled in the lower part.\nThe B2g horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The horizon is distinctly mottled and has base colors with chroma of 2 or less.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and is usually distinctly mottled.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Almont soils are in basins and depressions above timber line or in seepage areas on slopes above timber line.  Slope gradients range from 0 to as much as 30 or more percent in some areas.  They formed in moderately fine textured parent materials weathered from platy shales and limestones.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches.  The average annual temperature is 28 degrees F.  There is no frost-free period."
