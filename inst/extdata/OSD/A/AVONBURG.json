  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Avonburg soils are on summits of loess-covered till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. They formed in 152 to 229 cm (60 to 90 inches) of loess and the underlying paleosol in Illinoian till. The upper 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess averages about 15 percent sand, and the lower loess averages about 24 percent. This lower loess has been called \"gritty loess\". Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 160 to 200 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

In undisturbed areas, depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) in normal years. In drained areas, the depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) in normal years. Potential for surface water runoff is medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper part of the solum and low to moderately high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Avonburg soils have previously been considered to be formed in 51 to 122 cm (20 to 48 inches) of loess and the underlying loam or clay loam till. Recent investigations and descriptions show a paleosol formed in till begins between a depth of 152 to 229 cm (60 and 90 inches). In 1995, the Type Location was moved to Scott County to more typically represent the Avonburg series.\nAn undrained phase is recognized.\nSoil Survey Investigations Report No. 41 gives information on the origin of the gritty loess in the Avonburg and geographically associated soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surfact to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 53 to 203 cm (21 to 80 inches) (Btg, 2Btgx/Eg, and 2Btx horizons).\nFragic soil properties: from a depth of 94 to 211 cm (37 to 83 inches) (2Btgx/Eg and 2Btx horizons).\nGlossic horizon: from a depth of 94 to 132 cm (37 to 52 inches) (2Btgx/Eg horizon).\nRedoximorphic features: present in all horizon below a depth of 28 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon, S1986IN143005, from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University are also available from KSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
