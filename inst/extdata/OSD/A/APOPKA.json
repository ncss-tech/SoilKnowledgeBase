    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid except where the surface has been limed. Plinthite ranges from 0 to 5 percent, by volume, in the Bt horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Fine to medium pockets of uncoated sand grains in shades of gray or white range from none to common.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, red, or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand and contains less than 5 percent silt plus clay.\nThe EB horizon, where present, is less than 12 inches in thickness.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have a few discontinuous lamellae up to 3mm in thickness. Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, red, or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has colors similar to the upper part or there is no dominant color and it is multicolored in shades of red, brown, and yellow.  Gray and white stripped sand grains between peds range from none to common.  Texture is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon. It has colors similar to the lower Bt horizon with gray and white stripped sand grains between peds that range from few to many.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam."

The somewhat poorly drained Adamsville are on lower positions and are sandy throughout.  Arredondo soils are on similar to lower positions, have yellower subsoils, and have 5 to 15 percent silt plus clay in the E horizons.  The excessively well drained Astatula, Candler, and Lake soils are on similar to higher positions and are sandy throughout. The well drained Fort Meade soils are on slightly higher positions, have thick dark surfaces, are sandy throughout and have a seasonal high water table more than 88 inches below the surface. The poorly drained Immokalee and Myakka soils are on similar positions and have spodic horizons. Kendrick soils are on similar positions and have surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The moderately well drained Millhopper soils are on lower positions.  The somewhat poorly drained Sparr soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The moderately well drained Tavares soils are on lower positions and are sandy throughout."
