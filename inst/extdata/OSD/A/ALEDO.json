  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  Limestone fragments range from 5 to about 50 percent in the A1 horizon and from 40 to 85 percent in the A2 horizon.  The control section has from 35 to 65 percent limestone fragments.  The fragments are mainly less than 6 inches across, however, some pedons contain a few fragments up to 18 inches across. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 80 percent.  Secondary carbonates as films, threads and soft masses, and pendants on the undersides of fragments range from 5 to 25 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has colors in hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture is clay loam, loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly counterparts.\nThe underlying material is limestone bedrock that is interbedded with marly or clayey materials at vertical intervals of 3 to about 10 inches.   The bedrock is coarsely fractured with fractures about 4 to 10 inches apart.  Typically, it can be excavated with a backhoe machine."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ector, Lueders and Oplin in the same family and the similar Eckert, Eckrant, Eddy, Real and Tarrant series.  Ector, Lueders and Oplin soils are in drier climates.  In addition, Lueders has developed in Permian limestones.  Eckert soils have mixed mineralogy and formed in residuum of dolomitic limestone.  Eckrant and Tarrant soils have clayey skeletal control sections and Tarrant soils are in drier climates.  Eddy soils lack a mollic epipedon and formed in residuum of the Austin chalk.  Real soils are underlain by limestone that has hardness of less than 3 on the Moh's scale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aledo soils are on convex shallow uplands.  Slopes are mainly 3 to 8 percent, but range from 1 to 40 percent.  The slopes of 8 to 40 percent are mostly narrow bands or steep breaks within less sloping areas.  The soils formed in interbedded limestones and marls, mainly of Cretaceous age.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 36 inches and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 44 to 58."

Maloterre soils lack mollic epipedons and contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Purves soils are clayey and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments."
