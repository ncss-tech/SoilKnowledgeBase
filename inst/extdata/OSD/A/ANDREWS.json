  "OVERVIEW": "The Andrews series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from limestone on rounded hills and ridges of the uplands.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about l8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
