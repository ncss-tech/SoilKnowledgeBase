  "REVDATE": "03/2003",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Azeltine series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly and cobbly alluvium from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Azeltine soils are on terraces, benches and fans adjacent to major drainage ways and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 6 to 14 inches.  These soils are typically calcareous throughout, but are leached to a depth of 6 to 14 inches in some pedons.  The upper part of the control section is typically gravelly sandy loam or gravelly light sandy clay loam and ranges in clay from 18 to 25 percent.  Depth to the contrasting IIC2ca horizon is 16 to 34 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Gravel ranges from 15 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  Gravel ranges from 15 to 35 percent by volume and cobbles from 3 to 7 percent."

These soils formed in redbed alluvium overlying deposits of sand, pebbles, and cobbles.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 inches which is nearly evenly distributed throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 115 days."
