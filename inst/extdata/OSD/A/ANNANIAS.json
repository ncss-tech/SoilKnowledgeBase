  "OVERVIEW": "The Annanias series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are found on lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
