The soils formed in alluvium from basic and intermediate extrusive igneous rocks, and to a lesser-extent sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year, with about 55 percent falling between April and September.  July, August and September are the wettest months, with December and January being the driest.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,500 feet.  The freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Tebbs soils are coarse-loamy, and are on similar landscape positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Alldown soils were previously classified as Torrifluvents, but they occur on relatively stable, non-flooding landscapes, and lack the irregular decrease in organic matter needed for that classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches.  (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon - from 10 to 28 inches (Bw horizon) based on structure and the higher color value than the Ap horizon. Because there is a lack of fine stratification below this depth, the cambic horizon could be extended deeper. At the present time there is reluctance deepen the cambic without field investigation.\nThe 04/2012 revision recognizes a cambic horizon in this soil and changes the classification from Ustic Torriorthents to Ustic Haplocambids. The cambic horizon is based on the lack of fine stratification and a color change. Although weakly expressed, a cambic horizon in this soil is consistent with the presumed late-Pleistocene or early-Holocene age of the geomorphic surfaces.  The 04/2012 revision also restricts the series to ustic-aridic only; the previous definition included mountain big sage plant communities that are now believed to be in an aridic-ustic regime. Those plant communities and their corresponding 12 to 14 inch annual precipitation are now excluded from the series.\nIt is assumed the SAR for this soil does not meet the criteria for the Sodic subgroup, despite the strongly alkaline reaction allowed within the upper 100 cm. This needs further investigation."
