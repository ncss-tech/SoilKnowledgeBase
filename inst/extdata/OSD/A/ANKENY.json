  "OVERVIEW": "The Ankeny series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian sediments. These soils are on base slopes, alluvial fans, high flood plains, and on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.",
