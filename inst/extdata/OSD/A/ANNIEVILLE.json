  "REVDATE": "03/2013",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Annieville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loess over till.  These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 725 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
