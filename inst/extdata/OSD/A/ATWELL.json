  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atwell soils are on mountains. They occupy concave to irregular, unstable slopes in areas of high drainage density. Slips and slides are common. Seeps and springs are common. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 18 to 874 meters (60 to 2870 feet). These soils formed in earthflow colluvium from sheared sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1780 to 2290 millimeters (70 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 250 to 290 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 29 centimeters (A & AB horizons)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 29 to 81 centimeters (BAt & Bt horizons)\n3. Redoximorphic features - in the zone from 81 to 205 centimeters (2Cg1, 2Cg2 & 2Cg3 horizons)\n4. Hapludalfs feature -. Base saturation of 35 to 50 percent, by ammonium acetate, within the zone from 29 and 81 centimeters (Bat & Bt horizons)\n5. Oxyaquic Hapludalfs - seasonal water table, reduced matrix, and aquic conditions for more than 30 days in most years within the zone from 81 to 100 centimeters\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 29 to 79 centimeters, averages 35 percent clay, by field estimate, and 25 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.50\nTypical pedon location was changed to better reflect the geographic distribution of the Atwell series (August 2007).\nADDITIONAL DATA: California Soil-Vegetation Survey samples 56-CA-12-14X and 57-CA-12-11X were collected at the type location. California Soil- Vegetation Survey sample 82-CA-12-03X was collected from this pedon in Redwood National Park. California Soil-Vegetation Survey sample 62-CA-12-28X was collected from another Atwell pedon in Humboldt County.\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 81CA605REDW003\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
