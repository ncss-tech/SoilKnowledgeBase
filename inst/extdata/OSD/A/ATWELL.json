The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1780 to 2290 millimeters (70 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).

Base saturation of 35 to 50 percent, by ammonium acetate, within the zone from 29 and 81 centimeters (Bat & Bt horizons)\n5. Oxyaquic Hapludalfs - seasonal water table, reduced matrix, and aquic conditions for more than 30 days in most years within the zone from 81 to 100 centimeters\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 29 to 79 centimeters, averages 35 percent clay, by field estimate, and 25 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.50\nTypical pedon location was changed to better reflect the geographic distribution of the Atwell series (August 2007)."
