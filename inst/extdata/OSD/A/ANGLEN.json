  "OVERVIEW": "The Anglen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial lake sediments with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  They are on glacial lake terraces and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
