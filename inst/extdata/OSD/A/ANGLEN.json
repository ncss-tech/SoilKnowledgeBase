These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  The thickness of the volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches.  Content of coarse fragments in the control section average from 0 to 5 percent. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon contains 35 to 50 percent clay.  Solum thickness exceeds 40 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR,  value of 5 to 7 dry, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5 moist or dry.  It  is massive or has a weak structure.  Some pedons have weakly developed A horizons up to 4 inches thick overlying the Bw horizons.\nThe 2E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and  dry.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe E part of the 2B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, dry values of 6 to 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chromas of 1  through 3 moist or dry. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  The B part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty  clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4    It is heavy silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam or clay. It has moderate to strong prismatic or  blocky structure.

It is stratified, silty clay, silty clay loam, clay, and very fine sandy loam.  It has moderate medium or  thick platy structure breaking to medium and coarse subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon when present has hue of 10YR, 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1  to 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, silty clay, silty clay loam, clay, or very fine sandy loam or is stratified  with 2 or more of these textures.  Reaction is neutral to slightly acid."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Anglen soils are slopes are 0 to 65 percent on terraces and terrace escarpments at elevations  of 1,900 to 4,000 feet.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and loess over glacial lacustrine materials.  They  occur in a climate characterized by cold wet winters and warm dry summers.  The average rainfall is 18 to 30 inches; mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.; and the frost-free period is estimated at 90 to 120 days."
