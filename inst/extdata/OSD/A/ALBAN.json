  "OVERVIEW": "The Alban series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy lacustrine deposits. These soils are on stream terraces, glacial lake plains, and delta kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
