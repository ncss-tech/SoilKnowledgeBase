  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is greater than 5 feet and ranges from 3 1/2 to 7 feet.\nThe A horizon ranges from very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  The Ap horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3) or brown (10YR 4/3).  The A horizon typically is silt loam, but ranges to silty clay loam.  The E horizon typically is grayish brown (10YR 5/2) or brown (10YR 5/3).  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The E horizon may be incorporated in the Ap horizon in eroded areas and may be evident only as silt coatings.  Some pedons have BE horizons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  The 2Btg horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 through 3.  It contains about 45 to 60 percent clay in the upper part.  The lower part contains about 40 to 45 percent clay.  Sand particles increase in amount and size with increasing depth.  Reaction commonly is medium to very strongly acid but ranges to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon is mottled gray (5Y 5/1) to yellowish brown (10YR 5/4 or 10YR 5/6) clay loam glacial till."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Atlas series in the same family and Clarinda, Edina, Keomah, Kernan, Lamoni, Putnam, Rathbun, Rinda, Sabina, and Weller series.  Atlas soils typically have lower clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon (less than 45 percent clay).  Clarinda, Edina, Putnam, and Rinda soils have thicker A horizons or darker colored Ap horizons.  In addition, Edina, and Putnam soils have an abrupt boundary between the A and B horizons.  Keomah and Weller soils have a lower clay maximum in the Bt horizon and contain less sand in the lower B and C horizons.  Kernan soils have a lower clay maximum in the Bt horizon and are formed in 35 to 55 inches of loess over glacial or lake bed sediments.  Lamoni soils have a mollic epipedon, a thinner Bt horizon and contain more sand and pebbles. Rathbun soils have lower sand content in the Bt and C horizons.  In addition, Rathbun soils have lower value, browner Bt horizons and developed from loess.  Sabina soils have less clay in the Bt horizons and contain more sand in the lower part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ashgrove soils typically are on convex side slopes and coves at heads of drainageways which dissect the nearly level or flat uplands.  They are common on the upper part of slopes that border the major drainage divides.  Slopes range from about 5 to 14 percent.  Ashgrove soils formed in exhumed gray clayey paleosols which were formed in glacial till commonly of Kansan age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 5l to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 34 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Rathbun and Weller series and the Keswick and Lindley series.  Rathbun and Weller soils formed in loess on higher and generally less sloping positions on the landscape.  Keswick soils formed in mostly reddish colored late Sangamon paleosols on slopes below the Ashgrove soils, and they have a stone line in the lower part of the A horizon or upper part of the B horizon.  Lindley soils are downslope and have formed in clay loam glacial till.  Ashgrove soils form a biosequence with the Clarinda soils which formed under prairie grasses and the Rinda series which formed under grass and trees."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  These soils are poorly drained. Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is medium to rapid.  These soils are seasonally wet and seepy.  Depth to an intermittent perched water table is 0 to 1 foot at some time from November through July in most years."
