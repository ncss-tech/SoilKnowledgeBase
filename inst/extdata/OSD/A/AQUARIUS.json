  "OVERVIEW": "The Aquarius series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from volcanic rock.  Aquarius soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 10 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
