  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arnica soils are on footslopes below upland areas of Pennsylvanian age sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent. These soils formed in a mantle of loamy colluvium or old alluvial sediments. Some pedons are underlain by clayey residuum weathered from sandstone or shale. The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 60 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

Cleora soils are coarse-loamy and are on flood plains adjacent to the Arnica soils. Cliquot soils formed in shale and are on side slopes above the Arnica soils."
