  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arnica series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a mantle of loamy colluvium or old alluvial sediments. Some pedons are underlain by clayey residuum weathered from sandstone or shale. These soils are on footslopes below upland areas of Pennsylvanian age sandstone and shale in MLRA 116B. Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the mean annual precipition is about 42 inches.",
