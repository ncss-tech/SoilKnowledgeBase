Slopes are 45 to 90 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,900 to 8,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
