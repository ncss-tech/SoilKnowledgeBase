  "OVERVIEW": "The Alchonzo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from monzonite.  Alchonzo soils are on north-facing mountainflanks of mountains.  Slopes are 45 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
