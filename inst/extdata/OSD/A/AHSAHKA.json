  "REVDATE": "12/2002",
  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ahsahka series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and a mixture of alluvium and material weathered from granitic rock.  Ahsahka soils are on benches, hills, canyon sideslopes and footslopes and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
