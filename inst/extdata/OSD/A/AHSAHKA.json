  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ahsahka soils are on hills, canyon sideslopes, footslopes and benches at elevations of 1,000 feet to 3,100 feet and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  These soils developed in loess and a mixture of alluvium and material weathered from granitic rock.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 21 to 26 inches and the frost-free season is 90 to 180 days."
