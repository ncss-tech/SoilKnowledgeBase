Bertelson soils do not have very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons within the particle-size control section and are dominated by alluvium from tuff and ignimbrite. Briabbit soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Crestline soils do not have very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons within the control section and are not calcareous above the calcic horizon. Declo soils have 0 to 15 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Eoyote soils lack gravel in the particle-size control section. Escalante soils do not have very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons within the particle-size control section. Kecko soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to carbonates and have 0 to 10 percent gravel in the control section. Sagehill soils are 25 to 76 cm deep to carbonates and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Somsen soils are moderately deep over hard bedrock. Strevell soils are 10 to 25 cm deep to carbonates and have Bk horizons with silt loam or loam textures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atlanta soils are at elevations of 1,680 to 1,985 meters. They are on fan aprons, fan skirts and inset fans that receive occasional flooding. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. They formed in alluvium derived from limestone with lesser amounts of welded tuff. The climate is semiarid mid-latitude steppe with cold winters and hot summers. Average annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. Mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C and the mean summer temperature is 19 to 22 degrees C. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
