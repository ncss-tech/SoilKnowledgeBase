  "OVERVIEW": "The Arispe series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils occur on short, convex side slopes and on head slopes.  Slope ranges from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.",
