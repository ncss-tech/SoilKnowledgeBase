  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: The soils are usually dry but are moist between depths of 10 to 30 cm for 60 days or more out of the 120 days following the winter solstice and are moist more than 25 percent of the time that the soil temperature is 5 degrees C or more; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.\nDepth to base of argillic horizon: 30 to 50 cm.\nDepth to bedrock: 30 to 50 cm to a lithic contact; In some pedons the bedrock is fractured with secondary carbonates or opaline silica on the lower sides of rock fragments.\nReaction: Neutral through moderately alkaline.\nAbrupt textural change: An abrupt horizon boundary is normally present between the A2 and the Bt1 horizon accompanied by an abrupt increase in clay content of between 15 and 25 percent absolute.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 60 percent.\nRock fragments: Averages 5 to 30 percent, mainly pebbles.  Lithology of fragments is volcanic rocks such as basalt.\nA horizons\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist; When the upper 18 cm of the epipedon is mixed, the dry value is 6.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nBt horizons\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 3 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 6, dry or moist.\nTexture: Clay, gravelly silty clay, gravelly silty clay loam, gravelly clay, gravelly clay loam, cobbly clay loam, or cobbly clay.\nClay content: 35 to 60 percent.\nConsistence: Firm or very firm, moist.\nOther features: Some pedons have accumulations of secondary silica as pendants on rock fragments. A Bt3 horizon is present in some pedons with calcium carbonate equivalent of 0 to 1 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Linkup and Millerlux series.\nLinkup soils do not have an abrupt textural change at the top of the Bt1 horizon and have more than 20 percent sand in the argillic horizon.  Millerlux soils commonly have an albic (E) horizon as part of the ochric epipedon, have slickensides in the argillic horizon, and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Anawalt soils are on lava plains, plateaus, hills, and mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,300 to 2,000 meters in Oregon and California and up to 2,380 meters in Nevada.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The mean summer temperature is 14 to 16 degrees C. and the mean winter temperature is about -3 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 40 to 90 days."

Oreneva soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have cambic horizons.  Pearlwise soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have thick mollic epipedons."
