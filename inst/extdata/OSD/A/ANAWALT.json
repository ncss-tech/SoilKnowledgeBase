  "OVERVIEW": "The Anawalt series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks with some loess and volcanic ash influence in the surface.  Anawalt soils are on lava plains, plateaus, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Millerlux soils commonly have an albic (E) horizon as part of the ochric epipedon, have slickensides in the argillic horizon, and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,300 to 2,000 meters in Oregon and California and up to 2,380 meters in Nevada.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The mean summer temperature is 14 to 16 degrees C. and the mean winter temperature is about -3 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 40 to 90 days."
