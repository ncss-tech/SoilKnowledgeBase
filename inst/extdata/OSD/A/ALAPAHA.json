Reaction of is very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout, except where limed.  The sandy epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Where it more than 9 inches thick, the value is more than 3.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or less; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Masses of iron accumulation range from none to common.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe BEg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 6 or 7.  Texture is sandy loam with pockets of loamy sand in some pedons.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 or less; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.\nThe Btv horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8; or more commonly, it has no dominant dolor and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, and yellow range from common to many.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Content of plinthite ranges from 5 to 35 percent, by volume.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon contains 15 to 30 percent clay.\nThe Btvg horizon, where present, has the same range in colors and textures as the Btg horizon.  Content of plinthite ranges from 5 to 10 percent, by volume."

The climate is warm and humid.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches, and average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 71 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent, but are dominantly less than 3 percent."
