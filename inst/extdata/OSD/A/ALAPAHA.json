  "OVERVIEW": "The Alapaha series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slow to slowly permeable soils in small drainageways, flats, seepage areas, and depressions.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine deposits of the Southern Coastal Plain.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
