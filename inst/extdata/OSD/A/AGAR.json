Fairlo soils have silty clay material within depths of 24 and 38 inches.  Highmore soils formed in silty drift and contain more sand and coarse fragments.  Holdredge soils have higher soil temperatures and typically are deeper to carbonates.  Monticello and Northdale soils have redder hue.  Paka soils formed in materials from siltstone and contain more sand."

DeGrey and Walke soils have natric horizons and are in slightly depressed areas.  Glenham soils have a fine-loamy control section and formed in glacial till and are on similar landscapes.  Lowry soils have a coarse-silty control section and do not have an argillic horizons and are on similar landscapes. Mobridge and Onita soils are in swales and have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick.  Raber soils have a fine textured control section and formed in firm, clay loam glacial till on slightly higher landscapes.  Sully soils do not have mollic epipedons, have a coarse-silty control section, and typically are on steeper landscapes."
