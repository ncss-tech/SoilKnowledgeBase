  "OVERVIEW": "The Anniesdraw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
