  "STATES": "MN,ND,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arveson series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed mostly in loamy glaciolacustrine or outwash sediments on glacial lake and outwash plains. These soils have moderate or moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid in the lower part. They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
