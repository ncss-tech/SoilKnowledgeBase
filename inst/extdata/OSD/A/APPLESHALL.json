    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Appleshall soils are on terraces in an intermound position.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,500 to 3,500 feet.  The soil formed in old mixed alluvium from basalt, granite and some metamorphic rock.  Climate is mesic with an annual precipitation of 16 to 25 inches, most of which falls as snow in winter.   The average annual air temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Appledellia soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a duripan.  All other soils lack a duripan.  Bakeoven soils are very shallow to basalt.  Deshler soils are moderately deep to tuff.  Gem and Meland are moderately deep to basalt.  Longrell, Midvale and Newell are deep.  Reywat and Riggins are shallow to basalt."
