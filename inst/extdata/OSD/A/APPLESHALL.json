  "OVERVIEW": "The Appleshall series consist of shallow, well drained soils that are formed in old mixed alluvium from basalt and some granite.  They are on terraces and have slopes of 2 to 10 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soil formed in old mixed alluvium from basalt, granite and some metamorphic rock.  Climate is mesic with an annual precipitation of 16 to 25 inches, most of which falls as snow in winter.   The average annual air temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Appledellia soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a duripan.  All other soils lack a duripan.  Bakeoven soils are very shallow to basalt.  Deshler soils are moderately deep to tuff.  Gem and Meland are moderately deep to basalt.  Longrell, Midvale and Newell are deep.  Reywat and Riggins are shallow to basalt."
