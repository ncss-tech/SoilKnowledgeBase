  "OVERVIEW": "The Apperson series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous residuum weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad, smooth ridges and slightly convex side slopes of prairie uplands in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112) and Bluestem Hills (MLRA 76).  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.  Mean annual (air) temperature is 60 degrees F.",

This soil has cracks that open and close periodically.\nThe A horizon is black (10YR 2/1) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1). It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BA horizon is black (10YR 2/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  It is silty clay loam or silty clay and ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btss1 horizon is black (10YR 2/1), very dark brown (10YR 2/2), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark gray (10YR  4/1) with redoximorphic concentration masses in shades of brown or red in many pedons. It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The clay content of the particle size control section averages between 35 and 60 percent.\nThe Btss2 horizon is very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), or brown or dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3). Redoximorphic depletion masses in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red occur in most pedons. Some pedons have vertical cracks filled with material from upper horizons.  These horizons range from slightly acid to moderately alkaline and some pedons are calcareous.  Slickensides, fine iron-manganese concretions, and calcium carbonate concretions occur in the Bt2ss and BCss horizons in most pedons.  Chert or limestone fragments and calcium carbonate concretions less than 3 inches in diameter make up from 0 to 5 percent by volume of the B2t horizon.\nThe BCss horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), brown or dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), olive brown (2.5Y 4/4), or light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4).  Redoximorphic depletion masses in shades of gray and brown and redoximorphic concentration masses in shades of yellow or red occur in most pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline and some pedons are calcareous.  Chert or limestone fragments and calcium carbonate concretions less than 3 inches in diameter make up from 0 to 10 percent by volume of the horizon.\nThe R layer consists of grayish hard limestone bedrock."
