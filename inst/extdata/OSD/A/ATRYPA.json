  "OVERVIEW": "The Atrypa series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale, with a minor component of colluvial materials from limestone, dolomite, and conglomerate rocks.  Atrypa soils are on foothills and mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
