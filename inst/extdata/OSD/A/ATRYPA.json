  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Atrypa soils are on foothill and mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, with a minor component of colluvial materials from limestone, dolomite, and conglomerate rock.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,950 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 90 days."

Fusulina and Labshaft soils are cryic, and in addition Labshaft soils are shallow over a lithic contact.  Locane soils are shallow over a lithic contact and have an argillic horizon.  Mau soils have a clayey-skeletal argillic horizon.  Sheege soils are cryic and have carbonatic mineralogy."
