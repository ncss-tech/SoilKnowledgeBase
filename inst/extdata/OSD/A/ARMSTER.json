  "STATES": "IA,KS,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Armster series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 18 to 50 centimeters of loess or loess and pedisediment and in the underlying reddish-colored late Sangamon paleosol weathered from till. These soils are on side slopes and ridges on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.",
