  "OVERVIEW": "The Abes series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from limestone.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Some pedons have a thin organic layer at the surface. The mollic epipedon ranges from 6 to 12 inches thick.  Thin discontinuous E horizons occur in some pedons. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 degrees to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 58 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches. Depth to the fractured limestone bedrock ranges from 15 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay loam or silt loam and has up to 15 percent gravel in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam, and contains up to 15 percent gravel in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mainly very gravelly silt loam or very cobbly silt loam but ranges to very cobbly silt loam or very gravelly or very cobbly silty clay.  Gravel and cobble content ranges from 40 to 60 percent."

These soils formed in material weathered from limestone. The climate is humid. The average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. Most of the precipitation comes as snow.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 20 to 50 days."
