  "OVERVIEW": "The Alhambra series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Alhambra soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture:  These soils are usually dry during most years, but are moist in some part more than 1/4 the time that soil temperatures are greater than 5 degrees C.; aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.\nMean annual temperature:  6.7 to 8.3 degrees C., and the mean summer temperature is 16.1 to 17.2 degrees C.\nOther features: Depth to the Ckq horizons is 10 to 46 cm and depth to unconformable sand and gravel is 75 to 100 cm.\nParticle-size control section: Less than 18 percent clay. The upper part is normally nongravelly, but contains up to 15 percent gravel in some pedons. Mineralogy is mixed but is influenced by volcanic ash.\nThe soils are usually calcareous throughout, but are noncalcareous in the immediate surface in some pedons.  pH values range from 8.4 to 9.6 and either remain constant or increase slightly with depth.  The control section is dominantly fine sandy loam and sandy loam, containing less than 18 percent clay.  Thin strata of loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam are in some pedons.  The soil has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Buried A1 horizons having value as low as 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 1 occur below 20 inches in some pedons.  The A1 horizon has weak to strong, very thin to medium platy structure, or it is massive.  It is soft to hard.  The C horizon above the unconformable gravel and sand has weak or moderate, thin to thick platy structure, or it is massive.  Its matrix material is soft or slightly hard dry, and very friable or friable moist.  The Ckq horizons contains 20 to 60 percent 1 to 3 cm diameter durinodes that are hard or very hard, firm or very firm or brittle.  A few very thin (less than 1 mm) and very hard silica and carbonate laminae line tubular pores and coat some ped surfaces where peds are present, but the laminae are unoriented and discontinuous.  The continuous weakly cemented layers usually occur below 100 cm.  Where the Ckq horizons is underlain by unconformable gravel, 15 to 41 cm thick weakly cemented horizons are present immediately above gravel.  These are hard or very hard and firm, and have common thin discontinuous silica laminae.  Unconformable loamy or silty lacustrine deposits are below 100 cm in some pedons."

Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium derived from mixed rock sources mainly sedimentary and volcanic, with some volcanic ash and pyroclastic materials from tuffs.  The climate is cool, semiarid, with a mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches most of which comes as snow in the winter.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F."
