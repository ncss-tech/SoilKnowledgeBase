  "OVERVIEW": "The Anchor Bay soils are podzolic Lithosols developed from hard coarse-grained sandstone high in quartz near the coast of northern California.  The soils are very stony and very shallow.  Climate is humid microthermal with cool, nearly rainless but foggy summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 inches to about 50 inches, and mean temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Growing season averages about 240 days, but during this period the highest daily temperature is normally less than 65 degrees F.\nThe Anchor Bay soils are associated in some places with the podzolic Blacklock and Noyo soils but are much shallower and stonier.",

Immediate surface has scattered rock fragments and in places a very thin layer of organic material.  General land surface has much rock outcrop.  This horizon grades into 1 to 6 inches.\n3 to 6 inches; light-gray, loose, very strongly acid very stony sand; almost entirely stone in lower part.  Broken surfaces of rock fragments are yellow and brownish yellow.  (2 to 8 inches)\n6 inches +; slightly weathered hard, but well-cracked, coarse-grained siliceous sandstone.  Many feet."
