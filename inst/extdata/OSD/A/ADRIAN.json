  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fishtrap and Timakwa series. Fishtrap soils have a difference of less than 16 degrees F between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures and are more acid than slightly acid in the underlying mineral material. Timakwa soils are derived primarily from woody organic materials and have woody fragments 3/4 inch to a foot in diameter in some part of the organic materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Adrian soils are in shallow closed depressions primarily on outwash plains, lake plains, lake terraces, and flood plains, but can occur within moraines and till plains. Areas range from a few acres to several hundred acres in size. Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent. Adrian soils formed in herbaceous organic materials over sandy deposits. Adjacent upland soils are usually sandy. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1143 mm (29 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 feet to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Antung, Edselton, Houghton and Granby soils. The very poorly drained Antung, Edselton, and Houghton soils are on similar landform positions as Adrian soils. Antung soils formed in less than 41 cm (16 inches) of herbaceous organic material. Edselton soils are underlain by marl and sand. Houghton soils formed in herbaceous organic deposits more than 130 cm (51 inches) thick and are the most common associate. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Granby soils are sandy throughout, and generally are at the margins of the depressions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic material and high or very high in the sandy material. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material and rapid in the sandy material. In the flooded phase, areas are subject to frequent flooding for long periods between October and June."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in native vegetation. Much of it is in marsh grasses including sedges, reeds, grasses, and shrubs such as willow, alder, quaking aspen, and dogwood. Some areas have been drained to various degrees and are used for hay and pasture. A small proportion is used for cropland. Corn and truck crops are the principal crops."
