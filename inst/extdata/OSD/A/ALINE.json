  "OVERVIEW": "The Aline series consists of very deep, somewhat excessive drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandy eolian deposits of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on undulating to rolling sandy deposits on terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual temperature is 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
