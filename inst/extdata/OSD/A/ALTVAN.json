  "OVERVIEW": "The Altvan series consists of moderately deep to sand or gravelly sand, well drained soils.  They formed in loamy sediments on uplands hillslopes and valley terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches), and mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
