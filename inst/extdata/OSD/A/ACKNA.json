  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 25 to 35 inches and includes part of the argillic horizon. The upper 15 to 23 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass content of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of acid oxalate extractable iron of .25 to .40 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air-dried samples. The particle-size control section has 25 to 35 percent clay and averages 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent in the Ap and A horizons. Depth to an extremely gravelly 3Bt horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to a 4C horizon is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist. Texture is ashy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe 2BAt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nThe 3Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry. The 3Bt1 horizon is extremely gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam. The 3Bt2 is extremely gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 4C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry. It is extremely gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand, or extremely gravelly coarse sand."

Cubhill soils have horizons with greater than 25 percent rock fragments of glacial till origin in the 2AB horizon and greater than 35 percent throughout argillic horizon, and has a mollic epipedon 15 to 25 inches thick. Hehe soils are 20 to 40 inches to weathered bedrock. Lainand soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. McDaniel soils have an argillic horizon that extends to 60 inches or more and are dry for 75 to 95 consecutive days. Millhouse soils have 20 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches to an extremely gravelly loamy sand 3C horizon. Skooker soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. The Setill soils are not competing however have a similar classification except for isotic mineralogy and they are 25 to 35 inches to compact glacial till 3Btd horizons."
