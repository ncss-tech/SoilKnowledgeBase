  "OVERVIEW": "The Alamosa series consists of deep, poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in moderately fine-textured mixed alluvium. Alamosa soils are on alluvial flood plains, old lake basins or alluvial fans with slope gradients of 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges 43 degrees to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible\nsecondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate accumulation ranges from 15 to 50 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in the solum and C horizon. The partical size control section contains 10 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand. Hue ranges from 5Y to 7.5YR in most pedons. Some pedons contain thin subhorizons of 5YR hue. Water table may range seasonally to 1 to 2 feet below the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline. Mottling in this horizon is faint to prominent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 4 through 6, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. Mottling in this horizon is faint to prominent.\nThe C horizon contain minor stratification and loamy sand with gravelly modifiers is in some pedons below 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alamosa soils are on alluvial flood plains, old lake basins, or alluvial fans. Slope gradients range from 0 to about 6 percent. The soil formed in moderately fine textured mixed alluvium. At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  The soil, however, is saturated with water due to a fluctuating water table throughout most of the season when not frozen. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 degrees to 43 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. In areas outside the San Luis Valley in southwest Colorado, mean annual precipitation ranges to 24 inches, however production by subirrigation is similar."
