  "OVERVIEW": "The Aspen soils are azonal soils formed on recent alluvial fan materials which have not been discernibly altered by weathering.  They have developed under subhumid conditions, with attendant cold winters and heavy snowfalls.  The parent materials are derived mainly from sedimentary rocks consisting of limestone, sandstone, and quartzite.",

Where irrigated, they are devoted mainly to general farming.  Alfalfa and wheat are the principal crops."
