These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,620 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
