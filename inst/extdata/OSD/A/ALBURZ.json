  "OVERVIEW": "The Alburz series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Alburz soils are along drainageways of hills and mountains and on axial stream flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
