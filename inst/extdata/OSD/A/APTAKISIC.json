The topography is relatively smooth and uniform with slope gradients ranging from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in silty material and calcareous stratified outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 940 mm (35 to 37 inches), mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

Zurich soils are on more rolling slopes in the landscape. Wauconda soils are bio-transitional between the Aptakisic soils (Aeric Ochraqualfs) and Mundelein soils (Aquic Argiudolls). The Del Rey soils are in lakebed positions in association with the Aptakisic soils and are fine textured."
