Rock fragments of shale channers and sandstone and quartzite pebbles range from 0 to 20 percent in the Ap horizon, 5 to 35 percent in the B horizon and 15 to 50 percent in the C horizon. The reaction in unlimed soils is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid or moderately acid in the lower part of the solum and strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon. Illite is the most abundant clay mineral, with chlorite, kaolinite and vermiculite also present.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 6. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR and 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. The B horizon has textures of loam, silt loam, silty clay loam and clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10 R through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures are loam, silt loam and clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

Altlanthus soils formed in residuum of metabasalt and greenstone schist. Cateache from red interbedded siltstone and shale . Culleoka, Frondorf and Loudonville soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches. Door soils have mollic epipedons. Duffield and Wheeling soils have hue in the B horizon that are 7.5YR or yellower. Dumfries formed in feldspathic sandy sediments of the Coastal Plain. Ebbing soil formed in alluvial material weathered from limestone, sandstone, quartzite, and shale on low stream terraces. Grayford soils formed in 0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 22 inches) of loess, till of Illinoian age, and residuum from limestone. Hayter soils formed in colluvium weathered from sandstone, shale and limestone in the Valley and Ridge Physiographic Province. Kell soils formed in loamy drift over residuum from acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Lamotte soils formed in a thin layer of loess and the underlying loamy residuum weathered from sandstone. Legore and Westmoreland soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.. Manassas soils have mottles within 40 inches. Mechanicsburg soils formed in Wisconsinan or Illinoian Age till 20 to 36 inches thick and material weathered from the underlying fractured, fine grained sandstone or siltstone on uplands. Middleburg, soils formed in colluvium and local alluvium from mixed basic and acid rock materials. Morrison soils formed in residuum of weathered noncalcareous sandstone. Myersville soils formed in material weathered from basic crystalline rocks, including greenstone, on nearly level to very steep uplands. Oatlands, Panorama and Sudley soils formed in residuum that weathered from Triassic-Jurassic interbedded sandstone and conglomerate of the Culpeper Basin and Triassic lowlands in the Northern part of the Piedmont.
