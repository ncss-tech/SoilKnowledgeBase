Rock fragments of shale channers and sandstone and quartzite pebbles range from 0 to 20 percent in the Ap horizon, 5 to 35 percent in the B horizon and 15 to 50 percent in the C horizon. The reaction in unlimed soils is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid or moderately acid in the lower part of the solum and strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon. Illite is the most abundant clay mineral, with chlorite, kaolinite and vermiculite also present.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 6. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR and 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.

Culleoka, Frondorf and Loudonville soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches. Door soils have mollic epipedons. Duffield and Wheeling soils have hue in the B horizon that are 7.5YR or yellower. Dumfries formed in feldspathic sandy sediments of the Coastal Plain. Ebbing soil formed in alluvial material weathered from limestone, sandstone, quartzite, and shale on low stream terraces. Grayford soils formed in 0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 22 inches) of loess, till of Illinoian age, and residuum from limestone. Hayter soils formed in colluvium weathered from sandstone, shale and limestone in the Valley and Ridge Physiographic Province.
