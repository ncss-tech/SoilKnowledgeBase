  "OVERVIEW": "The Andrecito series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on playas and playa steps. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
