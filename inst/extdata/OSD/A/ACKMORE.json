  "STATES": "IA,MO,NE,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ackmore series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains or alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 millimeters.",
