  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in coarse-loamy alluvium over fragmental alluvium derived mainly from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Ashley soils occur on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
