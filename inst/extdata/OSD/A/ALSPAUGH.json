The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The solum is 30 to 60 inches thick.  The depth to bedrock commonly is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue commonly of 5YR, but ranges to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and 4 or 5 dry.  It is clay loam, clay, or silty clay loam and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles of weathered andesite or tuff.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from andesite or tuff.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist.  Mean annual precipitation is 60 to 85 inches, mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, mean January temperature is about 41 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 140 to 200 days."
