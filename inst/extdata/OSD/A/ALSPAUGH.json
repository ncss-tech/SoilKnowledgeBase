  "OVERVIEW": "The Alspaugh series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium.  Alspaugh soils are on high old terraces and hill slopes at the edge of the mountainous areas and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
