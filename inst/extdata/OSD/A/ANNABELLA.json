  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Annabella soils are at elevations of 1,520 to 2,710 meters.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, inset fans, fan skirts, fan piedmonts, landslides and base slopes of hills. Annabella soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is semiarid, the average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm.  Mean annual air temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Ashdown, Bertelson and Calcross soils have 0 to 20 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Dixie soils have an argillic horizon.  Bertelson, Hiko Peak and Phage soils have a calcic horizon.  Monroe soils have a mollic epipedon and are fine-loamy."
