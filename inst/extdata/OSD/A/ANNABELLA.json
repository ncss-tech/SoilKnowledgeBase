  "OVERVIEW": "The Annabella series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks and some sedimentary rocks.  Annabella soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, fan skirts, inset fans, fan piedmonts, landslides and base slopes of hills or mountains. Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
