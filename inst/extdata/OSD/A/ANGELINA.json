In some pedons, pockets, lenses, or thin strata of more sandy material are within 50 inches below the soil surface.  Krotovina are common throughout the solum.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid.throughout.\nThe Ag horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral (N/) with value of 5 to 7.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Texture is is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam."

Bibb soils have less than 18 percent clay in particle size control section.  Kinston soils are not saturated for as long a period of time and support a lowland hardwood forest.  Lee soils contain chert throughout the profile.  Manco and Mantachie soils have less than 60 percent of the mass between the Ap and 30 inches dominated by chromas of 2 or less.  Herod, Nahatche, and Wehadkee soils have a pH of more than 5.5 in some part of the control section and, in addition, the Nahatche and Wehadkee soils have mixed mineralogy."
