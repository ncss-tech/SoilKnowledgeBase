Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The soil is in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 85 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 21 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 100 to 130 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 6 inches and a spodic horizon from 6 to 32 inches that has an assumed ratio of free iron to organic carbon of less than 0.2 in the upper 12 inches and more than 6 percent organic carbon throughout.  This soil previously was called Altapeak Variant.  This draft reflects a change in classification due to the Andisols order from loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryohumods to medial-skeletal, Spodic Haplocryands.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
