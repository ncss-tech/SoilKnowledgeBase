  "OVERVIEW": "The Alnult series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from granitic rock mixed with volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 75 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

This soil previously was called Altapeak Variant.  This draft reflects a change in classification due to the Andisols order from loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryohumods to medial-skeletal, Spodic Haplocryands."
