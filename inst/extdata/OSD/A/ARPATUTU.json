These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. Elevation is 330 to 1330 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 to 1225 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 to 16 degrees C.
