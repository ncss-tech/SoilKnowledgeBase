Culleoka soils form in colluvium or residuum from siltstone or interbedded sedimentary rocks. Door soils form in glacial outwash. Dumfries soils form in Coastal Plain marine and fluvial sediments. Ebbing soils form in alluvium from sedimentary rocks. Frondorf, Kell, Loudonville, and Spriggs\nsoils are moderately deep to lithic or paralithic contact. Lamotte soils form in loess over sandstone residuum. Mechanicsburg soils form in glacial till over sandstone or siltstone residuum. Williamsburg soils form in loess over glacial outwash."
