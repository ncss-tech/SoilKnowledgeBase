  "OVERVIEW": "The Alanthus series consists of very deep, well-drained soils, with moderate permeability, on uplands in the Blue Ridge Foothills.  The soil formed in residuum of metabasalt and greenstone schist. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
