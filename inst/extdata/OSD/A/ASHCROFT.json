  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashcroft series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or material weathered from conglomerate.  Ashcroft soils are on hills, ridges, mountain slopes, or fans and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 50 or more inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 inches to 10 or 12 feet; however, most areas of this soil have bedrock at depths of 4 to 5 feet.  Noncontrasting coarse textured material occurs at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the solum and C horizon range from 0 to 35 percent by volume and are mainly of gravel and cobble size.  Reaction ranges from pH 5.5 through 7.0.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5YR, value of 6 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Structure is typically weak platy or granular but is weak subangular blocky in some pedons.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  This horizon had medium to coarse, moderate to strong subangular blocky structure.  Dry consistence is slightly hard or hard.  It is sandy loam and ranges in clay from 7 to 18 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R."

Slope gradients range from 2 to 60 or more percent.  They formed in alluvial fan materials or deep residuum weathered from reddish-colored conglomerate.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 60 days."
