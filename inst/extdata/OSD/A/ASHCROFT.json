  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashcroft series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or material weathered from conglomerate.  Ashcroft soils are on hills, ridges, mountain slopes, or fans and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
