The assignment of the ashy substitute class and glassy mineralogy class is based on properties of associated soils and the vegetative community.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - The zone from 8 to 18 cm (E horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 18 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 38 cm to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section and substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 18 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)."
