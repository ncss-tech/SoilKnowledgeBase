Annemessex soils are differentiated from Mattapex by having a particle-size control section that is fine-loamy rather than fine-silty and having a seasonal water table between 25 and 51 cm (10 and 20 inches).\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 cm (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 64 cm (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2BtG horizons).\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions with color value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less, and redox concentrations within the upper 61 cm of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year.\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 152 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S02MD039-007. Additional reference samples include sample numbers S99MD039-017-1, 2; S00MD039-057-1, 2,3; S00MD039-189-1, 2,3; (University of Maryland, College Park, MD).\nData Mapunit ID: 409002; User Pedon ID: Annemessex-OSD\nRevised: 02/2002-SYD, AMH, JAK; 02/2004-SYD, AMH, DHK; 09/2004-SYD, JWB, 04/2007-JWB\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
