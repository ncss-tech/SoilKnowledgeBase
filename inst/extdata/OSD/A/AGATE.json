  "OVERVIEW": "The Agate series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium.  Agate soils are the mound area of patterned ground on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days within the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragment of which 10 to 25 percent are gravel and 0 to 10 percent are cobbles.  The soil material above the duripan is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, gravelly loam, or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist and 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  It is coarse sandy loam and loamy sand with 40 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles.  Stratified layers of loam and silt loam may occur within these horizons."
