  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days within the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragment of which 10 to 25 percent are gravel and 0 to 10 percent are cobbles.  The soil material above the duripan is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, gravelly loam, or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist and 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  It is coarse sandy loam and loamy sand with 40 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles.  Stratified layers of loam and silt loam may occur within these horizons."

Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in stratified old alluvium of mixed lithologies.  Elevation is 1,100 to 1,850 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees  F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."
