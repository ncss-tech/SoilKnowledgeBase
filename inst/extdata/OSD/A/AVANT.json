R material consists of highly fractured, hard, chert bedrock with thin clay coatings in cracks; horizontal spacing between cracks is typically 10 cm or more; strata of R material range from 30 to 91 cm (1 to 3 ft) or more in thickness. The fine earth or C material consists of mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), yellowish red (5YR 5/6), and gray (10YR 6/1) stratified clay, clay loam and very fine sandy loam; strata of C material range from less than 3 to 15 cm (1 in to 6 in) in thickness; C material is very strongly acid."

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to fractured, rippable, chert bedrock ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) and due to the irregular boundary between the Bt horizon and the underlying tilted bedrock, it is extremely variable within short distances. Reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid throughout. Content of chert fragments ranges from 35 to 90 percent by volume throughout.\nA horizon:\nHue:  10YR\nValue :  3 or 4\nChroma:  2 or 3\nor Hue:  7.5YR\nValue: 4\nCroma of 2, 3 or 4\nWhere the A horizon has moist value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3, it is less than 6 inches thick.\nTexture:  very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or their extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogs\nE horizon has hue of 10YR\nValue:  5 or 6\nChroma:   of 3 or 4\nTexture:  very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or their extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogs\nBE horizon:\nHue:  10YR or 7.5YR\nValue:  5\nChroma:  4, 6 or 8\nTexture:  very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or their extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogs.\nBt horizon:\nHue:  10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR\nValue:  5 or 6\nChroma:  4, 6, or 8\nor Hue:  5YR:\nValue:  4\nChroma:  4, 6, or 8\nTexture:  very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly silty clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam, or their extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogs\nThe R/C horizon\nConsists of alternating strata of highly fractured, hard, chert bedrock and fine earth material with a dip ranging from 30 degrees to near vertical. The\nR material is typically, highly fractured, hard, chert bedrock. Horizontal spacing between fractures is typically 10 cm or more. Due to the fractured nature of the chert\nbedrock, excavation can normally be made with common construction equipment. The C material has stratified textures ranging from clay to very fine sandy loam\nwith colors in shades of brown, gray, red or yellow. Because of faulting and folding, this horizon is extremely variable within short distances."
