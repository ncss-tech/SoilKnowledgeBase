  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of mudstone or siltstone lake deposits is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is less than 10 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 50 to 55 F.  The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is usually dry all of the time from July 15 until October 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The soil has cracks that open and close once each year, remain open during the period of July through October and remain closed the rest of the year.  Few to many intersecting slickensides occur in the lower A horizon.  Rock fragments range to 25 percent of the surface horizon and occur just on the surface and consist mostly of rounded basalt cobbles.  The control section usually has 60 to 70 percent clay and ranges to 75 percent clay in some pedons.\nThe A horizon is pale brown and brown to olive or dark grayish brown dry and moist (10YR or 5Y 6/3, 6/2, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2; 2.5Y 6/2; 5/2, 4/2).   When the dry value is 4 or 5, the moist value is 4 or more.  The A horizon is clay or silty clay and has strong granular structure in the surface few inches and strong angular blocky or prismatic structure in the lower part.  It increases in pH and in carbonates as depth increases.\nThe Bk horizon is light gray, pale brown, or light brownish gray in 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  The Cr horizon is soft siltstone or mudstone that crushes to silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and has rock structure."

The climate is cool semiarid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Average January temperature is 28 F; average July temperature is 68 F; mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 F.   The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days.  In southwestern Idaho elevation is 2,300 to 3,000 feet and the frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."

Daphnedale soils have mollic epipedons, argillic horizons and have frigid soil temperature regimes.
