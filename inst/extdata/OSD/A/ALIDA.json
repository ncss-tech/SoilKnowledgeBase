Coarse fragments consisting of shale and gravel range from 0 to l0 percent in the A horizons and l to 20 percent in the remainder of the solum and in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of l0YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of l or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam, and is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of l0YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  It is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe B3 horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of l to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and shaly analogues of these textures.  It is slightly to very strongly acid.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of l to 4.  It is usually stratified.  It is sand, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam and shaly analogues of these textures.  It is medium acid to neutral.  Carbonates are at depths greater than 6 feet."

Ashippun, Locke, Macomb, Montmorenci, Mosel, and Symco soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Glenhall and Kibbie soils contain less shale in the solum and contain carbonates above 5 feet.  Kasson soils have less sand in the top 20 inches of the profile and lack stratification.  Lineville soils dominantly have redder hue in the lower part of the solum which consists of till.  Lourdes soils have more clay in the lower part of the sola and are not stratified.  Newry soils are less acid and formed in loess and till."
