  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F and is 44 to 47 degrees F when an O horizon is present.  Depth to a strongly cemented duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  It is moderately acid to slightly acid.  The moist bulk density is 1.00 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter in the soil material above the duripan.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry."
