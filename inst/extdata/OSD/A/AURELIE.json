  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 55 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is more than 165 centimeters. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 50 percent in the O and A horizons, and in the Eg horizon where present, and from 5 to 30 percent in the B and Cd horizons. Rock fragments are mainly channers, gravel, and cobbles.  Stones cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface. Clay content is 18 to 27 percent throughout the particle size control section and substratum.\nThe O horizons where present, have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. They are very friable or friable. They are extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is very friable or friable, and extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Eg horizon where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2. It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is very friable to firm, and extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam, but includes fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate very fine to medium granular, subangular blocky, or weak or moderate, thin or medium platy which parts in some pedons to weak or moderate, very fine subangular blocky structure.  It is very friable, friable, or firm, and very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has moderate or strong, coarse or very coarse prismatic, weak or moderate medium or thick platy, or weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure. It is friable to very firm, and strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is dominantly loam or silt loam but includes clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Any soil structural units in the Cd horizon are considered to be geogenic and are generally platy or prismatic. The Cd layer is firm or very firm. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aurelie soils are on lower slopes of ridges and on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in till derived mainly from slates, metasandstones, phyllites and shales. The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 86 to 116 centimeters. The frost free season ranges from 80 to 105 days. Elevation ranges from 36 to 762 meters above mean sea level."

The Daigle and Perham soils are better drained, receiving less runoff or having steeper slopes. The Elliottsville, Monson, Thorndike, and Winnecook soils are better drained, shallower to bedrock, and are on higher positions on the landscape."
