    "content": "REMARKS: The Ashford series was included in the Panola series. The classification was changed from Vertic Ochraqualfs to Dystraquerts based on a revision to taxonomy.  The type location was moved to Bossier Parish, Louisiana in 2004 at a site that has full NSSL characterization data (NSSL ID: 96LA015024 and 96LA015025). Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 4 inches (Ag horizon).\nCambic horizon - 4 to 80 inches (Bg and Bssg horizons).\nSlickensides - 15 to more than 80 inches (Bss horizons).\nAquic conditions - 0 to greater than 80 inches (Ag, Bg, Bssg1, Bssg2, Bssg3, Bssg4, and Bssg5 horizons have saturation, reduction, and dominant chromas of 2 or less with redox concentrations)\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD NUMBER TX0770.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
