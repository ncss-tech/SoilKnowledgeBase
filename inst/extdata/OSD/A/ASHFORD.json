Alligator soils formed in Mississippi River alluvium. Consul soils formed in clayey sediments overlying alkaline shale. Eutaw soils have a solum that is less than 30 inches thick. Beaumont soils are hyperthermic and Bevil soils are in a fine family. Estes soils have chroma of 3 or more when the value is 6 or more, or chroma of 2 or less when the value is 5 or less.within the upper 30 inches of the soil. Gladewater soils have reaction of 5.0 or more throughout more than half of the upper 20 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Ashford series was included in the Panola series. The classification was changed from Vertic Ochraqualfs to Dystraquerts based on a revision to taxonomy.  The type location was moved to Bossier Parish, Louisiana in 2004 at a site that has full NSSL characterization data (NSSL ID: 96LA015024 and 96LA015025). Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 4 inches (Ag horizon).\nCambic horizon - 4 to 80 inches (Bg and Bssg horizons).\nSlickensides - 15 to more than 80 inches (Bss horizons).\nAquic conditions - 0 to greater than 80 inches (Ag, Bg, Bssg1, Bssg2, Bssg3, Bssg4, and Bssg5 horizons have saturation, reduction, and dominant chromas of 2 or less with redox concentrations)\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD NUMBER TX0770.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
