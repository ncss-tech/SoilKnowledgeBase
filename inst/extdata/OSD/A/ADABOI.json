  "OVERVIEW": "The Adaboi series consists of very deep, well drained soils with low saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from silty lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
