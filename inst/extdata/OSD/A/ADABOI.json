Aradaran and Hann soils do not have Glossic or buried argillic horizons. Ayette soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have a mollic epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick. Darow, Gimmi, Karney, Kuck and Ukiah soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Forsgren soils are calcareous at depths of 40 to 55 inches. McDesh soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Montour soils are calcareous at depths above 40 inches. Tub soils have secondary carbonates at a depth of 18 to 37 inches."
