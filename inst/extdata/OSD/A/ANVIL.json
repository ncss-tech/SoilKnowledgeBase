  "OVERVIEW": "The Anvil series consists of very deep, moderately well  drained soils formed in high energy alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Anvil soils are in ephemeral drainages and small creek bottoms.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soil is dry in the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 day period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5 YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5  moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The texture is coarse sandy loam, very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, extremely cobbly coarse sand, coarse sand, very gravely loamy sand, and fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 70 percent, with the control section averaging more than 35 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.  Redox concentrations commonly occur in the lower part of this horizon."
