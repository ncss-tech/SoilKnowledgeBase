  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  At a depth of 20 inches the mean winter soil temperature is about 57 F, the mean summer soil temperature is about 96 F, and the mean annual soil temperature about 74 F.  Gravel content ranges from 1 to 20 percent, except the immediate surface pavement may have more than 20 percent.  The soils are usually dry and are calcareous throughout.  Organic matter content is less than 0.5 percent and decreases regularly with depth.  The undisturbed surface has a weak to moderate pavement of pebbles that usually have a weak desert varnish.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, dry value of 6 to 7 or rarely 8; moist value or 5 or 6, dry chroma of 2 through 5, and moist chroma of 4 through 6.  It ranges from fine sand to fine sandy loam.  In undisturbed areas, it has weak to strong platy structure and in tilled areas it is massive or single grained.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard.  It ranges in pH from about 7.9 to 8.4.  It is slight to violently effervescent which is stronger on the surface of plates than on broken edges.\nThe Bk horizon ranges slightly lighter or slightly redder than the A horizon, but has essentially the same color range slightly lighter or slightly redder than the A horizon.  The 10 to 40 inch zone is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam and has less than 18 percent clay.  The Bk horizon commonly is massive, but ranges to having weak structure.  It is soft to slightly hard.  Lime accumulations in the form of soft masses, concretions and coatings on pebbles occur less than 10 inches below the surface and some secondary lime continues to a depth of 40 inches or more.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent.\nGenerally, the C horizons below 45 to 65 inches consist of loose, fine sand."

The Coolidge, Laveen, Rillito and Toltec soils are intermitantly moist within the moisture control section during July through September. In addition the Laveen soilsare loam and very fine sandy loam in the control section, Rillito soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel and Toltec soils have coarse fragments consisting of pan fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aco soils are on terraces slightly above the flood plain at elevations of 30 to about 1,000 feet.  Slopes are less than 8 percent and usually less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in relatively young coarse and moderately coarse textured alluvium from a wide variety of rocks.  The climate is arid with an average annual precipitation of about 4 inches that occurs as gentle winter rains or as erratic high intensity summer storms.  The average July temperature is about 92 F, the average January temperature is about 53 F, and the mean annual temperature is about 72 F.  The frost-free season is about 290 days."

All of these soils except Chuckawalla and Orita occur on flood plains at slightly lower elevations than Aco and lack lime segregations.  Chuckawalla and Orita soils are generally at slightly higher elevations and have argillic horizons."
