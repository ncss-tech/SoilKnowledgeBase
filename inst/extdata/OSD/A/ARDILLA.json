    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Depth to the seasonal high water table is less than 18 inches. Except where the surface has been limed, the reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the lower part.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Where the value and chroma are 3 or less, it is less than 7 inches thick. Texture is coarse sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is coarse sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, red, brown or gray range from none to common. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 t0 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, red, brown or gray range from few to many. Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value OF 4 to 6, and chroma OF 4 to 8; or there is no dominant color and is variegated in shades of red, brown yellow or gray. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, red, brown and gray range from common to many. Ironstone pebbles range up to 10 percent, by volume. Below a depth of about 30 inches, the percent of plinthite by volume ranges from 0 to about 4 percent, by volume. Brittleness by volume ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Some pedons have common to many 2 to 10 mm pockets of clean sand grains and most pedons have soft iron enriched spheroidal masses 1 to 5 mm in diameter. Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Atlee, Cedarbluff, Eylau and Swafford series in the same family and the Clarendon, Robertsdale, and Saucier series in closely related families. Atlee and Eylau soils are moderately well drained. Cedarbluff soils formed in alluvium that derived from sandstone and shale in the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valley (MLRA 128) and have more than 20 percent silt in the control section. The moderately well drained Swafford soils are in MLRA 128 and are subject to rare flooding. Clarendon, Robertsdale and Saucier soils have less than 40 percent brittleness in their profiles. In addition, Clarendon and Saucier are moderately well drained while Robertsdale soils have more than 20 percent silt in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ardilla soils are on level to gently sloping Coastal Plain uplands. They formed in thick beds of loamy marine sediments. The climate is humid subtropical. The median temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the medium rainfall ranges from 48 to 57 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the Robertsdale series, these include the Cowarts, Dothan, Dunbar, Escambia, Pansey, Plummer and Tifton series. The moderately well and well drained Cowarts soils are on more sloping higher positions, have sola less than 40 inches thick and have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite. The well drained Dothan and Tifton soils are on higher adjacent positions. Dunbar soils are on similar positions but have fine control sections. Escambia soils are on similar landforms, but have coarse-loamy control sections. The very poorly and poorly drained Pansey and Plummer soils are on lower adjacent positions. In addition, Plummer soils have surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness and lacks plinthite."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Ardilla soils are in woodland that consists of loblolly pine, longleaf pine and slash pines along with scattered sweetgum and oaks. The understory consists of greenbrier, gallberry, wax myrtle and various grasses.  Areas that have been cleared areas are primarily used for pasture, soybeans and corn. A few small areas are used for truck crops."
