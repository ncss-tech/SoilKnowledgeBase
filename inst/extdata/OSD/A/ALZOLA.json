  "OVERVIEW": "The Alzola series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Alzola soils are on outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
