These soils formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 330 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 75 to 90 days."
