Depth to lamellae ranges from 40 to 78 inches but most commonly is 50 to 70 inches.  Cumulative thickness of lamellae ranges from 1 cm to 15 cm.  Content of silt plus clay in the 10 to 40-inch control section ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Streaks and pockets of uncoated sand grains range from none to common.  Some pedons have organic matter accumulations in shades of brown in the lower part.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E part of the E&Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Sand grains are mostly uncoated.\nThe B part (lamellae) of the E&Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The lamellae range from 1 to 25 mm thick and range from 1 cm to more than 1 m in horizontal length.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, is more than 80 inches below the surface.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Catpoint, Duffern, and Hainesville series in the same family.  The somewhat excessively drained Catpoint and Hainesville soils are on terrace positions of large streams and have a seasonal water table between depths of 48 to 72 inches.  In addition, Hainesville soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Duffern soils are on similar positions but are dry in the moisture control section for more than 125 cumulative days in most years."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alpin soils are on uplands and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in thick beds of sandy eolian or marine deposits on older landscapes.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F."

The somewhat excessively drained Blanton and Troup soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick.  The somewhat poorly drained Chipley soils are on lower positions.  The moderately well drained to excessively drained Foxworth soils are on similar to lower positions.  Kershaw soils are on similar to lower positions and are in an uncoated family.  Lakeland soils are on similar to higher positions.  The moderately well drained Ortega soils are on similar to lower positions and are in an uncoated family.  The well drained Lucy and Wagram soils are on similar positions but have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas are planted to pine.  Some small areas have been cleared and are used for tobacco, peanuts, watermelons, and tame pasture.  The native vegetation consists of scattered slash pine and longleaf pine, turkey oak, post oak, blackjack oak, and bluejack oak.  The understory is dominated by bluestem, low panicums, fringeleaf paspalum, and native annual forbs."

This concept provides for sandy soils that have lamellae that total less than 6 inches thick within depths of 80 inches.\nDepth to seasonal water table is more than 80 inches.  Some low terraces flood occasionally for brief periods.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Characterization Data - S12-5-(1-6), S16-20-(1-6), S33-9-(1-5), S37-23-(1-5), S40-10-(1-5), S65-12-(1-5).
