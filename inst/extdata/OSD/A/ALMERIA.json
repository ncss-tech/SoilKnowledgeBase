  "OVERVIEW": "The Almeria series consists of very deep poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in stratified sandy alluvium on valley flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters (20 inches).",
