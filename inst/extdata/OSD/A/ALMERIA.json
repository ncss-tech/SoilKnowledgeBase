I just visited with Dave in Valentine and he scanned 23 Almeria 232 descriptions in Cherry Co. Only about 3 out of 23 had loamy (actually fsl) layers above 40 inches. Perhaps the typical pedon needs to be relocated. Also, the loamy layer in the original pedon for the Almeria OSD has 63.5% sand (S85NE115-034). I guess, the location was moved being the one in Loup Co. had a fsl surface which is allowed but maybe not typical for the series.\n5/2002 RRZ: Added loamy sand to ROC of Cg horizon\n12/29/2003 WAW: added mucky loam as texture in A horizon\n1/2006 LRM: metric conversion and changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity\n10/12/2006 RRH: Typical pedon: added thin strata of loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam to A and Cg horizons as per original soils description. Changed 2Cg3 horizon to 2Ab and 3Cg4 horizon to 2Cg; Type Location: corrected quad and lat/long. Range of Characteristics: added mucky fine sandy loam and mucky peat to A horizon and changed thin strata in Cg horizons to of finer or coarser textured layers including mucky mineral and organic layers; Geographically Associated Soils: revised and added Fluvaquents, sandy (associated at type location); Drainage: corrected. Use and Vegetation: corrected.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon S85NE115-034 was sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
