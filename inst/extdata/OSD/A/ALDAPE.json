  "OVERVIEW": "The Aldape series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils with moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in alluvium from lacustrine deposits and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent in foothills and valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
