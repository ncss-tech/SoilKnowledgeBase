  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Abiqua soils are on flood plains, terraces and fans at elevations of 250 to 1000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in silty and clayey  alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 40 to 60 inches but may range to 70 inches in some areas. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The average July temperature is about 67 degrees F. and the average January temperature is about 39 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Nekia soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact and are on adjacent hillslopes. Waldo soils have redox depletions throughout the solum and are on flood plains adjacent to the river or stream. McAlpin soils have redox depletions at 20 to 30 inches and are on flood plains, terraces, and fans."
