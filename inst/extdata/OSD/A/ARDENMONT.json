    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cobbler, Enson (T), Green Bluff, Labuck, and Stapaloop series.  Soils with similar classifications are the Kaniksu, Karamin, and Torboy series. Cobbler soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, have 5 to 40 percent rock fragments of granite, schist, gneiss, or quartzite origin with no pararock fragments.  Enson soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments of granodiorite origin with no pararock fragments.  Green Bluff are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, have 0 to 15 percent gravel of glaciofluvial origin with no pararock fragments, and contain lamellae.  Labuck soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact (granodiorite) and 15 to 35 percent fine gravel of granite origin with no pararock fragments.  Stapaloop soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, contain lamellae, and have 0 to15 percent gravel of glacifluvial origin with no pararock fragments.  Kaniksu soils lack weathered schist fragments and have rounded coarse fragments of mixed lithology. Karamin soils have 0 to 10 rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Torboy soils lack weathered schist fragments and have 10 to 35 percent rounded coarse fragments of mixed lithology."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ardenmont soils are on mountain side slopes. Elevation is 2,200 to 4,700 feet. Slopes are 8 to 90 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from schist mixed with ash and loess in the surface. They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches. The mean annual January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F.is 120 to 160 days."

Nahahum soils are fine-loamy. Ardening and Shamel soils have a mollic epipedon. Kloochman soils have 30 to 60 percent volcanic ash in the upper 7 to 14 inches and are moderately deep. Tillicum soils are dominated by amorphous material material in the upper 5 to 20 inches of the particle-size control section. Tyee soils are 10 to 20 inches to a paralithic contact."
