Alley soils have carbonates within 40 to 56 cm. Chime soils have a paralithic contact at 50 to 75 cm.  Cleghorn soils have 0 to 5 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Glyphs and Zevadez soils have continuous weakly cemented horizons at depth of 30 to 50 cm. Igert soils are moderately deep to hard bedrock. Mimentor soils have A horizons that are neutral. Qwynn soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Nevador soils have segregated carbonates with a depth of 100 cm and have Cq horizons that have durinodes in a friable matrix.  Wedlar soils have additional soil moisture from thunderstorms during the summer months."
