    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. These soils are usually moist; they are dry in the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is typically 40 to 60 inches but may be greater than 60 inches in some pedons. The particle-size control section is from the mineral soil surface to 40 inches below the mineral surface. The upper (ashy) part is 14 to 30 inches thick, has moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cubic centimeter, 60 to 80 percent glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction, phosphate retention of 60 to 90 percent; and ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.5 to 3.0 percent, eight times silica plus two times iron of 5 to 12 percent and eight times silica minus two times iron of 4 to 8 percent. The lower (loamy-skeletal) part of the pscs has 5 to 15 percent clay, less than 25 percent very coarse, coarse and medium sand, and 60 to 85 percent angular rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is ashy silt loam or gravelly ashy silt loam, with 10 to 30 percent gravel. Base saturation (sum of cations) is 20 to 35 percent.\nThe 2C horizon (some pedons described with 2Eb and 2Bwb horizons) has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. The fine earth fraction is loam or sandy loam. It is 60 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral and base saturation (sum of cations) is 35 to 65 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Angelpeak soils are on north-facing side slopes of mountains. Elevations range from 6,200 to 8,500 feet. Slope is 30 to 80 percent. The soil is formed in colluvium derived dominantly from argillite with a mantle of volcanic ash in the surface. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  The average annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 20 to 40 days."
