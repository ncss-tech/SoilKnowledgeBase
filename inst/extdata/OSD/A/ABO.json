  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are saturated with water in a subhorizon between depths of 30 to 40 inches for a short period in summer and have dominant chroma of 2 or less accompanied by redox segregations of iron or manganese within a depth of 30 to 40 inches.  Depth to the Bk horizon is 11 to 32 inches.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 40 to over 60 inches.\nIf present, the A1 horizon is thin and indistinct.  The Ap horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon is commonly noneffervescent and slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is clay loam or silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and contains more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  It has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon is commonly noneffervescent and slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate.  It is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon when present is stratified coarse sand to coarse sandy loam with up to 15 percent fine gravel.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in somewhat stratified alluvium or possibly shallow lake-laid sediments of mixed mineralogy.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 3 feet of snow.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
