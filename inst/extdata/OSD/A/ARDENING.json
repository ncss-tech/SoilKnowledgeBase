  "OVERVIEW": "The Ardening series consists of deep, well drained soil formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from schist with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess mixed in the surface.  Ardening soils are on mountainsides that usually have a southerly aspect and slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to a paralithic contact with schist or gneiss is 40 to 60 inches.  The solum is 24 to 40 inches thick.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between the depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 15 to 35 percent weathered schist fragments.  The reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  Unweathered pebbles range from 10 to 20 percent and unweathered cobbles from 0 to 5 per;cent.  Weathered rock fragments range from 1 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak fine or medium subangular structure.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with 15 to 25 percent unweathered pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent weathered rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 15 to 30 percent unweathered pebbles, 59 to 15 percent cobbles, and 10 to 25 percent weathered rock fragments."

Billyridge, Canderly, and Crouch soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Burrant soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Conconully, Picard, and Rebecca soils are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  Cantelli, Ginnis, Shangland, Spokane, and Usk soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Donovan soils lack weathered rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Fanal soils have a thicker solum.  Hellgate soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days and are 25 to 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Phoebe soils lack rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Wind River soils lack rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have a solum 15 to 25 inches thick."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from schist mixed with ash and loess in the surface. They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches.  The mean annual January temperature is about 24 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees is about 130 to 180 days."
