The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from welded tuff and rhyolite with a component of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,495 to 2,045 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm.  The average annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C.  The frost free season is 90 to 120 days."
