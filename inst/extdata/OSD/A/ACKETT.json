  "OVERVIEW": "The Ackett series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow to a duripan, that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from welded tuff.  They are on stream terraces, fan piedmont remnants, partial ballenas, and lower hillsides.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the average annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
