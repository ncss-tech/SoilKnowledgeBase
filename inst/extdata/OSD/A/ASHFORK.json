  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashfork series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt and pyroclastics.  Ashfork soils are on hills and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
