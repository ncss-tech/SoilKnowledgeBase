The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt and pyroclastics including tuff, volcanic breccias and agglomerate. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 54 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches and occurs as thunderstorms in July, August and September and as rain and snow in the winter.  The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 160 days."
