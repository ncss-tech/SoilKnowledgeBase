  "OVERVIEW": "The Ascalon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderate coarse textured calcareous material.  Ascalon soils are on upland hillslopes and tableland plains. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (49 degrees F) at the type location.",
