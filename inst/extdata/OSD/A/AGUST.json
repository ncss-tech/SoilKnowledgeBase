The regolith consists of calcareous, gravelly-textured alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 76 degrees F. Frost-free period is 240 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 1,965 to 3,935 feet."
