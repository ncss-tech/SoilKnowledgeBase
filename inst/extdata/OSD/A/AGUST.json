  "OVERVIEW": "The Agust series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in loamy, mixed, gravelly sediments. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils on piedmont slopes, alluvial fans, and high terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F.",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 76 degrees F. Frost-free period is 240 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 1,965 to 3,935 feet."
