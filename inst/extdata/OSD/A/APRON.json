  "OVERVIEW": "The Apron series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium from calcareous sandstone interbedded with shale. These soils are on fan aprons, alluvial fans, fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
