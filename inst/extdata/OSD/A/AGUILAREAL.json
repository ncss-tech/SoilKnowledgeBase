    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cupel (AZ), Garzona (AZ), Pacific Mesa (CA) and Pulsipher (NV) series. Cupel, Garzona and Pulsipher receive an average of more than 250 millimeters (10 inches) of precipitation annually. In addition, Cupel has more than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section, Garzona is formed in volcanic or pyroclastic parent material and Pulsipher is formed in schist. Pacific Mesa soils are formed in andesite or basalt and have CCE of 1 to 5 percent in the control section."
