The series has a silicate clay decrease exceeding 20 percent due to\ndilution by secondary calcium carbonate. A proposal to maintain \"pale\" status\nfor such soils on old stable landscapes has been submitted to the National\nLeader for Soil Taxonomy and Standards.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 30 to 203 cm (12 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btkk, Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 97 to 203 cm (38 to 80 in) (Btkk, Btk)\nPlugged (kk) horizon: 97 to 51 cm (38 to 58 in) (Btkk)\nNote: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Laboratory data available: S81TX-069-002 (Castro County,\nTexas); S74TX-303-002, S80TX-303-001, S80TX-303-002, S81TX-303-001 (Lubbock\nCounty, Texas); S53TX-305-065, S95TX-305-001, S95TX-305-009, S95TX-305-013,\nS95TX-305-014, S95TX-305-018 (Lynn County, Texas).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
