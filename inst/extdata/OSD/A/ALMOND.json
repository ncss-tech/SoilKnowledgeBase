  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Almond series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands. The soils formed in till derived from soft shale, and some siltstone and sandstone. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the subsoil and low to moderately low in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C (44 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1120 mm (37 in).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 61 to 140 cm (24 to 55 in). Depth to shale bedrock ranges from 102 cm to 3 m (40 in to 10 ft). Rock fragments, mainly channers of shale and siltstone, range from 10 to 35 percent in the solum and from 15 to 60 percent in C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure and very friable or friable consistence. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nSome undisturbed pedons have an A horizon 2 to 4 in thick with color, texture, and structure similar to Ap the horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 with distinct or prominent mottles. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, medium to very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky, or the prisms are absent. Consistence is commonly friable or firm but the range includes very friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has color and texture ranges similar to the B horizon. The horizon is massive or platy, with rock structure evident in most pedons. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Aurelie, Atherton, Easton, Fremont, Gulf, Hornellsville, Kendaia, Painesville and Ontusia series are similar soils in related families. Aurelie soils are less acid and formed in till derived from slates, phyllites and shales. Atherton, Fremont and Kendaia soils have a mesic temperature regime. Easton soils developed in metamorphosed limestone, calcareous sandstone and shale. Gulf soils are less acid and formed in water-sorted material. Hornellsville soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have a fine particle size control section. Painesville soils have a mesic temperature regime and formed in glaciofluvial material. Ontusia soils have a fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Almond soils are on broad hilltops and hillsides, and receive little runoff from adjacent areas. Surface shapes are plain to slightly convex, with slope gradients ranging from 0 to 40 percent. The soils developed in till derived from shale, siltstone, and some sandstone. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C. (39 to 48 degrees F.); mean annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm. (32 to 70 inches); and the mean annual frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 meters (1394 to 3600 feet) above sea level."

The Gretor, Hawksnest and Mongaup soils occur on bedrock controlled landscapes and have bedrock at within 40 in of the surface. Lewbath and Willdin soils are on nearby landscapes where the soil contains a fragipan horizon. Norchip soils are poorly drained. Salamanca soils are moderately well drained."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is the frigid equivalent of the mesic Fremont series. This soil now classifies in the subgroup of Aeric Endoaquepts. Competing series are expected to change as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 25 to 81 cm (10 to 32 in) (Bw horizons)\n3. Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime, and evidence of wetness that includes 2 chroma ped faces and iron depletions in the zone from 43 to 81 cm (17 to 32 in) (Bw2 horizon).\n4.  Estimated CEC activity class as semiactive from similar soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Almond series can be found at the NCSS Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
