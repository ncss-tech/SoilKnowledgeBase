  "OVERVIEW": "The Ardlon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and sedimentary rocks.  Ardlon soils are on flood plains and drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
