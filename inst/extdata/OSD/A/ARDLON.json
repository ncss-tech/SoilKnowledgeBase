(???)\nEndosaturation: The presence saturated zone at 4 to 6 feet during the months of March to July.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nThe surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, \"Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979.\"\nADDITIONAL DATA:  These soils have been correlated to riparian sites in Utah.  The particle-size classification was based on the weighted average of the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
