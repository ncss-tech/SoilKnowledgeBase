  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Crowley series.  The series type location was moved from Harris County to Jefferson County in 1995.  A study of the series in 1994 indicated that 2 to 3 series concepts have been mapped into the Aris series.  This revision limits the series to the original concept of the series.  New series will be proposed to define the Aris soils mapped on mounded and depressional positions.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 26 cm (0 to 10 in) (A and AE horizons).\nArgillic horizon: 26 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 horizons).\nAquic moisture regime: Dominant chroma of 2 or less and iron accumulations due to wetness in the A and AE horizons from January to March in normal years.\nAdditional Comments: The previous versions of the Aris series were classified as Typic Glossaqualfs. During the update of MLRA 150A, it was determined that previously identified glossic material was dominantly crawfish krotovinas. The particle-size family was changed from fine to fine-silty as the result of lab data on pedons throughout the series province.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  KSSL data exists on pedon S11TX2452366 from the type location in Jefferson County, Texas.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
