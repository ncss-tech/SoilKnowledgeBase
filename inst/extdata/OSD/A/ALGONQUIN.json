    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Algonquin soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in silty and clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 or 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 90 to 140 days. Elevation is 183 to 396 meters (600 to 1,300 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Negwegon and Springport soils. The moderately well drained Negwegon and poorly drained Springport soils are in a drainage sequence with Algonquin soils. Negwegon soils do not have redox depletions and occur on higher positions on the landscape. Springport soils have a mollic epipedon, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on lower positions on the landscape."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) from October through May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is high or very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Permeability is very slow."
