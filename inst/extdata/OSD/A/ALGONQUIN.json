  "OVERVIEW": "The Algonquin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",

Springport soils have a mollic epipedon, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on lower positions on the landscape."
