  "OVERVIEW": "The Alwilda series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in loamy overwash sediments overlying gravelly sand.  These soils are on terraces and glacial outwash plains.  Permeability is moderatlely rapid in the solum and rapid in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates and the underlying gravelly sand typically ranges from 20 to 30 inches, but can be as deep as 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 15 to 20 inches thick.  The soil has colors of the mollic epipedon to depths greater than 20 inches but it has less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.  The control section averages between 5 and 10 percent clay and contains less than 35 percent gravel by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam and ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand and ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon is multicolored layers of calcareous sand and gravel (15 to 45 percent gravel by volume).  It is gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, and very gravelly loamy sand but some pedons are loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the upper 4 to 10 inches and some pedons have thin lenses of silt loam, very fine sandy loam or coarse sand.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates as coatings on undersides of the gravel and sand."
