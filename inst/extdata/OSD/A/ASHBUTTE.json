  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashbutte series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in tephra from cinder cone volcanoes. Ashbutte soils are on cinder cone volcanoes in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches (1295 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5 degrees C).",
