It ranges up to 6,000 feet in the foothills of the mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in material derived from hard sandstone and shale.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 130 days.  It ranges down to 70 days in the foothills of the mountains."
