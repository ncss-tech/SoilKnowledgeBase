  "OVERVIEW": "The Amherst series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from hard shale and sandstone.  These soils are on uplands, hills, sedimentary plains and strath terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
