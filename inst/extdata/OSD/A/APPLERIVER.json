  "OVERVIEW": "The Appleriver series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 75 to 127 centimeters (30 to 50 inches) of loess and in residuum from calcareous shale. These soils are on treads and risers of structural benches and rounded ridges on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches).",
