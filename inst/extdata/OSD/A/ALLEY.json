Allor soils lack carbonates within a depth of 100 cm.  Cleghorn soils contain less than 15 percent coarse fragments. Chime and Igert soils are less than 100 cm deep to bedrock.  Glyphs soils have thick continuous weakly cemented layers extending below 100 cm.  Nevador soils have argillic horizons that contain less than 15 percent rock fragments and have Bqk horizons with durinodes in a friable matrix. Qwynn and Wedertz soils have an E horizon above the argillic horizon and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon. Wedlar soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon and are moistened for 10 to 20 days in July and August by convection storms.  Zevadez soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments and have carbonates at 60 to 90 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alley soils are on mountain and foothill shoulders and side slopes, plateaus, and fan piedmont remnant summits adjacent to hills and mountains.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, basalt and tuffs with some influence from loess. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,190 to 2,256 meters.  The climate is cool semiarid with warm dry summers, and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 100 to 120 days."
