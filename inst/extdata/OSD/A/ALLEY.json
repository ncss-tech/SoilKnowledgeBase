  "OVERVIEW": "The Alley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite, basalt and tuff with some influence from loess.  Alley soils are on side slopes and shoulders of low mountains, foothills, plateaus, and fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
