There are significant acres of soils mapped as Adel that have an ustic soil moisture regime.  These areas should be investigated in the future to determine if they should be correlated to the Houlihan series (ustic counterpart to Adel).\nAdditional Information\nSoil Interpretation Records: MT0075, MT0692, MT0831, MT1038.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
