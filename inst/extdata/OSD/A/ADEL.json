  "OVERVIEW": "The Adel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, mountain slopes, hills, landslides, stream terraces, drainageways and swales. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

There are significant acres of soils mapped as Adel that have an ustic soil moisture regime.  These areas should be investigated in the future to determine if they should be correlated to the Houlihan series (ustic counterpart to Adel).\nAdditional Information\nSoil Interpretation Records: MT0075, MT0692, MT0831, MT1038."
