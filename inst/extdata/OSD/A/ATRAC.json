  "OVERVIEW": "The Atrac series consists of deep, well drained, moderately soils that formed in loamy alluvial material derived from sandstone and shale.  Atrac soils are on upland hilly terrain and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section more than one-half of the time but less than three-fourths of the time, the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Forty to fifty percent of the total precipitation comes during July, August, September and October.  Less than 4 inches of precipitation is received in July and August and the SMCS is moist intermittently in some part during this period.  Twenty-five percent of the yearly precipitation comes in the 120 days following the winter solstice and the SMCS is moist in all parts for about 30 consecutive days during this period.  The base of the cambic horizon ranges from 6 to 35 inches in depth.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  Below the control section the texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons are stratified below the control section.  Atrac soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and does not have secondary carbonates.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 6.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
