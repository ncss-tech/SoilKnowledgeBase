  "OVERVIEW": "The Austonio series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments. These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep Pleistocene age terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1170 mm (46 in).",
