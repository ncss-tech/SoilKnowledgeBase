Coleman, Dry Creek, and Pritchard soils are greater than 150 cm to bedrock. Lasere soils have less than 10 percent rock fragment in the Bt horizon and lack layers of silica accumulation.  Pomponio soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and have chromas of 1 or 2 throughout. Succor soils are very deep. Tutuilla soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 cm."

Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Elevations are 1,130 to 1,605 meters.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 380 mm and the average annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is 90 to 125 days."
