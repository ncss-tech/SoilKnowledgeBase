  "OVERVIEW": "The Alibi series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from rhyolite and welded rhyolitic tuff.  The Alibi soils are on foothill sideslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 360 mm and average annual temperature is 8 degrees C.",
