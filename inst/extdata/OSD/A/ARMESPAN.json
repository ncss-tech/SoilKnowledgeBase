  "OVERVIEW": "The Armespan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Armespan soils are on fan remnants, inset fans, beach terraces, and ballenas. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
