  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ajolito series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, somewhat excessively drained soils on old stream terraces.  These soils formed in stream alluvium from mixed sources and eolian sediments.  Slope is 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches, the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
