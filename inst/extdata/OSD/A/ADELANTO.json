  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Adelanto soils have ochric epipedons and argillic subsurface horizons.  The solum thickness ranges from 32 to 86 inches, the great variation being due to differences in precipitation and the slow differential accretion of soil material.  Coarse fragments of gravel size may range from 1 to 35 percent throughout the profile; 1 to 10 percent fine gravels are common.  The soils are usually dry throughout the year.  Mean soil temperature ranges from about 65 to 71 F.  Mineralogy is mixed.\nA hues are usually 10YR and 7.5YR and include 5YR.  Chromas are 3 and 4 and may include 2; dry values are 5 and 6 and 4 moist.  Organic matter content is very low.  Textures of the A may be loamy sand or sandy loam; usually some coarse sand and fine gravel are noticeable.  The A may be massive, or may have weak plates near the surface.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.  Reaction may range from slightly acid to slightly alkaline except where soil manipulation or irrigation water has added lime.  An A3 or AB horizon is usually present or the boundary between A and Bt is not abrupt.\nColor of the Bt horizon is in hues of 7.5YR and 5YR with chromas of 3 to 6.  Textures are a sandy loam, but with less than 18 percent clay and at least 3 percent more clay than the A. Structure is usually weak.\nThe Bt may be massive or it may have weak to moderate angular blocky or even weak priamatic structure.  Dry consistence is hard.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Usually the Bt is noncalcareous at least in the upper part, but there is much variation and all or none may be calcareous.  Usually the uppermost lime is in the form of segregations or soft powdery secondary lime.\nThe C horizons are usually somewhat stratified coarse sandy loams, and loamy sands with some gravel and sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and usually the C is weakly calcareous.  Lenses with lime segragations and thin seams of weak lime cementation are common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chollawell, Cowspring and Lucerne soils. The Chollawell soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 64 degrees F. Cowspring soils are moderately deep to partially decomposed granodiorite bedrock. Lucerne soils do not have a Btk horizon and typically have an older buried Bt horizon with an upper boundary at about 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Adelanto soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans and plains.  The sediments are derived mostly from granite and closely related rocks.  The climate is arid.  Annual precipitation is about 4 to 9 inches.  Winters are cool with occasional gentle rains and a little snow.  Summer are hot with very infrequent thunder showers.  The mean air temperature is about 65 F; the average July temperature is about 82 F; the average January temperature is about 44 F.  The frost-free period is about 250 to 260 days.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,900 feet."
