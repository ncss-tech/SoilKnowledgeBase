  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for 105 to 120 consecutive days when the soil temperature at duripan contact is above 40 F. The mollic epipedon is 4 to 12 inches thick. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 30 percent sand-size pumice 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples, and 15 percent fine sand or coarser including pan fragments greater than 2.0mm, and field estimate of 4 to 10 percent clay. Depth to indurated duripan ranges from 4 to 20 inches. Basalt bedrock is at 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has a chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Duripan fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. It is a ashy very fine sandy loam, ashy fine sandy loam, or ashy sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. Basalt gravel and duripan fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and 0 to 3 percent cobbles. Some pedons have a Bk horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aarup soils are on upland summits, dissected hill slopes and toe slopes on basalt plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. They formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash and pumice from Glacier Peak over an indurated duripan. Elevation are 1,900 to 2,800 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 27 degrees F., average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
