  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to effervescent material ranges from 0 to 19 inches.  Depth to layers with greater than 15 percent exchangeable sodium is 4 to 10 inches.  The depth to the base of the Bt horizon is 15 inches or more.  A thin A horizon occurs in some pedons.  A light colored platy E horizon is generally present but is absent in some pedons. Gravel is typically less than 5 percent but ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The moisture control section is usually dry for 60 consecutive days during the 90 day period following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 195 days.  The soil has an aridic moisture regime that borders on ustic.\nThe E and A horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral through strongly alkaline.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos/cm.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam and has 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 5 to 45 percent sand.  This horizon is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline (pH 8.8 to 10.0), has 15 to 34 percent exchangeable sodium, and an EC of 4 to 16 mmhos/cm. Some pedons when buffered by gypsum are moderately alkaline.  The Btkn horizon, when present, has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 3 to 12 percent and an exchangeable sodium percent of 10 to 30.  A thin Bt horizon is present above the Btn in some pedons.  Some pedons have a Btkny horizon.\nThe Bkny horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.  Textures are clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline (pH 8.6 to 10.0).  This horizon contains 4 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Some pedons when buffered by gypsum are moderately alkaline.  Exchangeable sodium typically ranges from 10 to 30 percent but decreases with increasing depth. Electrical conductivity is 4 to 16 mmhos/cm.  Some pedons have a C horizon.\nSome pedons have a C horizon below 40 inches. It has properties similar to those of the Bkny horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Arvada soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, terraces and hillslopes.  The soils formed in moderately fine textured alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Elevations range from 2,600 to 6,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches but ranges from 9 to 14 inches with about half the precipitation occurring during April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature is about 43 to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 100 to 160 days."
