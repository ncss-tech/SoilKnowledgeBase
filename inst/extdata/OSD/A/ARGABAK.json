  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at the lithic contact ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are dry more than half of the time.   The mollic epipedon is 5 to 7 inches thick and includes all of or part of the argillic horizon.  The particle-size control section averages 23 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 2 percent. Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 4 to 12 inches. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has a value of 3 through 5 dry or moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry or moist and  chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is very or extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam or very cobbly loam.  This horizon has moderate fine subangular blocky to weak medium subangular blocky structure."

Bellehelen soils are dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 cumulative days between July and October and have moist chromas of 4 in the mollic epipedon.  Chinabutte, Clovercreek, Orhood and Windry soils are 14 to 20 inches to bedrock.  Duco soils lack silica coatings on the bedrock and have mollic epipedons 7 to 20 inches thick. Horseflat soils are 12 to 20 inches to a lithic contact.  Gwin soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Reywat soils have calcium carbonate coatings on the bedrock below the Bt2 horizon. Upatad soils have 5 to 15 percent silica concretions and lime coatings on rock fragments in the 2Btk horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Argabak soils are on ridgetops, summits, hillslopes, scablands, till plains, and benches and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed dominantly in loess and residuum weathered from basalt with some glaciated areas also having glacial till.   Elevations are 1,000 to 4,200 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 15 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 180 days."
