Patrole soils do not have vertic properties, have a contrasting particle-size control section and are on lower positions near streams.  Dalby and Verhalen soils have slickensides and are on similar or slightly lower positions.  Gila and Harkey soils average less than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section, and are on slightly lower positions nearer streams.  Pecos soils are on similar positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification was changed from fine, mixed (calcareous) thermic Vertic Torrifluvents to fine montmorillonitic, thermic Halic Haplotorrerts in 1993, based on reevaluation of the type location pedon and application of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  Based on NSSL sample No.  S93TX-475-001, mineralogy classification is changed from montmorillonitic to mixed mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches.  (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon - 8 to 80 inches. (B horizons)\nHalic feature - The soil has electrical conductivity greater than 15 dS/m in some horizons 6 inches thick or more within 40 inches of the surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory data from the type location, S93TX-475-001, Pedon 93P 416, Samples 93P 3097-3100.
