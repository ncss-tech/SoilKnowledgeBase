  "OVERVIEW": "The Aravaipa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from granite.  Aravaipa soils are on rolling hills and pediments and have slopes of 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about l6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
