    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0338.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 2 to 9 inches (A and part of Bw1 horizon); a cambic horizon from 4 to 19 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons; fragmental material from 19 to 60 inches (C horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2 and part of C horizon).  Arcette soils have a cryic soil temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Fragmental, mixed Ustic Eutrocryepts to Fragmental, mixed Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
