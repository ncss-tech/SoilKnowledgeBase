  "OVERVIEW": "The Arcette series consists of very deep, excessively drained, fragmental soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from acid igneous rock.  These soils are on ridge tops and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0338.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 2 to 9 inches (A and part of Bw1 horizon); a cambic horizon from 4 to 19 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons; fragmental material from 19 to 60 inches (C horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2 and part of C horizon).  Arcette soils have a cryic soil temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Fragmental, mixed Ustic Eutrocryepts to Fragmental, mixed Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified."
