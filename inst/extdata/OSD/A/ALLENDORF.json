  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Allendorf series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 75 to 100 centimeters of loess or silty and loamy alluvium over sandy sediments.  These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters.",
