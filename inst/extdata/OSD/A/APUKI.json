  "OVERVIEW": "The Apuki series consists of very shallow and shallow somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash deposited over basic pahoehoe lava. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual rainfall is 1,270 millimeters (50 inches), and the mean annual temperature is 23 degrees C. (73 degrees F.)",
