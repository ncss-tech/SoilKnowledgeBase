  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Albemarle series are deep and well drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in the weathered products of meta-arkosic sandstone.  These soils are on upland ridgetops and sideslopes of the northern Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F and annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

Content of rock fragments is 0\nto 15 percent in the solum, and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments consist dominantly of angular and subangular\ngravel of meta-arkosic sandstone, graywacke or quartzite.  The soil is very strongly or strongly acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.

Allegheny soils contain water worn rock fragments.  Allenwood, Arendtsville, Aura, Birdsboro, Chester, Collington, Elsinboro, Eubanks, Murrill, Shouns, and Thurmont soils have bedrock at a depth of more than 60 inches.  Bedington, Bucks, Butano, Frankstown, Gilpin, Leck Kill, Nixon, Rayne, Shelocta, and Ungers soils have fragments of shale in part of the solum.  Chetwynd soils formed in loess and loamy outwash.\nChilmark, and Meadowville soils have a lithologic discontinuity.  Clymer soils contain channery fragments of sandstone throughout\nthe soil.  Edgemont soils contain fragments of quartzite and\nquartz.  Edneytown soils are underlain with saprolite from gneiss, granite or schist rock.  Freehold soils contain glauconite.\nGlenelg soils have rock fragments dominated by mica schist and\nmica gneiss.  Quakertown soils contain fragments of siltstone and argillite.  Tate soils have rock fragments dominated by granite.  Syenite soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches of the surface.  Whiteford soils contain rock fragments of slate."
