  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches and is quite variable within short horizontal distances.  Content of rock fragments is 0\nto 15 percent in the solum, and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments consist dominantly of angular and subangular\ngravel of meta-arkosic sandstone, graywacke or quartzite.  The soil is very strongly or strongly acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has the same color range as the Bt horizon and commonly is mottled or streaked in shades of yellow, red, white, and brown.  It is sandy clay loam or loam.\nThe C horizon is highly variable in color and commonly contains shades of olive, gray, white, yellow, red and brown.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, and\ngravelly sandy loam, or it is highly weathered meta-arkosic\nsandstone that crushes to one of these textures."

Allegheny soils contain water worn rock fragments.  Allenwood, Arendtsville, Aura, Birdsboro, Chester, Collington, Elsinboro, Eubanks, Murrill, Shouns, and Thurmont soils have bedrock at a depth of more than 60 inches.  Bedington, Bucks, Butano, Frankstown, Gilpin, Leck Kill, Nixon, Rayne, Shelocta, and Ungers soils have fragments of shale in part of the solum.  Chetwynd soils formed in loess and loamy outwash.\nChilmark, and Meadowville soils have a lithologic discontinuity.  Clymer soils contain channery fragments of sandstone throughout\nthe soil.  Edgemont soils contain fragments of quartzite and\nquartz.  Edneytown soils are underlain with saprolite from gneiss, granite or schist rock.  Freehold soils contain glauconite.\nGlenelg soils have rock fragments dominated by mica schist and\nmica gneiss.  Quakertown soils contain fragments of siltstone and argillite.  Tate soils have rock fragments dominated by granite.  Syenite soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches of the surface.  Whiteford soils contain rock fragments of slate."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Albemarle soils are on nearly level to steep uplands of the northern Piedmont Plateau.  Gradients are typically less than 15 percent but the slope range includes 0 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from meta-arkosic sandstone with\nsmall amounts of mica schist and phyllite at elevations of less\nthan 1700 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 53 degrees to 59 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 45 inches."
