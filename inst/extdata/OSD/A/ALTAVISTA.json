With the update of the Wake County soil survey, the type location no longer exists.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 30 to 91 centimeters (12 to 36 inches (the Bt  horizons)\nAquic subgroup feature--redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less within the upper 61 centimeters (24 inches) of the argillic horizon"
