  "OVERVIEW": "The Alderson series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands.  These gently sloping to strongly sloping soils are forming in loamy oxidized overburden spoil placed by cross-pit spreaders during lignite surface mining operations.  Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches.",
