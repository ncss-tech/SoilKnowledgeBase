The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Estrada soils are fine-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on footslopes and toeslopes.  Sabroso soils are loamy-skeletal, do not have a mollic epipedon, and occur on steep south-facing backslopes.  Verano soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on steep north-facing backslopes.."
