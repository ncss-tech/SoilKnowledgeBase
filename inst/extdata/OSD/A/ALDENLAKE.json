The material is from the Rainy Lobe, or the Superior Lobe or is mixed from both sources and is of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 865 millimeters. Annual frost free days range from 110 to 185 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 185 to 640 meters."
