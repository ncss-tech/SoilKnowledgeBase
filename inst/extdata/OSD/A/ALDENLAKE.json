  "OVERVIEW": "The Aldenlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle and the underlying glacial outwash.  These soils are on outwash plains, moraines, eskers and drumlins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters.",
