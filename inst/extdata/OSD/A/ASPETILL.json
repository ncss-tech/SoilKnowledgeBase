  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aspetill soils are on moraines.  They typically occur on footslope positions.  They formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 9,200 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
