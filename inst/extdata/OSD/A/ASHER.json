  "OVERVIEW": "The Asher series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to slightly convex high flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies; MLRA 80A.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (62 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in).",
