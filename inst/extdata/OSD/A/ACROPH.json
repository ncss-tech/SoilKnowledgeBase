  "REVDATE": "08/2009",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Acroph series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in tephra over residuum from andesite, dacite and rhyodacite. Acroph soils are on scoured glacial-valley walls and floors and roche moutenees in the southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 107 inches (2718 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F (5 degrees C).",
