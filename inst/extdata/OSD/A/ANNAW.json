    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Labkey, Lyx, Pumper, and Toulon series.\nLabkey soils have noneffervescent matrix, lime occurs only on undersides of gravel. Lyx soils are not calcareous in the A and Bw horizons. Pumper and Toulon soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer. Also, Pumper soils have noncalcareous A and Bw horizons and the B horizon is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam and Toulon soils have relict oxide redox concentrations in the B and C horizons."
