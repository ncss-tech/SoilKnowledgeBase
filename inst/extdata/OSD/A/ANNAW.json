  "OVERVIEW": "The Annaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Annaw soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
