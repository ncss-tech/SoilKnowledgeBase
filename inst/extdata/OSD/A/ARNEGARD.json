  "OVERVIEW": "The Arnegard series consists of very deep, well or moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium on upland swales, terraces, fans and foot slopes.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 14 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to more than 30 inches in thickness and includes all or part of the Bw horizon. The soil typically has masses or disseminated carbonates within a depth of 40 inches but they range in depth from 16 to more than 60 inches.  The soil has less than 10 percent rock fragments throughout.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have BA horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam containing less than 30 percent clay.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically loam but includes fine sandy loam to clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  When present it has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It typically is loam but includes clay loam.\nBelow a depth of 30 inches textures of fine sandy loam and sandy loam are allowed and below a depth of 40 inches textures of loamy fine sand and silty clay loam are allowed."

Falkirk soils have a gravelly loam 2C horizon and glacial till within a depth of 40 inches.  Garlips and Roseglen soils have a calcic horizon.  In addition, Roseglen soils formed in lacustrine sediments. Shawa soils do not have Bw horizons and formed in alluvium primarily from igneous rocks."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in mixed, loamy alluvium from calcareous sedimentary beds or glacial till.  Slope typically is 1 or 2 percent but ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 34 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of which falls during spring and summer."

All of these soils, except Grail, Grassna and Parshall soils, have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Amor, Morton, Sen and Vebar soils formed in residual materials and are on nearby convex slopes.  Farland and Shambo soils are on nearby terraces.  Max, Williams and Temvik soils formed in glacial till.  Grail, Grassna and Parshall soils are on similar positions.  Grail soils are fine.  Grassna soils are fine-silty.  Parshall soils are coarse-loamy."
