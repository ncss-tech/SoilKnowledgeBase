  "OVERVIEW": "The Aval series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in cinders and eolian sand over welded tuff and basalt. Aval soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevation is 4,100 to 4,700 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The mollic colors in the Bw horizon are from the parent material.  The thickness of the solum and depth to hard bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments mainly as gravel size cinders and 5 to 18 percent clay.  A weathered bedrock layer overlies hard bedrock in some pedons.  It contains 40 to 85 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 0.25 mm size fraction.  Phosphate retention is 15 to 25 percent.  The acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.5 to 1.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel size cinders.\nThe Bw horizon is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly coarse sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 35 percent cinders.  Clay content is 5 to 18 percent.  It has 0.5 to 1.0 percent organic matter."
