  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arlynda soils are on backswamps, depressions, meander scars and low flood-plain steps on alluvial plains near the Pacific Ocean and along lower reaches of rivers and streams. Backswamps and meander scars form an intricate pattern in areas not leveled. These old channels are mostly cut off from the current tidal action by tide gates. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. The slopes greater than 5 percent are on meander scar sideslopes and are very short slopes. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Elevation is 0 to 50 meters (0 to 160 feet). The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters (35 to 80 inches). The mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."

Ferndale soils have redoximorphic features at a depth greater than 100 centimeters (40 inches), and occur on high flood-plain steps. Occidental soils are on depressions, meander scars, and reclaimed tidal marsh and have 35 to 40 percent clay in the particle size control section. Swainslough soils are on backswamps, depressions, low-flood-plain steps, and reclaimed tidal marshes on alluvial plains near the Pacific Ocean and have 35 to 45 percent clay in the particle size control section. Weott soils are on slightly higher backswamp, depression, and low flood-plain step positions than Arlynda soils and have the water table closer to the surface for shorter periods."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained; very high runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soils are occasionally flooded for brief periods December through February. The soils on 0 to 2 percent slopes are frequently ponded 1 to 60 centimeters deep for long periods December through April. Some fields are partially drained by ditches and protected from flooding by tide gates."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Arlynda soils were proposed in July of 1989 as fine-silty, mixed, nonacid, mesic Typic Fluvaquents.  Reclassification to fine-silty, nonacid, superactive, isomesic, Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts is based on changes in Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, and temperature data recorded in the survey area 2001 through 2004.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 36 centimeters (O and A horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 36 to 56 centimeters (Bg1 horizon).\n3. Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (A, Bg1 and Cg1 horizons).\nNASIS User Pedon 90CA600625\nSoil classified using Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
