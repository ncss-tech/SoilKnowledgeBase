  "OVERVIEW": "The Acree series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey slope alluvium derived from redbed sandstone or shale.  Acree soils are on alluvial fans and valley sides.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
