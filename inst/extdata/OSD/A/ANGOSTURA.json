  "OVERVIEW": "The Angostura series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from mixed rocks.  Angostura soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
