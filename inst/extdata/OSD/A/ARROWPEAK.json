  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arrowpeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from igneous and argillite rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and cuestas.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
