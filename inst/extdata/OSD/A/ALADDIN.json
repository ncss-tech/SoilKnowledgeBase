    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Aladdin soils are along the mountain fronts and on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts of Holocene age.  Slopes range from about 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in gravelly sediments derived mostly from monzonite and granite.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 14 to 18 inches with a marked summer maximum.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 57 to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 180 to 240 days."

Berino, Bucklebar, Caralampi, Onite, Pinaleno and Summerford soils have argillic horizons and do not have mollic epipedons.  Also, Berino and Bucklebar soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Caralampi, Pinaleno, and Santo Tomas soils are skeletal.  Hawkeye soils have sandy control sections.  Monza soils are shallow to highly weathered bedrock.  Onate soils have argillic horizons."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 14 inches (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 27 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Its revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nRecent evidence suggests soils within this precipitation zone and MLRA are moist in some part of the mollic epipedon less than 90 days (cumulative) and therefore do not meet the moisture requirements for a mollic epipedon.  Alternative subgroups are Ustic Torriorthents or Ustic Haplocambids.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nRevised for the correlation of White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; October, 2014, NMS\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
