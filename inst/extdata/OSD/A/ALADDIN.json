  "OVERVIEW": "The Aladdin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium derived mostly from monzonite and granite.  Aladdin soils are on mountain fronts, alluvial fans, and fan piedmonts of Holocene age.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 14 inches (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 27 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Its revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nRecent evidence suggests soils within this precipitation zone and MLRA are moist in some part of the mollic epipedon less than 90 days (cumulative) and therefore do not meet the moisture requirements for a mollic epipedon.  Alternative subgroups are Ustic Torriorthents or Ustic Haplocambids.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nRevised for the correlation of White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; October, 2014, NMS\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
