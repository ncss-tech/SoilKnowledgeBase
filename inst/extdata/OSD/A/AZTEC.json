  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location has been moved to the present location to better represent the present series concept. Aztec soils were formerly classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Typic Haplogypsids. The classification was revised in March of 2003 recognizing the calcic horizon above the gypsic and adding the CEC activity class using the second edition to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series were not checked at that time. -ET\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 3/2003.
