  "OVERVIEW": "The Aztec series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with a large component of gypsum.  The Aztec soils are on erosional fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",

Aztec soils were formerly classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Typic Haplogypsids. The classification was revised in March of 2003 recognizing the calcic horizon above the gypsic and adding the CEC activity class using the second edition to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series were not checked at that time. -ET\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 3/2003.
