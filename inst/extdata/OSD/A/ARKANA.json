  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 45 inches.  Reaction of the A, E, and BE horizons range from very strongly acid to neutral. The Bt and 2Bt horizons also range from very strongly acid to neutral, but can be mildly alkaline in the layer immediately above bedrock. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 60 percent in the A and E horizons; 15 to 60 percent in the BE horizon, and 0 to 40 percent in the Bt and 2Bt horizons. The particle-size control section has a weighted average of 60 to 85 percent clay, and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, or value of 4 and chroma of 4 to 6. Mottles are in shades of brown. It is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, gravelly silty clay loam, or their very gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt1 or 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt2 or 2Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, or value of 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is typically clay or gravelly clay, but can be silty clay in the layer immediately above bedrock.  Mottles are in shades of brown or red.\nThe R horizon is hard, level-bedded to undulating, dolomite or limestone."

They formed in gravelly colluvium and the underlying clayey residuum weathered from limestone or dolomite. Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 to 50 inches and is not evenly distributed during the year.  The mean annual temperature ranged from about 53 to 58 degrees F."

Agnos soils have a lower base saturation, have a paralithic contact from 40 to 60 inches, and are on similar landscape positions. Clarksville soils are loamy-skeletal, are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock, and are at higher elevations.  Doniphan soils have a lower base saturation, are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock, and are on similar landscape postions. Gassville soils have a lower base saturation, have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches, and are on similar landscape postions. Gepp soils have a lighter colored surface layer, are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock, and are on similar landscape postions. Nixa soils are loamy-skeletal, have a fragipan, and are at higher elevations. Noark soil are clayey-skeletal, are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock, and are at higher elevations.  Ventris soils have an abrupt textural change, and are on similar landscape postions."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches (A1, A2, E, and BE horizons)\n2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 27 inches\n3) Lithic contact - bedrock at 27 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available from the University of Arkansas Soil Characterization Laboratory on the typical pedon.\nThese soils are mapped in the Boone limestone, Cotter dolomite, and the Jefferson City dolomite formations in Arkansas and Missouri.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
