  "OVERVIEW": "The Ava series consists of moderately well drained soils on convex ridges and side slopes of drainageways on till plains. They formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits that overlie a strongly developed paleosol. They are moderately deep to a fragipan and greater than 80 inches to bedrock. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 millimeters (42 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.).",

Cincinnati, Hildebrecht and Solsberry soils have a horizon that contains 4 percent or more rock fragments within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Fountainville and Zanesville soils have a lithic contact within 203 cm (80 inches). Grantsburg and Hosmer soils average less than 10 percent sand to a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Omulga and Otwell soils have subhorizons in the lower part of the series control section that have as much as 50 percent sand. Otwood soils contain mica flakes throughout the series control section. Weisburg soils have more than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Boston soils average more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ava soils are on convex ridges, shoulders and backslopes on loess-covered dissected till plains. Slope gradients are 0 to 18 percent. Ava soils formed in 76 to 140 cm (30 to 55 inches) of loess (considered to be of Wisconsin age) and in the underlying silty or loamy deposits. The underlying deposits contain more sand than the overlying loess mantle and consist of erosional sediments or reworked material of the A horizon of the paleosol and an admixed amount of earliest Wisconsinan loess. Locally these soils often contain a band of pebbles of the Illinoian till concentrated by erosion. Ava soils are underlain, at a depth of about 122 to 2136 centimeters (4 to 7 feet), by a strongly developed paleosol considered to be from the Illinoian till stage. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C. (50 to 58 degrees F.), the mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1143 mm (38 to 45 inches), frost free period ranges from 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 106 to 267 meters (350 to 875 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Bluford soils are on higher lying broader summits or lower lying backslopes. The well drained Hickory soils do not have a fragipan and are on lower lying backslopes. The well drained Parke soils do not have a fragipan, have redder colors, and lower base saturation in the lower part of the solum, and are on similar convex ridges of eskers, kames, outwash plains. The poorly drained Wynoose soils are on flats of the till plains. The Bluford and Wynoose soils form a hydrosequence with Ava soils. In Indiana the Ava soils are also associated with the well drained Cincinnati, moderately well drained Shakamak, and the somewhat poorly drained Vigo soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) above the fragipan and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the fragipan and below. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and very slow in the fragipan. Depth to an intermittent perched high water table is at 46 to 106 cm (1.5 to 3.5 feet) from January through April in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: We now believe that the illuvial layer of the lower sequum (B't horizon) is the main part of the argillic horizon, and that the part of the solum that meets the current definition of a fragipan horizon is below the B't horizon. Horizon designations have been adjusted to reflect this thinking. Water is perched on the B't horizon or on the fragipan, and free water flows laterally through or above the B/E horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches), (Ap, E, and BE horizons);\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 36 to 130 cm (14 to 50 inches), (Bt, Bt/E, B't, 2Btx1 and 2Btx2 horizons);\nFragipan - the zone from 86 to 130 cm (34 to 50 inches), (2Btx1 and 2Btx2 horizons);\nUdic moisture regime;\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for several pedons are on file at the Illinois state office. Engineering test data for the typical pedon is published in\nthe Soil Survey of Edwards and Richland Counties, Illinois. Also lab data from Indiana is on file at the Major Land Resource Area Office (MO11) at Indianapolis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
