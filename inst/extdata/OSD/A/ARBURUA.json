  "OVERVIEW": "The Arburua series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on foothills, hills and mountains. These soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale. Slope is 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F. and is more than 47 degrees F from February 15 to December 15. The moisture control section of 6 to 18 inches is moist throughout from about December 1 to May 1 and dry throughout from about July 1 to October 31 of each year, about 120 days. Accelerated erosion has resulted in the loss of 25 to 75 percent of the original surface in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/4. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4 or 5/4. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent. Texture is loam or clay loam. Clay percent is 18 to 30 percent. It is strongly or violently effervescent. Some pedons do not have soft masses of carbonates. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent. Gravel content is 0 to 10 percent. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has color of 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4 or 7/4.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arburua soils are on the mountain side slopes, ridge tops and escarpments of foothills, hills and mountains. Slope is 2 to 75 percent. Soils with slopes of 2 to 15 percent are commonly on strath terraces. The underlying sandstone or shale of the Moreno and Panoche Formation is soft and fractured for 1 to 6 inches becoming extremely hard with increasing depth. The fractures are up to 1.5 inches wide and filled with soil and root material. The rock is too hard to dig with hand tools within 40 inches of the surface. Elevation is 200 to 3,670 feet. The climate is dry, mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 15 inches. Mean January temperature is 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is 73 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F. Frost-free season is 190 to 280 days."

Apollo soils, on low foothills, have a mollic epipedon and a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Ayar soils, on foothills, have a fine particle-size control section and have wide deep cracks when dry. Bapos soils, on terraces and fan remnants, are very deep and have a fine particle-size control section. Conosta soils, on foothills, have an argillic horizon and a fine particle-size control section. Los Banos soils, on terraces and fan remnants, have an argillic horizon and a fine particle-size control section. Oneil soils, on foothills, have a mollic epipedon and a fine-silty particle-size control section. San Timoteo soils, on low foothills, have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Wisflat soils, on foothills, hills and mountains, have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches."
