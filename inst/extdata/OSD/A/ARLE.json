  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are typically calcareous throughout, but are leached of carbonates to a depth of 7 to 15 inches in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are mainly small flat fragments and flagstones.  The control section is typically very stony loam, but ranges from very stony sandy loam to very stony sandy clay loam.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Arle soils are on steeply sloping ridges and hills.  Slopes are 12 to more than 65 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from underlying redbed shale and sandstone.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches generally evenly distributed throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, the summer temperature is about 63 degrees F.  The frost- free season is about 95 days."

Morval soils have an argillic horizon and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section."
