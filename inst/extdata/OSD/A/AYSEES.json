  "OVERVIEW": "The Aysees series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Aysees soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to l2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
