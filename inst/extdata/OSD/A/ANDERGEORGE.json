  "OVERVIEW": "The Andergeorge series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in gravelly alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on Piedmont slopes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
