  "OVERVIEW": "The AIDO series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from calcareous shale or fine grained sandstone.  AIDO soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.",

When described on April 4, 1977, the soils was slightly moist below 1 inch).\nA--0 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Cracks wider than 1 cm extend from the surface to a depth of 20 inches or to the paralithic contact.  The cracks close some time in December to March for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  None to a few weak slickenslides were observed.  It was assumed they would intersect.  Some minor gilgai is present.  Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 60  to 64 degrees F.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline (pH 7.4 to 8.4).  Depth to carbonates ranges from 8 to 40 inches.  This series lacks a calcic horizon.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  Structure ranges from weak platy to strong angular blocky. Where plowed, structure is granular to angular blocky.  It is noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.  Clay content is 30 to 55 percent.  Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Bssk horizon has dry and moist colors similar to the A horizon.  It is silty clay, or clay.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Structures ranges from weak coarse angular blocky to strong very coarse prismatic structure.  Some pedons are structureless.  It is slightly to violently effervescent with segregated lime ranging from fine to medium soft masses or filaments.  Clay content is 40 to 60 percent."

Alo and Bosanko soils have cracks that are closed for more than 90 days.  Altamont and Auld soils have paralithic contact more than 40 inches deep.  The Cropley, Myers, Porterville, and Sehorn soils lack a paralithic contact.  Cibo and Sehorn soils have a lithic contact.  Diablo soils have a chroma of 1 in the upper 12 to 30 inches. Vaquero soils have cracks that close for 100 to 150 consecutive days and have common intersecting slickenslides."
