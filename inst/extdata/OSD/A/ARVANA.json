    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for crop production but also used as native rangeland and wildlife habitat. Principal crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax vegetation is mainly short and mid grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate, with a smaller tall grass compliment. This site is dominated by blue grama with lesser amounts of sideoats grama, buffalograss, little bluestem, gauras, plains zinnia, prairieclover, bundleflower, and wild alfalfa, and ephedra. Woody plants include catclaw sensitivebrier, yucca, and sand sagebrush. Dominant vegetation on the loamy fine sands is sideoats grama, bluestems, and switchgrass, while on the fine sandy loams is sideoats grama, blue grama, buffalograss, and Arizona cottontop. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077CY036TX) and Sandy (R077CY035TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C."
