Carrolis series have developed in recent volcanic material (dredge material St. Helens) and have 5 to 20 percent glass. Conrad soils are very poorly drained.  Dair soils have a much Oa horizon up to 8 inches thick.  Forbar are very poorly drained and are fine sand throughout the profile.  Gothenburg have gravelly textures within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Junius soils are in a more moist humid climate regime.  Norway soils are calcareous throughout.  Strafford soils are extremely acid to slightly acid.  Tryon soils have a solum less than 6 inches thick.  Tyre soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Wanser soils have a soil temperature of 51 or 54 degrees F and are moderately or strongly alkaline."
