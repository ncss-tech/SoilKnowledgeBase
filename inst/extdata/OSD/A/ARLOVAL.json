Carrolis series have developed in recent volcanic material (dredge material St. Helens) and have 5 to 20 percent glass. Conrad soils are very poorly drained.  Dair soils have a much Oa horizon up to 8 inches thick.  Forbar are very poorly drained and are fine sand throughout the profile.  Gothenburg have gravelly textures within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Junius soils are in a more moist humid climate regime.  Norway soils are calcareous throughout.  Strafford soils are extremely acid to slightly acid.  Tryon soils have a solum less than 6 inches thick.  Tyre soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Wanser soils have a soil temperature of 51 or 54 degrees F and are moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in stratified sandy alluvium from mixed sources and high in quartz. The climate is semiarid with relatively dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches. The frost-free period is 125 to 140 days.  The averate annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F."

Decker soils have loamy control sections and calcic horizons, and lack the wetness and colors of the Aquents. Quincy and Tindahay soils lack the wetness and colors of the Aquents. Schodson soils have moderately coarse textures to depths of 25 to 35 inches."
