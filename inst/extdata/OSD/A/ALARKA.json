Depth to the 2C horizon that contains more than 35 percent by volume gravel, cobbles, and /or stones  is 20 to 40 inches.  Content of mica flakes is few or common. Reaction is ultra acid to very strongly acid depending upon vegetative cover.\nThe O horizons range from 4 to 10 inches thick and may appear as a thick root mat.  Extent and type of vegetative cover influences the thickness of the O horizons.\nThe A horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to  2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture of the Btg horizon is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The texture of the Bt horizon is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present,  has a hue of 10YR or 2.5 Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture of the Cg horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons may have a C horizon that does not have a reduced matrix.  This horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 6 or 8.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alarka soils are on gently or strongly sloping colluvial footslopes in hanging coves in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). Normally located in the upper reaches of watersheds, these hanging coves occur where the landscape is relatively wide for some distance before narrowing at a lower elevation.  Seeps and springs also are common features of these areas.  Alarka soils formed in colluvium and the underlying skeletal alluvial strata deposited by high energy flooding events.  Microrelief is hummocky on the gently sloping portions of these hanging coves, and Alarka soils are commonly on the higher portions of these areas. The elevation ranges from 2,500 feet to 5,000 feet. Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 70 inches. Slope ranges from 3 to 15 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cataloochee, Cheoah, Chestnut, Cullasaja, Edneyville, Guyot, Jeffrey, Oconaluftee, Plott,  Santeetlah, Soco, Spivey, Stecoah, Tuckasegee, Wayah, Wesser, Whiteoak, and Whiteside series.  Of these, only Wesser and Whiteside soils are found in hanging coves.  Wesser soils are very poorly drained, in a sandy or sandy skeletal particle size family, and are on lower, nearly level parts of hummocks.  Whiteside soils are moderately well drained and on similar landscapes in more sloping parts of hanging coves.  Cataloochee, Guyot, Oconaluftee, and Wayah soils are on ridges and side slopes in frigid temperature regimes.   Cheoah, Chestnut, Edneyville, Jeffrey, Plott, Soco, and Stecoah soils are on ridges and side slopes in mesic temperature regimes.   Cullasaja, Santeetlah, Spivey, Tuckasegee, and Whiteoak soils are well drained and on benches, foot slopes, toe slopes, drainageways, and fans in nearby coves, which are not covered in rhododendron thickets."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; moderately slow or slow permeability in the upper horizons and moderately rapid permeability in the lower horizons.  Permeability in the upper part is largely influenced by the contact between the thick organic mat with the mineral soil.  At this contact, the differences in pore size distribution between these two layers result in a slowing of water movement.   Redoximorphic features from groundwater moving through the lower part are not as pronounced due to the skeletal nature of the underlying strata.  These two conditions commonly result in an oxidized matrix within the Bt horizon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  All of the acreage is in woodland, primarily in National Forest or in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  These areas are of great habitat importance to amphibians, especially salamanders.  The dominant vegetative cover is rhododendron thicket, which provides shading and moisture retention for the development of the thick organic mat.  Evergreen trees such as hemlock, white pine, and red spruce are common overstory species."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Soils of the Alarka series were mapped as part of the Humaquepts map unit in the Haywood County Area, NC Soil Survey.  However, due to the small size and variability of the map units, no series were established.  Alarka soils are mainly mapped in a complex with the very poorly drained Wesser series.  Some soils may have a frigid temperature regime.  However, the small extent and unique properties of these soils do not warrant a separation of series based on temperature at this time.  This soil was sampled and analyzed by the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, NE;  Sample number  S99NC-173-001.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) adjusted OSD to reflect Lab Data\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon  0 to 10 inches (Oe, Oa, and A horizons)\nArgillic horizon  10 to 21 inches (Btg and Bt horizons)\nAeric subgroup feature  13 to 21 inches (Bt horizon) the zone which has matrix chroma of more than 3 in one or more horizons between 10 inches from the mineral soil surface and 30 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
