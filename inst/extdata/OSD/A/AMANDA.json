The moderately well drained Centerburg soils, somewhat poorly drained Bennington soils, and the very poorly drained Condit and Pewamo soils are in a toposequence with Amanda soils. They are in lower topographic positions or are on less sloping areas along drainageways. Bogart, Chili, and Jimtown soils are on nearby areas of gravelly outwash. Loudonville and Mechanicsburg soils are on areas where sandstone or siltstone is moderately deep and deep, respectively."
