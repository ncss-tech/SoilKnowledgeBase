  "OVERVIEW": "The Alamuchee Series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on floodplains and stream terraces in the Southern Coastal Plain.  They formed in loamy alluvial deposits.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The soil contains less than 5 percent coarse fragments throughout and is very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout the solum, except for surface layers that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4.  Where value and chroma is 3 or less, thickness of the A horizon is less than 7 inches.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a buried A horizon with the same hue, value, chroma, and texture as the A horizon.  This horizon, where present is as much as 12 inches thick and is at a depth of 12 to 36 inches below the surface.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Some pedon have mottles of brown, yellow or gray below a depth of 30 inches.  Texture is dominately loam or sandy clay loam; but some pedons have a thin layer of clay loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent and silt content ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  Some pedons have a buried Bt horizon below a depth of about 25 inches.  Where present, this horizon has the same hue, value, chroma, and texture as the Bw horizon.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has the same hue, value, chroma, and texture as the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6 with mottles in shades of red, brown, or gray; or it is mottled in varying shades of red, brown, and gray.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and commonly is stratified with these textures."
