The somewhat poorly drained Thetford  and the poorly drained Granby soils are very deep sandy soils that are next to Avoca soils where the till borders lacustrine areas."

Cropped areas are planted to corn, small grain and hay. Some small woodlots remain and have second growth stands of elm, soft maple, aspen and white birch. Native vegetation is mixed northern hardwoods and white pine."

These areas require further study to characterize the cementing agent and soil chemistry of the profile.\nA dense substratum phase is recognized.\nA phase with a surface layer of human transported materials has been correlated. This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable textures.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
