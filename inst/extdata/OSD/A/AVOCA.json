  "OVERVIEW": "The Avoca series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy glaciolacustrine deposits over loamy till. Avoca soils are on till-floored lake plains, till plains, water-lain moraines, wave-worked till plains, nearshore zones and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 817 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

These areas require further study to characterize the cementing agent and soil chemistry of the profile.\nA dense substratum phase is recognized.\nA phase with a surface layer of human transported materials has been correlated. This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable textures."
