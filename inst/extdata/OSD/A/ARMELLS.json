  "OVERVIEW": "The Armells series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from baked sandstone and shale (scoria).  These soils are on hills and terrace risers.  Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
