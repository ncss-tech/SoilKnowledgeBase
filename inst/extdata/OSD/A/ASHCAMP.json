    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ashcamp soils are on plateaus. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks of pyroclastic origin.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 2,000 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
