    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aurelius soils are in depressional areas of lake plains, outwash plains, and till plains. They range in size from about 3 to 200 acres. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The climate is humid continental. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 889 mm (24 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colwood, Edwards, Houghton, Lamson, Martisco and Palms soils. Colwood and Lamson soils lack histic epipedons and marly materials. Edwards, Houghton and Palms soils have thicker organic layers. Martisco soils are deeper to mineral 2C horizons."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the muck material; variable in the marly material and coprogenous material, and moderately high in the mineral substrata. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the muck, variable in the marly material and coprogenous material, and moderate in the mineral substrata."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Aurelius soils are drained and used for cultivated crops. Principal crops are corn, soybeans and specialty crops such as potatoes, carrots and onions. Some areas remain in native vegetation of hardwood forest consisting of ash, red maple, silver maple and cottonwood, water-tolerant shrubs or grasses and sedges."
