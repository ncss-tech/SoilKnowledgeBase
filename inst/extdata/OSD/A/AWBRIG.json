The lithologic discontinuity represents a change in parent material from alluvium deposited by the Willamette River and its tributaries to Missoula Flood sediment.\n8/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). Most of the changes were in formatting. The competing series were updated, and the classification was updated from Vertic Albaqualfs to Chromic Vertic Albaqualfs. The high value of the Ap horizon when dry meets the criteria for Chromic Vertic Albaqualfs in the twelfth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data--pedon number S65-Oreg-20-1, Oregon State University, unpublished; soil survey sample number S99OR-043-004, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
