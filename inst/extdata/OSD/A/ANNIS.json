    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 46 degrees F. The soils are mildly or moderately alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.4). Commonly the soil below depth of 20 inches is stratified silty clay loam, silt loam and fine sandy loam. The soil is usually moist except it is dry in all parts of the 4- to 12-inch depth for more than 45 consecutive days in late summer in more than 7 out of 10 years. The soil control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. The profile has an irregular decrease in organic carbon to a level of 0.1 to 0.3 percent within 50 inches of the surface. Mottles are commonly below depth of 20 inches. A fluctuating water table occurs at depths of 3 to 5 feet.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y. Some pedons include strata of loam and sandy loam."
