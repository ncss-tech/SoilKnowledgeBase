  "OVERVIEW": "The Abersito series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvial and alluvial sediments derived from mixed sources.  Abersito soils are on hills and mesas.  Slope is 5 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
