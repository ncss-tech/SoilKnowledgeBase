  "OVERVIEW": "The Aguena series consists of very deep, excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments derived dominantly from mixed sources.  Aguena soils are on rolling dunes on hills.  Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

Elevation ranges from 4,200 feet to 5, 800 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 170 to 240 days.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April."
