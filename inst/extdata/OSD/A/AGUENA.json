  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Elevation ranges from 4,200 feet to 5, 800 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 170 to 240 days.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April."
