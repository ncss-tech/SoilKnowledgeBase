  "OVERVIEW": "The Armydrain series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Armydrain soils are on flood plains and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
