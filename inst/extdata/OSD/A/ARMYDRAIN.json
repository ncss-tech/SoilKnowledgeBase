  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Armydrain soils are on flood plains and lake plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and influenced by volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent and are generally less than one percent.  Elevations are 1,185 to 1,295 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm; mean annual air temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
