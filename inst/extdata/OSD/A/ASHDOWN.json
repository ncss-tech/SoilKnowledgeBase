  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashdown series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, shale, and limestone.  Ashdown soils are on alluvial fans and alluvial plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The moisture control section is continually dry in all parts for 60 to 75 days during the summer, and is continually moist in all parts for 60 to 75 days during the winter and early spring.  The moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe 10 to 40 inch series particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse-fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe Ap and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam, sandy loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Some pedons have less than 3 percent gypsum in the C horizon. Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 16 mmhos/cm in the lower part of the C horizon."
