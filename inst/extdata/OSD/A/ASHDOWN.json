    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at depths of 20 inches ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 67 to 71 degrees F.  The moisture control section is continually dry in all parts for 60 to 75 days during the summer, and is continually moist in all parts for 60 to 75 days during the winter and early spring.  The moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe 10 to 40 inch series particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse-fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe Ap and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam, sandy loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Some pedons have less than 3 percent gypsum in the C horizon. Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 16 mmhos/cm in the lower part of the C horizon."

These soils formed in alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, shale, limestone, conglomerate and igneous rock.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."
