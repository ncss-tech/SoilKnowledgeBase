  "OVERVIEW": "The Aquinas series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granodiorite.  Aquinas soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
