Cherry Spring soils have dominantly silt loam argillic with a large component of loess high in ash and glass. Eastval soils have a subhorizon with 35 to 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Spasprey soils have a Bk horizon above a duripan at a depth of 50 to 75 cm.  Yody soils are moderately alkaline and have a calcic horizon above the duripan. Zaidy soils are less than 76 cm to the duripan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aquinas soils are on fan remnants.  They have formed in a mantle of alluvium derived from granodiorite superimposed over valley-fill materials containing tuff and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
