  "OVERVIEW": "The Ainakea series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash over material weathered from basalt.  Ainakea soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 100 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1,905 millimeters (75 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C. (72 degrees F.)",
