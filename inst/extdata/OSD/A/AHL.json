  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 47 degrees to about 50 degrees F. These soils are usually moist and are not dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for as much as 60 consecutive days or in some part for as much as 90 cumulative days. The soils are moderately acid to slightly acid. The solum is 20 to 36 inches thick. Depth to consolidated basalt bedrock is 24 to 40 inches. Content of coarse fragments in the control section is 50 to 90 percent. The Bir horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist. The B3 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 4 through 6 moist. It is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam.  The C horizon contains more than 80 percent fractured basalt bedrock, with voids filled with material similar to that of the B3 horizons."

Alderwood, Dabob, Hoodsport, Sinclair, and Whidbey soils have paralithic or lithic contacts within 40 inches. Beausite soils have gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam control sections. Cathcart soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section and contain less than 50 percent coarse fragments in some part of the control section. Everett soils have 10YR or 7.5YR hue in the B horizon. Klaus soils have coarse apparent field textures. Olete soils have solums thinner than 20 inches."

They occur in a mild, cool marine climate having an annual precipitation of 50 to 100 inches, most of which falls as rain during the fall, winter, and spring months; mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.; the average summer temperature is about 60 degrees F.; the average winter temperature is about 36 degrees F.; and the frost-free period is 160 to 190 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft is a reformat only of a 1971 description.  The classification is tentative.  Soils in the area forming from basalt have failed to meet chemical criteria for spodisols.  These soils are probably Andic Dystrochrepts or Entic Dystrandepts.  The soils at elevations above about 1,800 feet probably have a \"frigid\" temperature regime.\nClassification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  The range of this soil appears to be both in the Xeric and Udic soil moisture regimes (3/24/94).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
