  "OVERVIEW": "The Amtoft series consists of shallow, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from calcareous sedimentary rocks. Amtoft soils are on hills, mountains and ridges. Slopes range from 4 to 80 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
