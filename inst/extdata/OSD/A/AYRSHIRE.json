In drained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. In undrained areas, the depth ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum, and moderately high to very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum, and moderate to rapid in the substratum."
