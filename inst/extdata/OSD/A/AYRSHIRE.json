  "OVERVIEW": "The Ayrshire consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in eolian materials. Ayrshire soils are on stream terraces and interdunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

In undrained areas, the depth ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum, and moderately high to very high in the substratum.
