  "BYREV": "Rev. WEH-JDV-PSP",
  "REVDATE": "06/2010",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Aurora series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in till. They are nearly level through very steep soils on dissected upland plateaus and bedrock-controlled till plains. Bedrock is at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral surface layer and moderately low to moderately high in the subsoil. Slope ranges from 0 through 75 percent. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 through 30 percent in the A horizons and, from 2 through 35 percent, in the subsoil and substratum. Rock fragments are dominantly channers of shale, with some gravels or cobbles of siltstone, limestone, and sandstone. The soil ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the A horizon, moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the B horizon, and neutral through moderately alkaline in the C horizon, commonly becoming less acid with increasing depth.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky and consistence is very friable or friable. Some pedons have a BA horizon just below the A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, values of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky or platy and consistence is friable or firm. B/E horizons have colors and textures similar to the respective Bt and E horizons.\nSome pedons have an E/B horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 3 or 4. Redoximorphic features are present. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam, and percent of clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent. It has angular, or subangular blocky, to prismatic structure and firm or very friable to consistence.\nThe BC horizon is similar to the Bt horizon except that clay films are less readily evident. In some pedons the BC horizon is replaced by, or underlain by, a C horizon which is massive or has plate like divisions.\nThe 2R horizon is dominantly horizontally bedded shale bedrock, but include some beds of siltstone, sandstone or limestone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Conesus, Danley, Grindstone, and Nunda series are members of the same family. All of these soils are more than 40 inches deep over bedrock.\nThe Angola, Benson, Farmington, Galway, Lairdsville, Manlius, Palatine, Riga, Wassaic, and Wilpoint series are members of similar families. Angola soils are wetter and have low chroma colors in the Bt horizon. Benson and Farmington soils are less than 20 inches thick over bedrock. Galway, Manlius, and Palatine soils lack argillic horizons. Lairdsville, Riga, and Wilpoint soils are finer textured in the solum. Wassaic soils have rock fragments in the soil dominated by limestone."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Aurora soils are nearly level through very steep soils in uplands where the till mantle is less than 40 inches thick over bedrock. Slope ranges from 0 through 75 percent. The soils formed in till mainly from shale similar to the underlying bedrock, but some areas are underlain by siltstone, limestone, and sandstone, commonly interbedded with shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 degrees through 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 45 inches, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 130 through 180 days. Elevation ranges from 350 thrrough 1500 feet above sea level."
