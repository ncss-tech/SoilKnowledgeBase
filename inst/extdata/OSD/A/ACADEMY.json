  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils have ochric epipedons (less than 1 percent O.M.), argillic horizons and are dry for 60 consecutive days in all parts between 10 to 40 inches.  The soils have mean annual temperatures greater than 59 F, and mixed mineralogy.  The solum thickness ranges from 19 to 39 inches.  The A horizons range in color from brown to dark brown, in 10YR and 7.5YR hues with values of 4 and 5 and chromas of 3 and 4; moist colors are dark brown with values of 3 and chromas of 2 and 3; in texture from loam to clay loam; in reaction from medium to slightly acid.  The Bt horizons range in color from reddish brown, brown, dark brown, or strong brown in 5YR and 7.5YR hues with values of 4 and 5 and chromas of 3 and 4; moist colors are dark reddish brown to dark brown in 5YR and 7.5YR hues with values of 3 and 4 and chromas of 2 to 4; in texture from sandy clay loam to clay loam; in reaction from slightly acid to neutral.  The soils have medial development with over 10 percent clay increase from A to B and the B has moderate to strong angular blocky structure.  The C horizon is massive with some vertical cracks, very hard to extremely hard dry, but slakes on wetting.  The C is poorly sorted, weakly to moderately consolidated terrestrial sandstone.  It is impermeable to roots and water."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include in the same family the Whitney soils which have brown A horizons and light yellowish brown Bt horizons over massive weakly consolidated granitic sediments.  Other series in the same family lack the consolidated C horizon.  Soils in the same group include Chualar which have umbric epipedons and are formed in granitic alluvium.  Similar soils are the Cometa soils which have clay argillic horizons and abrupt AB boundaries; Kimball soils which have clay argillic horizons; Rocklin soils which have argillic horizons underlain by a duripan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Academy soils occur on undulating to rolling hills formed from the dissection of old valley fill material from mixed rock sources.  They occur at elevation of 400 to 500 feet in a semiarid, mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 13 to 15 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 F, average January temperature about 45 F, and average July temperature about 80 F.  Frost-free season averages about 280 days."
