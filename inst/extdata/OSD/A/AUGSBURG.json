  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Augsburg series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in a mantle of calcareous, silty glaciolacustrine sediments over calcareous, clayey glaciolacustrine sediments or glacial till on glacial lake plains.  These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and slow or very slow permeability in the lower part.  They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness.  Depth to the clayey material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils do not have rock fragments in the upper part of the 10- to 40-inch series control section but have up to 5 percent in the clayeye sediments in the lower part.  These soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and are slightly effervescent to violently effervescent to a depth of 40 inches or more.  In the particle-size control section the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent; the higher values are in the Bkg horizon.  The upper sediment averages less than 18 percent noncarbonate clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  The lower sediment typically averages between 45 and 55 percent clay with an extreme range of 35 to 85 percent clay.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Mucky analogues of these textures occur in the depressional phases.  Some pedons have an BAk horizon.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is N 4/0 or N 5/0.  In some pedons, it has faint to prominent redoximorphic features with colors of higher chroma than those of the matrix color. These features always are in pedons with a matrix of 2 chroma or 10YR hue.  The texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loamy very fine sand, very fine sand or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Chromas of 3 are allowed below 30 inches.  Redox features range from faint to distinct.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Lower values are more common in the upper part.  Redox features range from faint to prominent.  Texture is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  The horizon commonly has thin layers of silt loam, very fine sandy loam, very fine sand or loamy very fine sand.  Some pedons have 2Cg horizons with properties similar to the 2Bg horizon."
