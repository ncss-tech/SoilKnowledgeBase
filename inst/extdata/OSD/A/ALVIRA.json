  "STATES": "PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Alvira series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy pre-Wisconsin glacial till derived from sandstone, siltstone, shale, and some quartzite. The soils are on glaciated uplands. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Mean annual precipitation is 1066 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is 11.5 degrees C.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 150 to greater than 200 centimeters. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 48 to 75 centimeters and depth to bedrock is greater than 150 centimeters. Rock fragments of sandstone, shale, or quartzite range from 5 to 30 percent above the fragipan and from 5 to 50 percent in the fragipan. Illite and vermiculite are the dominant clay minerals, with appreciable amounts of kaolinite and detectable amounts of montmorillinite and interstratified minerals. Reaction of the solum ranges from strongly acid through extremely acid where unlimed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry color value is 6 or more. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6, and include 2.5Y hue with value of 6 and chroma of 2. Coatings on faces of peds have dominant chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. It has light brownish gray, brown, and strong brown mottles. Prism faces range from gray (5Y 6/1), N (7/0) to pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2). Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam to silty clay loam or clay loam.\nSome pedons have a BC or C horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bx."

The soils developed in loamy pre-Wisconsin glacial till derived from sandstone, siltstone, shale, and some quartzite similar to the underlying rock. The climate is humid temperate; mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C.; the frost free season ranges from about 120 to 170 days; mean annual rainfall ranges from 965 to 1170 millimeters."

Allenwood, Bedington and Berks soils are free of mottles and do not have a fragipan, and the Berks soils also have shale bedrock within 100 centimeters. Hanover and Watson soils do not have low chroma mottles in the upper 25 centimeters inches of the argillic horizon. Comly soils have more than 35 percent base saturation. Albrights and Meckesville soils are on nearby landscapes but have reddish hues."
