  "OVERVIEW": "The Aerobee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian modified gypsiferous fine-loamy alluvium. These nearly level soils are on interdunes, basin floors, and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
