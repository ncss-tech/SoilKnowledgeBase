  "OVERVIEW": "The Aftaden series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian sediments and material weathered from basalt.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Aftaden soils are on uplands with slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
