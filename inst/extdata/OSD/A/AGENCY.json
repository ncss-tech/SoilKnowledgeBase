The soil moisture control section is usually dry and is dry in all parts for 120 to 150 days (cumulative) in the 4 months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  It contains 10 to 30 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate and the acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is less than 0.4 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam or cobbly loam or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  It contains 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles. Total rock fragment content is 5 to 30 percent. It is mildly or moderately alkaline .\nThe 2Crkq horizon is paralithic tuff of the Deschutes Formation.  This horizon is absent in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Capona, Lovline, Quencheroo (T), and Sutro series. Capona soils are slightly acid or neutral and lack the volcanic glass in the surface.  Lovline soils are channery throughout and are moderately deep over schist.  Quencheroo soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock. Sutro soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and lack the lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Agency soils are on terraces and plateaus.  Slopes are o to 70 percent but are typically less than 15 percent.  These soils formed in medium textured eolian materials and are underlain by tuff, basalt, or other components of the Deschutes Formation.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The frost free period is 110 to 140 days."

Era soils are in swales and uplands and are deep and coarse-loamy.  Madras are on terraces and plateaus and have a fine-loamy argillic horizon."

( Ap1, Ap2, and AB horizons )\ncambic horizon - the zone from 16 to 24 inches. ( Bw1 and Bw2 horizons )\nDeschutes Formation - semiconsolidated water-laid sediments composed of sands, gravels, and silts of volcanic origin, and reworked volcanic materials.  Interbedded basalts and ash-flow tuffs are included in this formation.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data are available for this soil.
