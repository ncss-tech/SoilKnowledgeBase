  "OVERVIEW": "The Armijo series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly soils that formed in alluvium in areas of oxbow lakes and sloughs.  Armijo soils are on broad, usually channeled, flood plains or concave terraces around playas and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

Slopes are commonly 0 to 1 percent ranging to 3 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium in areas of oxbow lakes and sloughs.  At the type location the climate is semiarid continental. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches with more than one-half of the total falling in June through September.  The average annual air temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 14."
