  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Armijo soils are on broad, usually channeled, floodplains or concave terraces around playas.  Elevations range from 3,700 to 5,400 feet.  Slopes are commonly 0 to 1 percent ranging to 3 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium in areas of oxbow lakes and sloughs.  At the type location the climate is semiarid continental. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches with more than one-half of the total falling in June through September.  The average annual air temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 14."
