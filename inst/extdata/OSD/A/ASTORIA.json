  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. The soil is usually moist; it is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches. Solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches in thickness. The depth to bedrock is commonly greater than 60 inches but may be as shallow as 40 inches. The amount of partially weathered sandstone or siltstone paragravel in the solum ranges from none to few in the upper part and increases to as much as 50 percent or more below 4 feet in some pedons. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Andic soil properties, when present, do not extend beyond 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry. This horizon usually contains fine concretions. Apparent field texture is silt loam or medial silt loam with a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.0 g/cc and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1 to 3 percent. It has 0 to 10 percent paragravel. The lower part of the A horizon may range from medial silt loam to silty clay loam.\nA BA horizon is present in some pedons and has color similar to the Bw.\nThe Bw horizons usually have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry. The Bw horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent paragravel.\nThe BC horizon, when present, is similar in color to the Bw horizon. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam and has 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 65 percent pararock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Astoria soils are on mountains at elevations of 100 to 2,000 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 90 percent. The soils formed in colluvium or residuum from shale, siltstone, tuffaceous siltstone, sandstone, and micaceous sandstone ranging in age from Eocene to Miocene. Summers are warm and moist, and winters are warm and wet. The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches. Mean July temperature is 61 degrees F. and mean January temperature is 38 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 100 to 210 days."

Trask soils are stony and have more than 50 percent rock fragments in the control section. Preacher and Bohannon soils average less than 35 percent clay in the texture control section. The Bohannon soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic bedrock. All of these soils are on ridgetops, benches, and side slopes of mountains."

The Astoria series is mapped in Oregon and Washington Coast Range Mountains (MLRA 1) and the Quartzville series is mapped in the Oregon Cascade Range Mountains (MLRA 3). Aluminum extractable in 1N KC1 may be higher in the Coast Range (greater than 2 cmol/kg than in the Cascade Range.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data on one pedon (S62 Oreg 36-2) reported in the Soil Survey of Yamhill Area, Oregon, January, 1974. Laboratory data by SCS Soil Survey Laboratory at Riverside, California.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
