    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mineral solum thickness and depth to densic layer is typically 54 to 100 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm. Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and from 5 to 50 percent in the substratum. Redoximorphic features consisting of Fe depletions or concentrations occur in the Spodic horizon within 46 cm of the mineral solum surface. At least 10 cm of the Bhs horizons contain 6 percent or more organic carbon by weight.\nThe O horizon ranges from slightly to highly decomposed plant material. It is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 6. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid in calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution. In some pedons the reaction ranges to ultra acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or less. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or very friable, but up to 25 percent firm areas (ortstein) may be present. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons may have thin sub-horizons of loamy fine sand or loamy sand. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Cd or Cdg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sandy loam. It is massive with or without plate-like divisions, and consistence is firm or very firm.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Adirondack and Foxpaw series are in the same family. Adirondack soils have less than 6 percent organic carbon in the spodic horizon. Foxpaw soils have a friable till substratum.\nClosely related series include the Kawbawgam and Wilmington. Kawbagam soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Wilmington soils are poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ampersand soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils in slightly concave areas and shallow drainage ways on footslopes, toeslopes, and backslopes of glaciated mountainous areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent, but are dominantly 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in loamy till with a dense substratum. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,015 to 1,525 mm, and mean annual temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 500 to 1,000 m above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Ampersand soils are commonly associated with the well drained Mundalite, Rawsonville, and Hogback soils, the well to excessively drained Knob Lock, and the poorly drained Wilmington soils. Mundalite soils are on higher topographic positions. Rawsonville, Hogback, and Knob Lock soils occupy adjacent bedrock controlled positions. Wilmington soils occupy lower topographic positions on the landscape."

Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high through very high in the layers above the substratum and moderately low or moderately high in the substratum. A perched water table is present at a depth of 15 to 46 cm from the mineral soil surface during the months of October through May."
