  "OVERVIEW": "The Ampersand series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy till. They are moderately deep to dense till and very deep to bedrock. They are in shallow depressions and drainageways on backslopes and footslopes in mountainous areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,175 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
