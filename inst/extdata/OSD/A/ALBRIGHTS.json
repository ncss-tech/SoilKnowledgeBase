  "OVERVIEW": "The Albrights Series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils formed dominantly in colluvium or glacial till derived from reddish shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone. They are on upland toeslopes, footslopes and drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Mean annual precipitation is 1090 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is 9 degrees C.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 101 to 160 centimeters or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 150 centimeters. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 46 to 81 centimketers. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum above the Btx, from 10 to 50 percent in the Btx, and from 25 to 75 percent in the C horizon. Reaction, where unlimed, ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part and C horizon. Low chroma redox depletions and high chroma iron-manganese accumulations occur within 40 centimeters of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, values of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or silt loam.\nAn E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nHorizons in the B above the Btx have hue of 2.5 YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 6. Texture ranges from silt loam to clay loam. Structure is usually subangular blocky or blocky. The Btx has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam. Redoximorphic features can have a variety of colors.\nThe C horizon is similar to the B horizon in color and texture but it has massive structure."

Amwell, Canfield, Nockamixon, Rittman, Teegarden, Titusville, and Urbana series are in a similar family but have an active CEC class.  Amwell soils formed in colluvium or glacial material from igneous rocks and contain fragments of basalt.
