  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 65 inches or more. Depth to bedrock ranges from 5 to 8 feet or more. Depth to the fragipan ranges from about 18 to 32 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum above the Btx, from 10 to 50 percent in the Btx, and from 25 to 75 percent in the C horizon. Reaction, where unlimed, ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part and C horizon. Low chroma redox depletions and high chroma iron-manganese accumulations occur within 16 inches of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, values of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or silt loam.\nAn E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nHorizons in the B above the Btx have hue of 2.5 YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 6. Texture ranges from silt loam to clay loam. Structure is usually subangular blocky or blocky. The Bx has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam. Redoximorphic features can have a variety of colors.\nThe C horizon is similar to the B horizon in color and texture but it has massive structure."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Albrights series is the only soil currently in this family.  Nockamixon, Rittman, and Teegarden series are in a similar family but lack hue of 5YR and redder.\nThe Amwell, Canfield, Titusville, Turbotville, and Urbana series may become competitors as their classification is updated to the eighth edition of soil taxonomy.. Amwell soils formed in colluvium or glacial material from igneous rocks and contain fragments of basalt. The Canfield, Titusville, Turbotville, and Urbana soils lack hue of 5YR and redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Albrights soils are on nearly level to moderately steep concave hillsides on footslopes, toeslopes, and in U-shaped drainage heads. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Albrights soils formed in a regolith of colluvium or glacial till from reddish shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone. The climate is temperate and humid, with mean annual precipitation of 36 to 46 inches; average annual temperature is 48 degrees to 55 degrees F., and the frost free growing season is 140 to 220 days."
