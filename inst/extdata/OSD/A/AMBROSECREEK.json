  "OVERVIEW": "The Ambrosecreek series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. These soils are on stream terraces and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
