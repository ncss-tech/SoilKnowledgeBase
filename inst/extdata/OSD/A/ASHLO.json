  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashlo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly and cobbly alluvium or colluvium. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, and eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
