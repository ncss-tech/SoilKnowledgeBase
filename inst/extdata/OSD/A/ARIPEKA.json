  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is 20 to 25 inches but ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  In solution holes, the thickness ranges to 45 inches or more.  Depth to the R horizon ranges from about 23 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly alkaline in the A, E, and Bw horizons and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less.  Content of limestone pebbles and cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Content of limestone pebbles and cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 5, and chroma 3 to 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, yellow, or red range from none common.  Content of limestone pebbles and cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has colors similar to that of the Bw horizon.  Hard limestone cobbles 3 to 10 inches in size comprise 15 to 35 percent of the Bt horizon in pedons with cobbly textures.  Non-cobbly phases usually have less than 5 percent cobbles.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or their cobbly modifiers.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of soft limestone having hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Hard limestone fragments occur randomly throughout the horizon and range from about 20 to 35 percent, by volume.  Solution holes range from none to three in each pedon.\nThe R horizon is composed of hard limestone that can only be excavated by power equipment.  In many pedons, the solution holes are filled with soil and limestone fragments from the overlying horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Tarrytown is the only other series in the same family.  Tarrytown soils are on lower positions, are very deep, have loamy textures in the surface layer and in the upper part of the subsoil, and have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aripeka soils are on low ridges.  Some areas are adjacent to tidal marshes and are on low-lying \"islands\" within tidal marsh areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments overlying limestone.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

The poorly drained Bluff soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and have a mollic epipedon.  The poorly and very poorly drained Boca and Felda soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  In addition, Felda soils are very deep.  The very poorly drained Homosassa soils are in lower tidal marshes.  The poorly drained Lacoochee soils are in lower tidal marshes, have poorly developed spodic horizons, and are shallow do limestone.  The poorly drained Wabasso soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and have spodic horizons.  The very poorly drained Weekiwachee soils are in lower tidal marshes and are organic."
