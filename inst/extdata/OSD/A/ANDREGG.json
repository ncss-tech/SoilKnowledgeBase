  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 65 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The soil between depths of 8 to 24 inches is usually dry all of the time from June until October, and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Fine angular pebbles comprise 0 to 20 percent of the soil volume.  The soils are coarse sandy loam or rarely sandy loam or loam and have more than 40 percent medium sand or coarser in the sand fraction.  Clay content is 7 to 18 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 5/2, 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 2/2, or 3/2.  Dry consistency is soft or slightly hard.  It is slightly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6, or 5YR 4/4.  Moist colors are 1 or 2 units of value darker.  It is slightly through strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a sandy loam C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in material weathered from coarse grained acid igneous rocks, mainly granodiorite.  The climate is moist subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 35 inches.  Average January temperature is 44 degrees F; average July temperature is 76 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 300 days."
