  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy A and C horizons is greater than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through mildly alkaline. Shell fragments are usually absent, but content ranges to 15 percent. Silt plus clay in the control section is less than 5 percent.\nThe O horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Low chroma mottles are the result of uncoated sand grains and not due to wetness.  It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand."

The absence of subsurface pedogenic horizons, mixed mineralogy, and flooding by storm tides are the main diagnostic features of these soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University soil survey lab data shows less than 5 percent silt plus clay and less than 95 percent quartz and other heavy minerals for the typical pedon and 5 other profiles.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nVA0222 ASSATEAGUE  0- 50   57- 65  200-240  25- 60     1-  50\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nVA0222 NONE   RARE   6.0-6.0              -     60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nVA0222  0- 2  COS S FS                0-  0  75-100  0-10    -\nVA0222  2-85  COS S FS                0-  0  75-100  0- 5    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
