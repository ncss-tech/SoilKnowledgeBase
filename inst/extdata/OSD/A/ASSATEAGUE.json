  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Assateague series are very deep and excessively drained.  They formed in sandy sediments.  They are on dunes.  Permeability is very rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 57 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy A and C horizons is greater than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through mildly alkaline. Shell fragments are usually absent, but content ranges to 15 percent. Silt plus clay in the control section is less than 5 percent.\nThe O horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Low chroma mottles are the result of uncoated sand grains and not due to wetness.  It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In the past, Assateague soils have been included in the Fripp and Newhan soils and in the miscellaneous land class Dune land.  The absence of subsurface pedogenic horizons, mixed mineralogy, and flooding by storm tides are the main diagnostic features of these soils.  The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface."
