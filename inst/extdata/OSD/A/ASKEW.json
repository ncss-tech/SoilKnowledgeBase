    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Askew soils are on level to gently sloping low terraces of late Pleistocene age along former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The soil formed in loamy alluvium. The average annual air temperature ranges from about 58 to 64 degrees F and the average annual precipitation ranges from about 46 to 52 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Amagon, Bonn, Bosket, Dubbs, Dundee, Foley, McCrory, Patterson, Tuckerman and Wiville. Amagon soils occur on similar landscapes as Askew soils; have gray matrix color throughout and are poorly drained. Bonn and Foley soils occur on similar landscapes; have natric horizons and are poorly drained. Bosket soils occur on similar landscapes; are in a fine-loamy family and are well drained. Dubbs soils occur on similar landscapes and are well drained. Dundee soils occur on similar landscapes and are somewhat poorly drained. McCrory soils occur on lower landscapes; are in fine-loamy family and have natric horizons. Patterson soils occur along drains on the perimeter of terraces and in depressions in dune fields; are in a fine-loamy family and are somewhat poorly drained. Tuckerman soils occur on lower terraces and flood plains; are in a fine-loamy family and are poorly drained. Wiville soils occur in dune fields; are in a fine-loamy family and are well drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; rate of runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, low on slopes up to 5 percent, and medium on slopes of 5 percent or more; moderate permeability. In undrained conditions, a perched seasonal water table is at 2 to 3 feet below the soil surface from December through April during normal years. Most areas of Askew soils are used for row crops and are artificially drained by constructed ditches in the adjacent lower lying positions, or by land leveling. In these drained areas, the water table does not perch for significant periods in the upper part of the solum, and it is apparent at 4.5 to 6 feet below the surface. Some areas of minor extent are flooded for brief periods from December through May during normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 2004 to add discussion pertaining to drained hydrology in order to make the hydrology statements fit better in relation to the drained areas of Dundee soils. A drained phase of the Askew series will be recognized. In addition, the lithologic discontinuity was changed to \"where present\" since many pedons are not formed in two parent materials. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - surface to a depth of 15 inches\nArgillic horizon - zone from 15 to 39 inches\nLithologic Discontinuity - 39 inches\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
