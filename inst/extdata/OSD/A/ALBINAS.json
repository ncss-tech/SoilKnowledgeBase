  "OVERVIEW": "The Albinas series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources on alluvial fans, and terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 48 centimeters (12 to 19 inches). The average annual air temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. (45 to 50 degrees F.)",
