  "OVERVIEW": "The Arness series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from ignimbrite, tuff, and volcanic ash. Arness soils are on structural benches and hills. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
