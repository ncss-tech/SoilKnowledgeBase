Depth to carbonates, if present, is more than 60 inches. The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and contains less than 7 percent sand. The mean annual soil temperature is 56 to slightly less than 59 degrees F.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap and A) has hue of 10YR, value of 3 (5 dry), andchroma of 1 to 3. In undisturbed areas the A horizon has value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2. Clay content is 15 to 27 percent and sand content is less than 7 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral, depending on the liming history.\nSome pedons have an AB or a BA horizon.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bt) has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6 (2 to 6 in the lower part). Redoximorphic iron depletions are in the lower part, above 40 inches. It typically is silty clay loam, but the lower part is silt loam in some pedons. Clay content is 27 to 35 percent in the upper part and is 24 to 32 percent in the lower part. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe lower part of the series control section (2Bt, 2BC, and 2C, where present) has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam, but is silty clay loam in the upper part in some pedons. Clay content is 18 to 30 percent in the upper part and is 15 to 27 percent in the lower part. Sand content is less than 15 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Catlin soils contain more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section and have carbonates at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Graymont soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 56 degrees F. and have carbonates at depths of less than 40 inches.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Aviston soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping convex summits, shoulders, and backslopes on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent. These soils formed in loess or in loess and the underlying silty pedisediment. The pedisediment is below a depth of 60 inches, where present. The sequence of materials is: Peoria Silt, Roxana Silt, silty pedisediment, and Illinoian drift (typically with a strongly developed paleosol). Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 400 to 800 feet above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Herrick soils and the poorly drained Virden soils are on nearly level interfluves nearby and they form a hydrosequence with the Aviston soils. The moderately well drained Homen soils are in similar landscape positions closer to the drainageways and they form a biosequence with the Aviston soils. The well drained Negley soils developed in strongly weathered Illinois outwash and are on steep slopes below the Aviston soils. The somewhat poorly drained, fine-textured Oconee soils are on less sloping summits closer to the drainageways. The well drained Ruma soils are on convex slopes closer to the drainageways."

Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 16 to 67 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons). Redoximorphic iron depletions - the zone from 23 to 84 inches (Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, and 2BC horizons).
