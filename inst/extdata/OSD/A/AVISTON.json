The moderately well drained Homen soils are in similar landscape positions closer to the drainageways and they form a biosequence with the Aviston soils. The well drained Negley soils developed in strongly weathered Illinois outwash and are on steep slopes below the Aviston soils. The somewhat poorly drained, fine-textured Oconee soils are on less sloping summits closer to the drainageways. The well drained Ruma soils are on convex slopes closer to the drainageways."
