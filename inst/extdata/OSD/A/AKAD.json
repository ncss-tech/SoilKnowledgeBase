  "OVERVIEW": "The Akad series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on foothills and mountains. These soils formed in material weathered from mixed conglomerate rock or sandstone. Slope ranges from 30 to 75percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 279 millimeters (11 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",

Pluth soils have not been described according to soil taxonomy but appear to be moist for a longer period than Akad soils.  Ashokawna soils are dry in the 10 to 31 centimeter (4 to 12 inch) moisture control section from June 1 to October 1 and are strongly acid to slightly acid in the texture control section. Conosta soils have a fine texture control section. Quinto soils have a lithic contact within 51 centimeters (20 inches) of the surface."

Texture determined by hydrometer method. Organic carbon estimated to be 0.7 percent in upper 10 cm based on dark colors and by organic carbon in nearby soils using Walkley-Black digestion method.\nLast revised by the state on 4/85."
