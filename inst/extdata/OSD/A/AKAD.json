Agua Dulce soils have a paralithic contact at 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) and a medium acid or slightly acid reaction in the texture control section. Pluth soils have not been described according to soil taxonomy but appear to be moist for a longer period than Akad soils.  Squawrock soils are dry in the 10 to 31 centimeter (4 to 12 inch) moisture control section from June 1 to October 1 and are strongly acid to slightly acid in the texture control section. Conosta soils have a fine texture control section. Quinto soils have a lithic contact within 51 centimeters (20 inches) of the surface."

Texture determined by hydrometer method. Organic carbon estimated to be 0.7 percent in upper 10 cm based on dark colors and by organic carbon in nearby soils using Walkley-Black digestion method.\nLast revised by the state on 4/85.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
