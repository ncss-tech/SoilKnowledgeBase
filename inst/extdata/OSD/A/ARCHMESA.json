  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Archmesa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from andesite. Archmesa soils are on mesas. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 475 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
