  "OVERVIEW": "The Ard series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in rhyolite residuum with loess influence.  Ard soils are on mountain slopes and loess hills and have slopes of 4 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
