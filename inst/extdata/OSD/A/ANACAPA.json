  "OVERVIEW": "The Anacapa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from predominantly sedimentary rock sources.  Anacapa soils are in flood plains and on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The lime is mostly disseminated but there area also filaments and other small soft lime segregations.  Between depths of 10 and 40 inches clay averages less than 18 percent.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils are moist in some part between depths of 8 and 24 inches slightly more than half the year and are continuously dry from mid-May to early November.  Mean soil temperature is about 62 to 65 F.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown or dark grayish brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or light loam.  This horizon contains about 2 or 3 percent organic matter in the upper part and more than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches, with a regular decrease with depth.  It is usually slightly hard when dry and is not both massive and hard.  The A horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (usually pH 7.0 to 7.8) and is 21 to 41 inches thick.\nThe C horizon is light brownish gray, grayish brown, brown or pale brown in 10YR to 2.5Y hue.  It is sandy loam or loam and may be strongly stratified below a depth of 40 inches."

Nord soils are calcareous within a depth of 5 to 10 inches and have an irregular decrease in organic matter.  Mocho, Sorrento, and Vina soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Salinas soils have more than 18 percent clay and chroma less than 2.  Sheridan soils have slightly to moderately acid C horizons.  Soquel soils lack lime and have a soil temperature below 59 F."

Average January temperature is about 53 F, average July temperature is about 65 F, and mean annual temperature is about 60 F.  The frost-free season is over 300 days."
