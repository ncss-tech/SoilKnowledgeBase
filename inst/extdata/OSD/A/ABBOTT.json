Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches, the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Drained phases are recognized."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 8 to 40 inches (Bg, BCg1, and BCg2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 20 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the A and Bg horizons).\nVertic subgroup feature - The zone from the soil surface to 40 inches with linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more; additional support for the concept is based on the cracks noted in the series concept.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (BCg1 and BCg2 horizons and part of the Bg horizon).\nThe revision of December 2006 updated the taxonomic class from Vertic Fluvaquents based on the recognition of a cambic horizon in the horizons having alteration due to aquic conditions and no evidence of fine stratification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
