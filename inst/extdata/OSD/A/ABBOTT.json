  "OVERVIEW": "The Abbott series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Abbott soils are on flood plains, lake plains, and deltas.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
