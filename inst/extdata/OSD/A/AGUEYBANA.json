They were formerly included in the Los Guineos series.  A soils moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Soil Survey Area update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic soil moisture regime) and at 900 meters above seal level (in Udic Soil Moisture).\nThese soils were formerly included in the Los Guineos series.\nAgueybana soils are in MLRA 270.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Yauco Municipality, Puerto Rico; S01PR-153-001.
