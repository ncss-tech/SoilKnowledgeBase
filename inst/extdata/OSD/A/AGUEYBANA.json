  "OVERVIEW": "The Agueybana series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits and side slopes of mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in residuum that weathered from basalt bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 83 inches.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.",

They were formerly included in the Los Guineos series.  A soils moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Soil Survey Area update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic soil moisture regime) and at 900 meters above seal level (in Udic Soil Moisture).\nThese soils were formerly included in the Los Guineos series.\nAgueybana soils are in MLRA 270.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Yauco Municipality, Puerto Rico; S01PR-153-001.
