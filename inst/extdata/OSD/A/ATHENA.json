    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon\n*Mollic epipedon--zone from 0 to 66 cm\n*Cambic horizon--zone from 66 to 117 cm; Bw1 horizon does not meet organic carbon criteria for mollic epipedon based on associated laboratory data for pedon\n*Identifiable secondary carbonates--zone from 117 to 165 cm\n*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm\n5/20/2015--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of a soil data join recorrelation project. The mean annual air temperature was lowered to 7 degrees C, and the mean annual soil temperature was lowered to 8 degrees.\nFurther MLRA 9-wide investigation is needed to:\n*Determine the extent and influence of the volcanic ash.\n*Consider moving current type location to another location that meets the criteria for the fine-silty taxonomic family particle size. The current location has Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) data associated with it that meets the criteria for the coarse-silty family particle size.\n*Evaluate ecological site descriptions (ESD) correlated to Athena soil components throughout the MLRA. Initial and historical ESDs correlated to Athena soils have a narrower climatic (precipitation) range than those currently correlated to Athena soils. The current ESDs have a broad precipitation range, such as 405 to 610 mm.\n*Correlate Athena soil components that are deep (100 to 150 cm) to a lithic contact.\n*Evaluate eroded phases of Athena soils.\n9/15/2015--The Athena series is mapped dominantly as very deep. It is mapped as deep only in Columbia and Garfield Counties of Washington State. These deep Athena soils should be investigated for potential correlation to other existing series.\n6/2016--This OSD was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nComplete Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) characterization--40A0952\nAdditional complete and partial KSSL data--86P0063, 86P0064, 86P0078, 40A1026, 40A1020\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
