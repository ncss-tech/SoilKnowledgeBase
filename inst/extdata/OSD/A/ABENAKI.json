  "OVERVIEW": "The Abenaki series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy sediments underlain by sandy and gravelly deposits.  They are on alluvial terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid or very rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum; and from 0 to 65 percent in individual horizons in the contrasting material with a weighted average of 35 percent of more within 40 inches from the surface.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, and from strongly acid to neutral in the contrasting material.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture ranges from fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

The moderately well drained Metallak and poorly drained Cohas soils are in a drainage sequence with the Abenaki soils, and are in lower positions on alluvial terraces.  Colton soils have spodic horizons, textures in the B horizon ranging from loamy sand to coarse sand, and are on adjacent glacial outwash terraces.  Ondawa soils are in similar landscape positions, but have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections, and have organic carbon content decreasing irregularly with depth."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 23 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Strongly contrasting particle-size class - the zone from 10 to 23 inches is coarse-loamy, and the zone from 23 to 40 inches is sandy-skeletal.\n2.  The Abenaki series was formerly mapped as Ondawa Variant in New Hampshire.  1300 acres of this soil are correlated as Ondawa Variant in Carroll County, New Hampshire."
