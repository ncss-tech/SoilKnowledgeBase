  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 35 inches, and corresponds to the depth to the contrasting material.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum; and from 0 to 65 percent in individual horizons in the contrasting material with a weighted average of 35 percent of more within 40 inches from the surface.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, and from strongly acid to neutral in the contrasting material.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture ranges from fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cohas, Colton, Metallak and Ondawa series.  The moderately well drained Metallak and poorly drained Cohas soils are in a drainage sequence with the Abenaki soils, and are in lower positions on alluvial terraces.  Colton soils have spodic horizons, textures in the B horizon ranging from loamy sand to coarse sand, and are on adjacent glacial outwash terraces.  Ondawa soils are in similar landscape positions, but have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections, and have organic carbon content decreasing irregularly with depth."

    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 23 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Strongly contrasting particle-size class - the zone from 10 to 23 inches is coarse-loamy, and the zone from 23 to 40 inches is sandy-skeletal.\n2.  The Abenaki series was formerly mapped as Ondawa Variant in New Hampshire.  1300 acres of this soil are correlated as Ondawa Variant in Carroll County, New Hampshire.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
