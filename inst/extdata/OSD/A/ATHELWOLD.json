  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 16 to 34 inches.  Depth to sand and gravel typically is about 36 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 28 inches thick and extends into the Bw horizon in many pedons.  The control section contains 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand that is fine sand or coarser in the upper part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less in the upper part and 1 or 2 in the lower part.  Typically, it is silty clay loam, but some pedons are silt loam.  It ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Typically, it is silty clay loam, but some pedons are silt loam.  Most pedons have few faint mottles in the lower part.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam and has few to many faint or distinct mottles.  It has common or many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate and few to common fine carbonate concretions.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have C horizons that have color and texture of the Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon is calcareous, multicolored, stratified sand and gravel in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  It contains 20 to 60 percent gravel by volume.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Surfaces are plane to slightly concave and slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  Athelwold soils formed in silty material overlying outwash sand and gravel.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."
