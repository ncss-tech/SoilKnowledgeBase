    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  All mineral horizons have n value of 1 or more.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is muck or peat. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, mucky silt loam, silty clay loam, or mucky silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral; Undecomposed logs and wood fragments range from few to many.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty loam, or mucky silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium to acid to mildly alkaline.  Subhorizons of the C horizon contain 50 to 95 percent logs and wood fragments by volume."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  The Allemands, Barbary, Fausse, Gentilly, Larose, and Scatlake series are in closely related families.  Allemands soils have organic surface layers thicker than 16 inches and clayey mineral subhorizons.  Barbary, Fausse, Larose, Gentilly, and Scatlake soils have a very fine control section.  Additionally Fausse soils have n-values of   0.7 between depths of 8 and 20 inches, and Gentilly soils have n-values of  0.7 below depths of 20 inches.  Scatlake soils have moderate to high salinity."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arat soils are on low, broad, ponded\nbackswamp areas along the flood plains of major streams.  They are at elevations less than 3 feet and are nearly continuously flooded.  The soils formed in semifluid loamy sediments.  Slope ranges from 0 to 0.5 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean air temperature is 68 degrees F., and the mean annual rainfall if about 53 inches near the type location."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; ponded;\npermeability is slow. The water level fluctuates between 0 to 3 feet above the soil surface. These soils have never air-dried and consolidated; consequently they remain semifluid. They are nearly continuously flooded with up to 3 feet of water."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for wildlife and recreation.  In most areas the vegetation is dominantly baldcypress and water tupelo.  In other areas, the vegetation consists of freshwater marsh plants such as alligatorweed, water hyacinth, bulltongue, arrowhead, pickerelweed, and maidencane."
