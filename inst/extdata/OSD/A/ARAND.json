The soil moisture control section, 12 and 33 inches, is dry in all parts from May 15 to October 31 and moist in some or all parts from November 1 to May 15. Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth and is assumed to be less than 1 percent from similar soils on similar geomorphic positions. The textural control section is 10 to 40 inches with a clay content weighted average of 5 to 15 percent, gravel content weighted average is 35 to 50 percent. Profile reaction is neutral.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam and very gravelly loam.  Clay content is 7 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon dry color is 10YR  6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2.  Texture is extremely gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sandy loam and very gravelly sand.  Clay content is 3 to 15 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Arand soils are nearly level and are in small valleys and on alluvial fans and floodplains at elevations of 50 to 1,720 feet.  They formed in recent gravelly and cobbly alluvium derived from old terrace deposits and a variety of resistant metamorphic and sedimentary rock sources.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm to hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 21 inches.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees to 50 degrees F., average July temperature is 68 degrees to 78 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 62 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 185 to 250 days."
