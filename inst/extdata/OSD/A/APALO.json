The texture is very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR and 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 3 through 6.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 4 through 8.  The reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper part and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons contain a few films and threads of calcium carbonate in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe B horizon is in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  The reaction is moderately alkaline and calcareous.  Films, threads, soft masses, and concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to common."

Enterprise, Gotebo, and Woodward soils have free carbonates within 28 inches of the surface.  Dill, Hardeman, and Paluxy soils are in similar families.  These soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  In addition, Dill soils are 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone and Hardeman soils have free carbonates within 28 inches of the surface."

The soil formed in calcareous, loamy alluvial material deposited mainly on the inside of bends of major rivers and large streams.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 27 to 34 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 69 degrees F., Frost free period is 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 800 to 1250 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices from 38 to 54."
