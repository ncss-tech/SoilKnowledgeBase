Coarse fragments in the solum, consisting of rounded limestone and siliceous pebbles, range from 1.0 percent to about 5 percent by volume. The 10 to 40 inch control section has a total clay content ranging from 18 to 30 percent with the silicate clay about 10 to 18 percent.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 40 to 50 percent of the Bk and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 3 or 4.  In some pedons gravel occurs below 72 inches."

Altoga, Brackett, Hext, Karnes, and Sanderson soils have soils temperature less than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Altoga soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section; Brackett soils have sola less than 20 inches thick over chalk or Marl; Hext soils as well as Copita and McAllen soils have mixed mineralogy; and Sanderson soils are dry for longer periods in the moisture control section and have loamy-skeletal control section. Copita soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone at depths of less than 40 inches.  Sabenyo soils have 15 to 35 percent cemented calcium carbonate concretions in the control section."

The soil formed in loamy alluvium derived from soils formed from soft limestone, chalk, and marl.  The climate is dry subhumid to semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F.  Frost free days ranges from 235 to 255.  Elevation ranges from 650 to 1500 feet above sea level.

Knippa Castroville, and Uvalde soils have mollic epipedons and more than 18 percent silicate clay in the control section.  They occur at slightly higher elevations.  Sabenyo soils occur along beveled edges of older and higher land surfaces than those in which Atco soils developed. The Orif soils are skeletal and occur in lower positions on floodplains."

Smaller areas are irrigated to these same crops plus some winter vegetables.  The principal native grasses are red grama, threeawn, hooded windmillgrass, bristlegrass, pink pappusgrass, lovegrass, tridens, sideoats grama, Hall's panicum, and grassbur.  Woody plants include mesquite, Texas colubrina, lotebush, guajillo, bluewood condalia, whitebrush, spiny hackberry, and prickelypear cactus."
