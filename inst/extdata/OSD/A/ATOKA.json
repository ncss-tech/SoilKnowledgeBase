  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Atoka series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured calcareous sediments derived mostly from limestone.  Atoka soils are on nearly level to gently sloping piedmont plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
