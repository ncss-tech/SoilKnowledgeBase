  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F.  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 27 inches.  The surface typically is covered by a lag of 5 to 35 percent fine pebbles. Reaction of the profile is neutral or mildly alkaline. These soils are noncalcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 20 percent pebbles.  Clay content ranges from 14 to 20 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture typically is sandy clay loam with more than 35 percent fine sands or coarser.  Coarse fragments range from 10 to 35 percent pebbles.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR; value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 4 through 6.  Textures are loamy sand, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with 35 to 70 percent pebbles."

Beardall soils have silty clay loam or clay loam control sections with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sands.  Bramard, Dunlatop, Hub, Nisula, Stringham, and Telcher soils are deep.  Rimton soils have E and E/B horizons. Swapps soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Ula soils have cobbly or gravelly profiles with lithic fragments.  Ula and Wix soils have a mean summer temperature of less than 47 degrees F.  Wix soils also have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y in the Bt horizon."

Elevation is 7,800 to 9,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is approximately 60 days."
