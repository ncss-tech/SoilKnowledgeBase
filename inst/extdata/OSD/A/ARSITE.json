  "OVERVIEW": "The Arsite series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or in alluvium from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
