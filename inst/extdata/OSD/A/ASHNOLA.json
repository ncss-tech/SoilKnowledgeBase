These soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial till and some colluvium from sedimentary and volcanic rock sources.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
