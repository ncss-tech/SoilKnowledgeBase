  "OVERVIEW": "The Allamore series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soil over very slowly permeable sandstone bedrock.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep sandstone hills and mountains.  Slope ranges from 3 to about 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Allamore soils are on gently sloping to steep sandstone hills and mountains.  The underlying metamorphic sandstone and siltstone bedrock is of the Precambrian Era.  The rock fragments in the A horizons are both sedimentary and igneous materials from nearby hills.  Slopes are from 3 to about 45 percent.  The climate is arid. Elevation is 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  Average annual rainfall is 10 to 16 inches, with most of it occurring in the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210-250 days."

Delnorte soils are shallow over a petrocalcic horizon; Mimbres and Reakor soils have fine-silty control sections.  Mimbres and Reakor soils occur in valleys and draws.  Delnorte soils occur on gravelly ridges in valleys.  Beach and Lozier soils are on similar landscapes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The name is from a small community near the type location. Several thousand acres of this soil have been mapped in Hudspeth County, Texas, now a nonprogressive survey.  The source of carbonates in this soil is believed to be mostly from dust, or ancient slope alluvium.  Although the coarse fragments in the control section are mostly of the sandstone bedrock material, limestone and igneous fragments from nearby hills occur in most pedons.  Faulting is extensive in this vicinity.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 3 to 11 inches (Bk horizon)\nLithic contact - the contact at 11 inches (R horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nRevised for the correlation of Hudspeth County, Texas (Main Part) and Culberson County, Texas (Main Part); July, 2012, NMS\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
