Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 2.5Y 4/3. Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline. The surface inch or so is massive or has coarse platy or blocky structure. The A horizon is free of carbonates in the upper 15 to 36 inches and is intermittently calcareous to moderately calcareous in the lower portion. Slight to distinct accumulation of secondary carbonates is present in the lower part of the A horizon or upper part of the B C horizon.\nThe B horizons have colors of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 7/4; 2.5Y 5/4, 5/3, 6/2, 5/2 or 6/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 3/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2or 5/4. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay. Some areas are gravelly or very gravelly in the lower part. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. It is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent."

Aido soils (MLRA 15), on hills and mountains, have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, do not have strongly expressed intersecting slickensides, and do not have cracks that close for 100 to 150 consecutive days. Alo soils (MLRA 15, 20), on mountains, have a paralithic contact at depths of 24 to 40 inches. Auld soils (MLRA 19, 20), on foothills and uplands, have color hue of 5YR in the A horizon and 5YR through 10YR in the C horizon. Bosanko soils (MLRA 15, 20) typically have a paralithic contact of weathered igneous rock and do not have a Bssk horizon with carbonates. Cibo soils (MLRA 15, 18, 20, 29), on foothills and mountainous uplands, have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Cropley soils (MLRA 14, 19), on fans and flood plains, are very deep and have color hues of 7.5YR or 5YR in the lower part of the profile. Diablo soils (MLRA 15, 17, 20), on uplands, have a Cr horizon at a depth of 40 to 80 inches and have 5Y color hue. Fiale soils (MLRA 20) are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Mckeonhills soils (MLRA 17) have a moderately deep paralithic contact. Myers soils (MLRA 17), in basins, are very deep and do not have a paralithic contact. Porterville soils (MLRA 17, 29), on fans and foothills, are very deep and have color hues of 7.5YR or 5YR in the lower part of the profile.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Altamont soils are on uplands, hills and mountains. Some Altamont soils are on slides on mountain slopes. Slope is 0 to 75 percent. Elevation is 100 to 4,480 feet. These soils formed in material weathered from fine-grained sandstone and shale. The climate is dry subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 25 inches. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 62 degrees F. The mean January temperature is about 45 degrees to 48 degrees F. and the mean July temperature about 65 degrees to 80 degrees F. The frost-free season is 180 to 340 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Restricting this series to fewer MLRA's would be a good place to start a new correlation process. Thorough research of all Soil Survey Areas that have mapped Altamont soil was not done during the 2002 update. This soil was mapped at 3,000 feet elevation in Kings County and the highest elevation of 4,480 feet is located in the Fresno County, Western Part Soil Survey. Further research of this extensive soil may reveal mapping at similar elevations. Competing series updated October 2009.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Eight NSSL characterization pedons: S93CA-011-001, S93CA-011-003, S93CA-011-004 from Colusa County; S58CA-001-003 (Series type location) and S58CA-001-004 from Alameda County; three pedons in Glenn County; S85CA-021-001, S85CA -021-002, and S85CA -021-003; one pedon in Los Angeles County S81CA-037-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
