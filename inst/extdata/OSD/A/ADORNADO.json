The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."

Letrado soils are fine-loamy, do not have mollic epipedons, and occur on toeslopes of interfluves on undulating plateaus. Nyjack soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep, and occur on summits of interfluves on undulating plateaus at lower elevations. Tocal soils are clayey, shallow, and occur on shoulders of interfluves on undulating plateaus."
