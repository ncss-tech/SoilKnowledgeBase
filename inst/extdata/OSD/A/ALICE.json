  "OVERVIEW": "The Alice series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on upland hillslopes and river valley terraces.  They formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium and windblown material.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
