  "OVERVIEW": "The Alpinepeak series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. The Alpinepeak soils are on outwash fans and stream terraces. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part of the profile.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
