They have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are excessively drained.  Fezip soils are on flood plains and have mollic epipedons, sandy particle-size control sections, and are poorly drained.   Lilylake soils are on floodplains and have histic epipedons and are very poorly drained.  Redfish soils are on floodplains and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are poorly drained.  Yankeefork soils are on outwash fans, fan terraces and stream terraces and are well drained."
