  "OVERVIEW": "The Archabal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed acid igneous and minor amounts of basic igneous materials. Archabal soils are on moderately dissected glacial outwash or alluvial terraces, fans, or plains and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
