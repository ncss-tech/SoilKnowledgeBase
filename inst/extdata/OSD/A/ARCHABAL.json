Mean annual soil temperature is 38 degrees to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 52 degrees to 58 degrees F. Some pedons contain large stones in the lower part of the profile.\nThe A horizon ranges in thickness from 10 to 20 inches. Base saturation ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Color value is 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma is 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has about 18 to 25 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in mixed acid igneous and minor amounts of basic igneous material. Elevations are 4,800 to 5,000 feet. The climate is humid continental, cool summer (Trewartha's modified Koppen System), with moist, cold winters and dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 22 to 24 inches. Average January temperature is 20 degrees F.; average July temperature is 64 degrees F. Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees to 45 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."
