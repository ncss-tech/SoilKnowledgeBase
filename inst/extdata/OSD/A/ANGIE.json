  "OVERVIEW": "The Angie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey sediment on Tertiary-aged uplands.  These soils are on broad, level to strongly sloping coastal plains. Slope is dominantly 1 to 5 percent, but the range is 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1473 mm (58 in) and mean annual temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F)",
