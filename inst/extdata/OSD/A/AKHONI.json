They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Tertiary sandstone. Slopes are 1 to 30 percent. Elevation ranges from  7,700 to 9,500 feet. Average annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."

Berland soils have argillic horizons, are very shallow to sandstone, and occur on non-wooded areas. Bikeyah soils are very deep, somewhat poorly drained, and occur on non-wooded toeslopes. Captom soils are deep, have sandy non-mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes. Klizhin soils are deep and very deep, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on footslopes. Retaw soils are very deep, very poorly drained, and occur on adjacent rock basins."
