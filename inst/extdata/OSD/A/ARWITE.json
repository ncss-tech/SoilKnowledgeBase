  "OVERVIEW": "The Arwite series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian deposits derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Arwite soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, terraces, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
