Bigbow soils have buried horizons at depths of less than 40 inches.  Bosonoak soils have a silty clay loam or clay loam Bt horizon, occur above elevations of 6500 feet and receive most of their precipitation between July and October.  Carri, Celavar, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Celacy, Elwop, Gateson and Oldwolf soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Dalhart soils have average annual temperatures of 52 to 59 degrees F.  Deekay and Fort Collins soils have 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arwite soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, terraces, hills and ridges.  They formed in alluvium or eolian deposits derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 4,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or wet snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 105 to 130 days."
