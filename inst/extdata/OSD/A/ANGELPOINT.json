  "OVERVIEW": "The Angelpoint series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in granitic and metamorphic residuum and colluvium. The Angelpoint soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 76 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C.",
