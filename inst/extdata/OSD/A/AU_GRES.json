    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Battlefield, Kinross, Wainola, and Wormet series. Battlefield soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section. Kinross soils are saturated for a period of 90 to 120 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. Wainola soils average more than 50 percent fine sand in the particle-size control section. Wormet soils have a finer textured cap with sandy loam or fine sandy loam textures that is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick."

Slope gradients are predominantly 0 to 3 percent and range from 0 to 6 percent. The Au Gres soils formed in sandy fluvial and lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 680 to 911 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 8.3 degrees C (40 to 47 degrees F). Frost-free period is 90 to 146 days. Elevation is 183 to 549 meters (600 to 1,800 feet) above mean sea level."
