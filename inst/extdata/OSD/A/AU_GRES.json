  "OVERVIEW": "The Au Gres series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy fluvial and lacustrine deposits on ice margin complexes, kame moraines, stream terraces, outwash plains, lake terraces, lake plains, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C. (43 degrees F).",
