  "OVERVIEW": "The Armitage series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium underlain by sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on fans and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
