    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Depth to micaceous schist ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is estimated to be less than 47 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is estimated to be 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 to 24 inches is usually dry in all parts from mid-June to mid-October and moist in all parts from November to April.  The base saturation be Hach kit, is about 40 to 50 percent in the upper 30 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 6/2; 10yr 6/2,6/3, 7/2.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 3/2; 5Y 3/2, 4/2; 10YR 3/2, 4/3.  Where colors are dark, the horizon is too thin to be mollic.  It is loam or silt loam and may be modified by gravel with 18 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It is neutral to medium acid.\nThe B2t horizon is 2.5Y 7/2. 7/4; 5Y 7/2, 7/3, 7/4.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/4, 4/5, 6/6.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with 30 to 35 percent clay and 25 to 50 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  It is slightly or medium acid.\nThe C horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, 8/1; 5Y 7/2, 8/1.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 5/2.  6/4; 5Y 5/3, 6/3.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The mineralogy is assumed to be micaceous; all horizons contain visible flecks of mica and exhibit a greasy feel, characteristic of the mineral; specific data needed.  Moisture and temperature data are also needed.  The argillic horizon in pedon description begins at 14 inches (35cm).  This series was established to identify and map a new family in a survey area that classified soil map unit components only to the family level.\nLast revised by the state on 6/81."
