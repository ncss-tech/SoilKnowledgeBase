Mean summer soil temperature is estimated to be 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 20 to 61 cmis usually dry in all parts from mid-June to mid-October and moist in all parts from November to April.  The base saturation be Hach kit, is about 40 to 50 percent in the upper 76 cm of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 6/2; 10yr 6/2,6/3, 7/2.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 3/2; 5Y 3/2, 4/2; 10YR 3/2, 4/3.  Where colors are dark, the horizon is too thin to be mollic.  It is loam or silt loam and may be modified by gravel with 18 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe B2t horizon is 2.5Y 7/2. 7/4; 5Y 7/2, 7/3, 7/4.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/4, 4/5, 6/6.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with 30 to 35 percent clay and 25 to 50 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  It is slightly or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, 8/1; 5Y 7/2, 8/1.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 5/2.  6/4; 5Y 5/3, 6/3.

Moisture and temperature data are also needed.  The argillic horizon in pedon description begins at 37 cm.  This series was established to identify and map a new family in a survey area that classified soil map unit components only to the family level.\nLast revised by the state on 6/81."
