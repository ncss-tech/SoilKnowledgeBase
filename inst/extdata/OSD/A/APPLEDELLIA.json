  "OVERVIEW": "The Appledellia series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from basalt and some granite.  They are on terraces and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  Permeability is slow. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The climate is mesic with average annual precipitation of 16 to 25 inches, most of which falls as snow in the winter.  The average annual air temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F.
