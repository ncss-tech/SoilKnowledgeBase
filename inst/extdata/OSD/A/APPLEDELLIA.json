The soil formed in mixed alluvium from basalt, granite, and some metamorphic rock.  The climate is mesic with average annual precipitation of 16 to 25 inches, most of which falls as snow in the winter.  The average annual air temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Appleshall soils have a duripan at 20 to 20 inch depths.  All other soils lack a duripan.  Bakeoven soils are very shallow to basalt.  Deshler soils are moderately deep to tuff.  Gem and Meland soils are moderately deep to basalt.  Langrell, Midvale, and Newell soils are deep.  Reywat and Riggins soils are shallow to basalt."
