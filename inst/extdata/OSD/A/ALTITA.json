  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 36 to more than 60 inches.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 dS/m in the A horizon; 1.0 to 4.0 in the upper Bt horizon; and 4.0 to 12.0 in the lower Bt and C horizons.  linear extensibility exceed 6 cm. in the majority of pedons.  COLE of the control section ranges from 0.07 to 0.09.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  In pedons where the moist value is less than 3.5 the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  In some pedons, the upper 2 to 8 inches is noncalcareous.\nThe Btk and Btyz horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay with few to common masses and clusters of salts.\nThe Byz horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay with few to many soft shale fragments and common or many masses and clusters of salts.  Soft shale fragments that slake in water comprise 0 to 30 percent by volume in the upper 6 inches and increase with depth.  The C horizon where present is similar to the Byz but has higher color values."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in the family.  Similar soils are the Aguilares, Denhawken, Garceno, Orla, Pryor, Reeves, and Tonio series.  Aguilares, Orla, Reeves, and Tonio soils are in the fine-loamy family.  In addition, Aguilares and Tonio soils do not have argillic or gypsic horizons, and Orla and Reeves soils have gypsic mineralogy.  Denhawken soils are moist in the control section for longer periods.  Garceno soils do not have argillic or gypsic horizons, and do not have vertic properties.  Pryor soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Altita soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland plains.  These soils occupy the microhighs in complex soil areas.   Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent but are mostly less than 0.5 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous loamy alluvium over residuum.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 275 to 300 days, and elevation ranges from 400 to 600 feet. Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 25 to 34."

Amphion, Chacon and Divot soils are on lower elevations in the landscape.  Caid soils are on landscapes similar to areas of Altita soils.  Charco soils have mollic epipedons.  Cotulla soils are at lower elevations.  Maverick soils are more clayey throughout with C horizons dominated by clay shale.  Maverick soils occur at higher elevations."
