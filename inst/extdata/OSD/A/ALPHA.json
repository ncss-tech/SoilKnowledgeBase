  "OVERVIEW": "The Alpha series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt with surficial mantles of loess.  Alpha soils are on hills.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
