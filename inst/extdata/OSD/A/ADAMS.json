The Duxbury, Pence, and Stutts soils have combined content of silt plus clay greater than 15 percent in the A, E, Bhs, and Bs horizons. Fishcreek (T) soils are formed in sandy glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits derived from predominantly sedimentary source material.\nThe Sheddenbrook series is in a related family. Sheddenbrook soils have bedrock within a depth of 100 centimeters and have redoximorphic features within a depth of 75 centimeters from the surface."

Colton soils have an average rock fragment content of at least 35 percent between depths of 25 and 100 centimeters. Becket, Berkshire, and Hermon soils are on surrounding uplands in till deposits. The moderately well drained Croghan soils and somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Naumburg soils are on low lying areas of sand plains and terraces."

    "content": "REMARKS: 1. Adams soils are no longer maintained in MLRA's 93 and 94B. Series have been proposed which better represent the previously correlated phases of the Adams series in these MLRA'S when these areas are updated.\n2. Adams soils will not be recognized in MLRA 144A because of soil temperature when these areas are updated.\n3. Adams soils are made up of mainly parent material from metamorphic and igneous sources and will be replaced in MLRA 141 by Fishcreek and other series that are derived from parent material of mostly sedimentary rock.\n4. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na.) Albic horizon - from 3 to 10 cm (E horizon).\nb.) Spodic horizon - from 10 to 43 cm (Bh, Bhs, and Bs horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
