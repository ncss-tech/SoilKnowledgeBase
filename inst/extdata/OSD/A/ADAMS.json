Unless limed, reaction is extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand. In some pedons texture is loamy very fine sand or fine sandy loam. Structure is granular or weak subangular blocky in some pedons, but most pedons are single-grain. Consistence is friable through loose. Reaction is extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe Bhs or Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand. Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium granular or weak subangular blocky, or the horizon is single-grained or massive. Consistence is very friable or friable. Massive, cemented bodies, 1 to 20 centimeters across, range from 0 through 30 percent of the exposed surface area of the horizon. Reaction is extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky, or the horizon is single-grain or massive. Consistence is very friable or loose. Massive, cemented bodies range from 0 through 30 percent of the exposed surface area of the Bs horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. The texture is fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have texture of loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Consistence is very friable or loose. Cemented bodies range up to 20 percent of the exposed surface area in some pedons. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cusino, Duxbury, Fishcreek (T), Kalkaska, Liminga, Pence, and Stutts series. All except Duxbury and Fishcreek occur outside region 12. Duxbury soils have a thicker loamy mantle and higher rock fragment content in the substratum. The Cusino, Kalkaska, and Liminga soils have dry soil moisture status within 91 centimeters of the soil surface in the month of August. The Duxbury, Pence, and Stutts soils have combined content of silt plus clay greater than 15 percent in the A, E, Bhs, and Bs horizons. Fishcreek (T) soils are formed in sandy glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits derived from predominantly sedimentary source material.\nThe Sheddenbrook series is in a related family. Sheddenbrook soils have bedrock within a depth of 100 centimeters and have redoximorphic features within a depth of 75 centimeters from the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Adams soils are on nearly level to very steep sand plains, kames, moraines, benches, eskers, deltas, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 through 70 percent. These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits from predominantly crystalline rock or meta-sandstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 8 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1270 millimeters, and mean annual frost-free period ranges from 70 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 80 to 915 meters above sea level."

Allagash, Colton, and Duxbury soils are on similar landscapes. Allagash and Duxbury soils are loamy in the upper part. Colton soils have an average rock fragment content of at least 35 percent between depths of 25 and 100 centimeters. Becket, Berkshire, and Hermon soils are on surrounding uplands in till deposits. The moderately well drained Croghan soils and somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Naumburg soils are on low lying areas of sand plains and terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. Adams soils are no longer maintained in MLRA's 93 and 94B. Series have been proposed which better represent the previously correlated phases of the Adams series in these MLRA'S when these areas are updated.\n2. Adams soils will not be recognized in MLRA 144A because of soil temperature when these areas are updated.\n3. Adams soils are made up of mainly parent material from metamorphic and igneous sources and will be replaced in MLRA 141 by Fishcreek and other series that are derived from parent material of mostly sedimentary rock.\n4. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na.) Albic horizon - from 3 to 10 cm (E horizon).\nb.) Spodic horizon - from 10 to 43 cm (Bh, Bhs, and Bs horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
