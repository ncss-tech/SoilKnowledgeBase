  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Aftad series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy lacustrine deposits. These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces, glacial lake plains, and delta kames.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 765 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
