Elevations range from 610 to 1,676 meters (2,000 to 5,500 feet). The soils formed in organic matter over basic volcanic ash and tropospheric dust over residuum weathered from basalt. The mean annual rainfall is 1905 to 10,160 millimeters (75 to 400 inches) with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. Landscapes are fog or cloud covered during most of the day throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 16 degrees C (57 to 61 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
