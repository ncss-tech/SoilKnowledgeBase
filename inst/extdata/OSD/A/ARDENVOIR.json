  "OVERVIEW": "The Ardenvoir series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains and foothills. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.",

It is currently mapped in the Cashmere Mountain Areas, Washington  (WA608); Chelan County Area, Washington (WA607), Benewah County Area, Idaho (ID620 and ID607 out of date), and Latah County, Idaho (ID057).  In all surveys except the Cashmere Mountain Survey, the series concept defines a paralithic contact as the modal.  The OSD will be revised to reflect a paralithic contact and documentation made in the Cashmere Mt. soil survey database to reflect the need to review the Ardenvoir series concept during the update process for MLRA 3.  09/06\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available for Soil Survey Sample Numbers: S02ID009-001 and S02ID009-002 Benewah County, Idaho.
