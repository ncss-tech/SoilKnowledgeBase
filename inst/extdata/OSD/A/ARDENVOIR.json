  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ardenvoir soils are on mountains and foothills. Slope ranges from 5 to 90 percent. They occupy all aspects at lower elevations, but mainly occupy southerly aspects at higher elevations. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevation ranges from 2,200 to 5,100 feet (670 to 1555 meters). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches (483 to 889 mm). The frost-free period is from 80 to 120 days."

It is currently mapped in the Cashmere Mountain Areas, Washington  (WA608); Chelan County Area, Washington (WA607), Benewah County Area, Idaho (ID620 and ID607 out of date), and Latah County, Idaho (ID057).  In all surveys except the Cashmere Mountain Survey, the series concept defines a paralithic contact as the modal.  The OSD will be revised to reflect a paralithic contact and documentation made in the Cashmere Mt. soil survey database to reflect the need to review the Ardenvoir series concept during the update process for MLRA 3.  09/06\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available for Soil Survey Sample Numbers: S02ID009-001 and S02ID009-002 Benewah County, Idaho.
