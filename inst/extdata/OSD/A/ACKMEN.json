  "OVERVIEW": "The Ackmen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from intrusive igneous and mixed sedimentary rocks.  Ackmen soils are in valleys, draws, and drainageways, and on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Coleridge, Hord, Roxbury, and Vega series. Alcester soils have A1 horizons 14 to 20 inches thick and lack stratification. Gabaldon soils are calcareous throughout and have a cambic horizon. Hord, Coleridge, Muir, Shell, and Tobin soils are all Typic Ustic with mean annual precipitation of 25 to 30 inches. Irak soils have a water table at 1 to 3 feet during part of the year. Roxbury soils have carbonates at depths of less than 15 inches.  Vega soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the series control section.  Trementina soils have carbonates at depths between 15 and 30 inches."
