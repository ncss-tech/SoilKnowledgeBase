Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Coleridge, Hord, Roxbury, and Vega series. Alcester soils have A1 horizons 14 to 20 inches thick and lack stratification. Gabaldon soils are calcareous throughout and have a cambic horizon. Hord, Coleridge, Muir, Shell, and Tobin soils are all Typic Ustic with mean annual precipitation of 25 to 30 inches. Irak soils have a water table at 1 to 3 feet during part of the year. Roxbury soils have carbonates at depths of less than 15 inches.  Vega soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the series control section.  Trementina soils have carbonates at depths between 15 and 30 inches."
