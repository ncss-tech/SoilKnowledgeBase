  "OVERVIEW": "The Auggie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lacustrine terraces in glaciated valleys.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
