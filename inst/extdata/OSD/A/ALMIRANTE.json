  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Almirante series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on coastal plains and valleys.  They formed in clayey sediments of mixed origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",

Bayamon and Pina soils are on similar positions and have red, more weathered control sections and have oxic rather than argillic horizons.  Tanama soils are on higher positions and are shallow to hard limestone bedrock.  Vega Alta soils are on similar positions, have less clay in the control section, and are Ultisols."
