Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.   Texture is clay.\nThe upper part of the Btv horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of yellow or red range from few to common.  Plinthite ranges from 5 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay.\nThe lower part of the Btv horizon has no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of brown, red, yellow, and gray.  Plinthite ranges from 5 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay."

They formed in fine textured sediments of mixed origin.  These are known locally as coastal plains clays or tertiary clays.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 70 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 77 to 79 degrees F."

Bayamon and Pina soils are on similar positions and have red, more weathered control sections and have oxic rather than argillic horizons.  Tanama soils are on higher positions and are shallow to hard limestone bedrock.  Vega Alta soils are on similar positions, have less clay in the control section, and are Ultisols."
