  "OVERVIEW": "The Averett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sandstone and shale.  Averett soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 48 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
