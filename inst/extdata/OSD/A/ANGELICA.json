  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to free carbonates typically averages 38 to 64 centimeters, but ranges from 30 to 76 centimeters. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 1 to 25 percent in the C horizon. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Some pedons have free carbonates in the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. Where present the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A horizon is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or mucky analogues of these textures. The A or Ap horizon ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, to 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features range from faint to prominent where matrix colors have chroma of 2. It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 10YR, to 5YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. The Bw2 horizon has hue of 5.YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. The matrix colors in the Bw1 and Bw2 horizons reflect the color of the parent materials. Reaction of the Bw horizons ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, to 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 4. It is typically loam, but gravelly loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or clay loam with less than 35 percent clay is included. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Cathro and Tacoosh soils are shallow organic soils that are common associates on lower topographic positions. Mackinac, Onaway, and Trenary soils are on higher landform positions and form a drainage sequence with Angelica."

This soil has representative wet soil moisture status that ranges from the surface to 61 centimeters below the surface at times throughout the year. This soil has representative ponding depth at 7 to 15 centimeters at times during the period from October to June. Surface runoff is slow or ponded. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high."
