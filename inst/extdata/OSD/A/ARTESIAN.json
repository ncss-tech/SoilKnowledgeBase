  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 42 inches and commonly extends through the Bw horizon.  Depth to carbonates typically is 6 to 12 inches, but ranges from 0 to 16 inches.  The control section averages between 45 and 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand that is fine sand or coarser.  Cracks 1/2 inch or more wide and at least 12 inches long at a depth of 20 inches extend upward to the surface or base of the Ap horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is clay or silty clay but is clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral; value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is clay but is silty clay in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bkg and Bzg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay. Some pedons do not have Bzg horizons.  Some pedons have faint or distinct mottles.  In some pedons, the Bk horizon has accumulations of gypsum and other salts.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is clay or silty clay but is clay loam or silty clay loam in the lower part in some pedons.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Thin strata of coarser-textured materials are between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Boyd, Ottumwa, and Verdel series. Boyd soils have shale bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Ottumwa soils have a drier climate and formed in sediments from clay shale.  Verdel soils lack free carbonates above 20 inches and formed in alluvium derived from shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Artesian soils are on broad, low-lying flats in glacial outwash plains.  Surfaces are plane or slightly convex and slope gradients are typically 2 percent or less.  The soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 17 to 24 inches."

Blendon soils are coarse-loamy.  Enet and Hand soils are fine-loamy.  Farmsworth soils have a natric horizon and are intermixed with the Artesian soils.  Durrstein soils have natric horizons, are wetter, and are in lower parts of the landscape.  Whitelake and Woonsocket soils are on similar parts of the landscape and are fine-loamy.  In addition, Whitelake soils have a natric horizon."
