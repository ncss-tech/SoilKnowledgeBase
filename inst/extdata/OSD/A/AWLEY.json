  "OVERVIEW": "The Awley series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Slopes range from15 to 65 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
