  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Abela soils are on fan remnants and lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, some intermediate igneous rocks, and quartzite.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 7,200 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 160 days."
