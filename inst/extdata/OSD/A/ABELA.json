  "OVERVIEW": "The Abela series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite.  Abela soils are on fan remnants and lake terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
