  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates and the calcic horizon is 24 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  These soils have a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  The calcic horizon has an estimated 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is commonly neutral or slightly alkaline but ranges to very strongly alkaline when irrigated.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4, 5, or 6 dry, 3, 4, or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a cemented or gravelly substratum at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

Chedehap and Haybourne soils have a sandy 2C horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Clems soils lack calcareous material above a depth of 45 inches.  Crestline soils are calcareous at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Deschutes, Prosser, and Vining soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Irrigon and Wiehl soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Kecko soils have a calcic horizon with 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Rebel, Royal, and Scooteney soils have a solum thickness and depth to lime of less than 24 inches.  Also, Royal soils are stratified in the C horizon and Scooteney soils have 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Sagehill soils have a stratified 2C horizon at a depth of 15 to 30 inches."

They occur in an arid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches.  Mean July temperature is 71 degrees F.  Mean January temperature is 28 degrees F.  Mean annual air temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."
