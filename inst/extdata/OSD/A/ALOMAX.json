Areas of rock outcrop, stones, and cobbles are common and occupy up to 30 percent of the surface.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,230.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm including 90 to 100 cm of annual snowfall.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
