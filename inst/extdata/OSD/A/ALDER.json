  "OVERVIEW": "The Alder series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from consolidated shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
