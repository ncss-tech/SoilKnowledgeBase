  "OVERVIEW": "The Archrock series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively  drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from granitic rocks, gneiss and schist.  Archrock soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
