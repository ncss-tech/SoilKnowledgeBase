    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arojomil soils are on interfluves of undulating plains formed in eolian material derived from sandstone and siltstone over alluvium derived from Precambrian age granite, gneiss, and schist. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
