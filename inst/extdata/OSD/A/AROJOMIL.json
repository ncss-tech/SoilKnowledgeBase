  "OVERVIEW": "The Arojomil series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in eolian material over relict alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Arojomil soils are located on interfluves of undulating plains and alluvial fan remnants from the southern Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
