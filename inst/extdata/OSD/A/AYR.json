  "OVERVIEW": "The Ayr series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in sandy deposits and loam glacial till on till plains. Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper layers and moderately slow in the lower part of the solum and the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is 5l degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

The combined thickness of the sandy layers above the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 30 inches. (If the sandy layer above the Bt is 20 inches or more thick the soil is in an arenic subgroup. The Bt1 horizon is 6 to 10 inches thick. That leaves 16 to 26 inches for the sandy layers above the argillic horizon. The type location is 26 inches deep to the top of the argillic horizon).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Dry value is 5 or less. It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand. Gravel content is 1 percent or less. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Gravel content is 1 percent or less. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It contains less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent. It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains free carbonates."

All of these soils, except the Halverson series, do not have a mollic epipedon. The Halverson soils are frigid and are loamy throughout the argillic horizon.  In addition, Aubbeenaubbee, Metamora, and Owosso soils are fine-loamy; Hillsdale soils are coarse-loamy; and Markton, Metea, and Seward soils are loamy."

Aubbeenaubbee, Markton, Rensselaer, Watseka, and Wolcott soils are on lower lying topographic positions and have a predominantly gray solum.
