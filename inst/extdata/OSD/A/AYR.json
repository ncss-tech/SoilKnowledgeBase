  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 29 (total of 20\" above argillic, 6\" sandy argillic, and 3\" loamy argillic) to 40 inches and commonly is the same as depth to free carbonates. The combined thickness of the sandy layers above the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 30 inches. (If the sandy layer above the Bt is 20 inches or more thick the soil is in an arenic subgroup. The Bt1 horizon is 6 to 10 inches thick. That leaves 16 to 26 inches for the sandy layers above the argillic horizon. The type location is 26 inches deep to the top of the argillic horizon).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Dry value is 5 or less. It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand. Gravel content is 1 percent or less. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Gravel content is 1 percent or less. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It contains less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent. It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains free carbonates."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Series in closely related families are Aubbeenaubbee, Halverson, Hillsdale, Markton, Metamora, Metea, Owosso, and Seward. All of these soils, except the Halverson series, do not have a mollic epipedon. The Halverson soils are frigid and are loamy throughout the argillic horizon.  In addition, Aubbeenaubbee, Metamora, and Owosso soils are fine-loamy; Hillsdale soils are coarse-loamy; and Markton, Metea, and Seward soils are loamy."

Ayr soils formed in 20 to 36 inches of water and windlaid sandy sediments and the underlying loamy glacial till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 30 to 40 inches."

Ade and Sparta soils are dominantly on higher lying topographic positions and are sandy to depths of 60 inches or more. Aubbeenaubbee, Markton, Rensselaer, Watseka, and Wolcott soils are on lower lying topographic positions and have a predominantly gray solum. Metea soils are on similar topographic positions but do not have a mollic epipedon. Montmorenci, Octagon, and Parr soils are on similar topographic positions and do not have the sandy upper sola."
