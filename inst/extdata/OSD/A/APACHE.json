  "OVERVIEW": "The Apache series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to basalt bedrock.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in a thin layer of material weathered from basalt and eolian sediments. Apache soils are on the outer margins of basalt flows and mesas.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches; the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
