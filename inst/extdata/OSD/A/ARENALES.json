  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10 to 40 inch section of the profile is well graded, ranging from silts to coarse sand and gravel.  Coarse fragments are less than 35 percent, by volume in the control section.  Depth to the gravel and sand layer is 40 to 55 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 and 4, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon, or 3C horizon, where present, has colors similar to the C horizon.  Texture is very gravelly or extremely gravelly fine to coarse sand or sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arenales soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  They formed in stratified, coarse-textured sediments derived from volcanic and limestone rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 78 to 80 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Guamani, Jacaguas, San Anton, and Vayas series which occur in the flood plain.  Guamani soils are on similar positions but have a cambic horizon and a control section that is loamy in the upper part and gravelly in the lower part.  Jacaguas soils are on similar topographic positions close to the streams but have mollic epipedons and more than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout.  The well drained San Anton soils are on slightly higher positions and have mollic epipedons.  The poorly drained Vayas soils are on lower positions and are clayey."
