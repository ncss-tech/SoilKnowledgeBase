  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. GRB",
  "REVDATE": "09/2002",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arenales series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on flood plains and alluvial fans.  They formed in stratified coarse sediments derived from volcanic and limestone rocks. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10 to 40 inch section of the profile is well graded, ranging from silts to coarse sand and gravel.  Coarse fragments are less than 35 percent, by volume in the control section.  Depth to the gravel and sand layer is 40 to 55 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 and 4, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon, or 3C horizon, where present, has colors similar to the C horizon.  Texture is very gravelly or extremely gravelly fine to coarse sand or sand."

Guamani soils are on similar positions but have a cambic horizon and a control section that is loamy in the upper part and gravelly in the lower part.  Jacaguas soils are on similar topographic positions close to the streams but have mollic epipedons and more than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout.  The well drained San Anton soils are on slightly higher positions and have mollic epipedons.  The poorly drained Vayas soils are on lower positions and are clayey."
