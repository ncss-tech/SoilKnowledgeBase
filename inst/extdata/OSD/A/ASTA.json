  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 60 inches or more deep to softly consolidated, tuff-like, glacial outwash or till.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from April 1 to November 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from May 1 to November 1.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 24 inches is dry from July 15 to October 15 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The amount of rock fragments on the soil surface is 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 10 to 30 percent rounded gravel, and iron concretions that are 2 to 15 mm in diameter.  The amount of rock fragments throughout the soil profile range from 0 to 25 percent and consists of rounded cobbles and medium, fine and very fine rounded gravel.  The weighted average of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  The rounded gravel are commonly more plentiful in the upper 20 to 40 inches.  About 0 to 15 percent of the fragments are Fe/Mn concretions.  The bulk density ranges from 0.6 to 1 g/cc to a depth of 10 to 20 inches but is 0.85 g/cc or more at a depth of 10 to 14 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark brown, brown, reddish yellow, strong brown, yellowish brown or 1ight yellowish brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6).  Moist color is black, dark reddish brown, reddish brown, dark brown, very dark grayish brown or very dark brown (5YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3).  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam with 10 to 15 percent clay and may have gravelly or cobbly modifiers. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid and the base saturation ranges from 25 to 45 percent.  The NaF pH ranges from 9.0 to 10.0.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons are reddish yellow, yellowish red, yellow, strong brown, brown, dark brown, pale brown, very pale brown (5YR 5/6, 6/6; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 6/2, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6).  Moist color is yellowish red, reddish yellow, reddish brown, strong brown or dark brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/6, 6/6, 6/8).  They are loam or silt loam with 13 to 27 percent clay. The weighted average of the upper 20 to 30 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 25 percent clay and 0.9 to 2 percent organic carbon.  They are very strongly acid or strongly acid and the base saturation ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  In the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon the B.D. ranges from 1 to 1.2 g/cc.\nIt is common to have all or a combination of the following transitional horizons:  A3, B1, B1t, B3 or B3t.\nThe 3C horizon is weakly to strongly cemented and tuff-like and may have very coarse vesicular cavities throughout. Textures are silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.  The layer restricts roots but water is transmitted slowly.  The material is weathering in most pedons.  Some pedons lack the IIIC horizon.  Some pedons have unrelated Cr horizons with paralithic contacts at depths of 60 to 80 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arta, Cohasset, Garrard and Horseshoe series in other families.  The Arta and Garrard soils have clayey control sections and umbric epipedons. Cohasset soils lack volcanic ash materials and have base saturation of 35 to 50 percent in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Horseshoe soils lack volcanic ash, have a B2t horizon with 25 to 35 percent clay and 5YR and 2.5YR hues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Asta soils are on deeply dissected terrace and terrace faces at elevations of 3,000 to 5,000 feet.  The soils formed in glacial outwash from extrusive igneous rock sources with a thick overlay of fine and very fine volcanic ash.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 55 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 60 to 100 inches.  Mean January temperature is 28 to 34 degrees  F.; mean July temperature is 64 to 58 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 80 to 140 days."

Boomer soils have base saturation greater than 35 percent in the argillic horizon and lack volcanic ash materials in the soil.  Deetz and Shasta soils have ashy control sections.  Neer soils are moderately deep and have a medial-skeletal control section. Odas soils are poorly drained and have a coarse-loamy control section. Ponto soils have a cambic horizon and medial control section."
