  "OVERVIEW": "The Ardnas series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, and other basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  Ardnas soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
