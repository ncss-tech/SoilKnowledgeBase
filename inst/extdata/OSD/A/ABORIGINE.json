    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aborigine soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in marine or lacustrine sediments.  Elevations are 76 to 244 meters (250 to 800 feet).  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1015 to 1800 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 260 to 330 days."

Blacklock soils occur on the same landscape position and have an iron cemented hardpan (ortstein) at a depth of 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches). Burriscreek soils are fine-silty with less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and well drained without redoximorphic features within 100 centimeters (40 inches).  Burriscreek soils are found on linear to slightly convex, gently sloping shoulder and summit positions generally below the Savagecreek soils."

The saturated zone starts between the surface and a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches) and extends to greater than 152 centimeters (60 inches).  The subsoil remains moist or wet throughout the year.  Surface runoff under bare soil conditions is very slow or slow; very slow permeability."

Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - Albic horizon - 0 to 13 inches (E, EB)  Clay content (Davis hydrometer) E = 6 percent, EB = 20 percent.\nArgillic horizon - 13 to 61 inches  2Btg, 3Btg, 4Btg1, 4Btg2.  Clay content (Davis hydrometer); 2Btg = 45 percent, 3Btg = 39 percent, 4Btg1 = 37 percent, 4Btg2 = 44 percent.  Base saturation (Davis, Barium chloride pH 8.2). 2Btg = 5 percent, 3Btg = 7 percent, 4Btg1 = 6 percent.  Discontinuities based on very fine sand fraction on a clay free basis.\nAquic moisture regime - Soil is saturated from December through April.  Dominant moist chromas of 2 or less in argillic horizon, with associated high chroma mottles.  Ped surfaces have moist chromas of 1 or less - 2Btg, 3Btg, 4Btg1, 4Btg2\nMineralogy assumed to be mixed but influenced by kaolinite.\nIsomesic temperature regime - based on west Mendocino temp. site 5a that was in an area mapped as Aborigine.  Site 5a had a difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures of 9 degrees F.\nLaboratory Analysis by U.C. Davis soil morphology lab sample No. 84-045-8 (1609).\nMany areas mapped as Aborigine soils were mapped as the Blacklock series in the Wildlands Soils and Associated Vegetation of Mendocino County, by the State Cooperative Soil Vegetation Survey 1947-1950.\nScanned by SSQA 11/93.
