Burriscreek soils are fine-silty with less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and well drained without redoximorphic features within 100 centimeters (40 inches).  Burriscreek soils are found on linear to slightly convex, gently sloping shoulder and summit positions generally below the Savagecreek soils."

Clay content (Davis hydrometer); 2Btg = 45 percent, 3Btg = 39 percent, 4Btg1 = 37 percent, 4Btg2 = 44 percent.  Base saturation (Davis, Barium chloride pH 8.2). 2Btg = 5 percent, 3Btg = 7 percent, 4Btg1 = 6 percent.  Discontinuities based on very fine sand fraction on a clay free basis.\nAquic moisture regime - Soil is saturated from December through April.  Dominant moist chromas of 2 or less in argillic horizon, with associated high chroma mottles.  Ped surfaces have moist chromas of 1 or less - 2Btg, 3Btg, 4Btg1, 4Btg2\nMineralogy assumed to be mixed but influenced by kaolinite.\nIsomesic temperature regime - based on west Mendocino temp. site 5a that was in an area mapped as Aborigine.  Site 5a had a difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures of 9 degrees F.\nLaboratory Analysis by U.C. Davis soil morphology lab sample No. 84-045-8 (1609).\nMany areas mapped as Aborigine soils were mapped as the Blacklock series in the Wildlands Soils and Associated Vegetation of Mendocino County, by the State Cooperative Soil Vegetation Survey 1947-1950.\nScanned by SSQA 11/93.
