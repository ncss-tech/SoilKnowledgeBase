  "OVERVIEW": "The Azaar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over calcareous siltstone and sandstone residuum. These soils occur on fan remnants, escarpments, hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
