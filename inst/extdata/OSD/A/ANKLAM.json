  "OVERVIEW": "The Anklam series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from metamorphic and igneous rock.  Anklam soils are on hills, mountains and pediments and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
