  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 61 to 122 cm. Redoximorphic features consisting of Fe depletions and concentrations occur within 50 cm of mineral soil surface. Depth to carbonates ranges from 61 to 152 cm. Rock fragments, mostly gravel size, range from 0 to 2 percent in the solum and from 0 to 20 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2. It is commonly silty clay loam or silty clay and is less commonly silt loam or clay loam. Mucky analogs of these textures are recognized. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon is neutral in color or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 0 to 2. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is neutral in color or has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 0 to 3. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or silt loam. Thin layers of very fine sand or fine sand are in some pedons. It is often varved and it may be either massive or exhibit plates or have a tendency to part along varves. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in fine marine or lacustrine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C; mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1490 mm; and the mean annual frost-free days ranges from 100 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 25 to 375 meters above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elmwood, Flackville, Heuvelton, Malone, Matoon, Munuscong, Muskellunge, Ogdensburg, Ruse, Stockholm, and Swanton soils. Elmwood and Flackville soils are on higher topographic positions than Adjidaumo soils. Elmwood is coarse-loamy over clayey, and Flackville is a member of the sandy over clayey textural family. Heuvelton, Matoon, and Muskellunge soils are on higher landscape positions and, in addition, Heuvelton soils have an udic moisture regime. Matoon and Muskellunge soils have a layer above 76 cm that have more than 40 percent high chroma colors. Munuscong, Stockholm and Swanton soils are on similar topographic positions as Adjidaumo soils but have strongly contrasting family textures. Munuscong and Swanton soils are coarse-loamy over clayey and Stockholm soils are sandy over clayey. Malone, Ogdensburg, and Ruse soils are higher in the landscape than Adjidaumo soils and are in coarse-loamy families."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Because of recent changes to Soil Taxonomy this soil now falls into the new great group of Endoaquepts. Competing series are expected to change as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are as follows:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 20 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - from 20 to 69 cm (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\n3. Endoaquepts great group - reduced matrix and redoximorphic concentrations within 51 cm of the mineral soil surface.\n4. Redoximorphic features - Fe depletions, Fe concentrations, reduced matrices which are evidence of aquic conditions.\nSoil Interpretation Record No: NY0360, NY0361, NY0371\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
