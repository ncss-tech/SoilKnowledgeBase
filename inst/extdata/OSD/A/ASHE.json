  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashe series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on gently sloping to very steep ridges and side slopes of the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from felsic or mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks such as granite, hornblende gneiss, granodiorite, biotite gneiss, and high-grade metagraywacke. Mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches near the type location. Slope ranges from 2 to 95 percent.",

Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume throughout. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed. Content of  flakes of mica is few or common throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Where value  is 3 or less, this horizon is less than 7 inches thick. The A horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is saprolite weathered from felsic or intermediate crystalline rocks such as granite, granite gneiss, granodiorite, hornblende gneiss, or mica gneiss. It is similar in color to the Bw horizon or is multicolored. It may have the textures of the Bw horizon or be loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons do not have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is multicolored, weathered bedrock that is partially consolidated but can be dug with hand tools with difficulty.\nThe R horizon is commonly hard, felsic or mafic igneous or high-grade metamorphic rock such as granite, granite gneiss, granodiorite, hornblende gneiss, amphibolite, high-grade metagraywacke, or mica gneiss. The upper boundary is considered as lithic contact where root spacing is greater than 4 inches."

Brookfield soils have B horizons that are 7.5YR and redder.  Buladean and Stecoah soils have paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Cardigan, Ditney, Lordstown, Steinsburg, and Yalesville soils have hard sedimentary or metasedimentary bedrock at depths less than 40 inches and contain fragments of those rocks.  Charlton soils are very deep and formed in glacial till derived mainly from schist, gneiss, or granite.  Chestnut soils have paralithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches but lack hard bedrock within these depths. Delaware soils are very deep and formed in postglacial alluvium, mainly from areas of sandstone, shale, and siltstone.  Dutchess and St. Albans soils are very deep and contain coarse fragments of sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and shale.  Edneyville soils are very deep.  Foresthills (T) and Greenbelt (T) soils are very deep and have mantles of humanly transported materials.  Gallimore soils are very deep and formed in loamy over sandy outwash on outwash plains.  Newport soils are very deep and have C horizons of dense glacial till.  Riverhead have a lithologic discontinuity in the upper 40 inches. Soco and Stecoah soils formed from materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks and contain fragments of those rocks. Wakeman soils formed in residuum over sandstone bedrock on till plains and lake plains and contain fragments of sandstone."

Ashe soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from felsic or mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks such as granite, hornblende gneiss, granodiorite, biotite gneiss, and high-grade metagraywacke. Estimated mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches near the type location.

Brevard, Cowee, Edneytown, Evard, Pigeonroost, Saluda, Saunook, Tate, Trimont, and Watauga soils have argillic horizons. Brownwood, Cashiers, Chandler, Fannin, Micaville,and Watauga soils are in a micaceous or paramicaceous family. Cleveland and Saluda soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 inches. Cullasaja, Greenlee, Thunder, and Peaks soils are in a loamy-skeletal family. Haywood, Plott, Porters, Tuckasegee, and Unaka soils have umbric epipedons. Huntdale, Thunder, and Tusquitee soils have thicker humus-enriched ochric epipedons with color value of 3 or less. All these soils are on ridges and side slopes except for Brevard, Cullasaja, Greenlee, Haywood, Saunook, Tate, Thunder, Tuckasegee, and Tusquitee soils which are on colluvial benches, toe slopes, and fans. Also, soils on cooler, more humid north to east aspects on ridges and side slopes are Cashiers, Huntdale, Plott, Porters, Trimont, and Unaka."

Horizon depths were revised to standards of the most current revision of the Soil Survey Manual (issued 1993). The 2/99 revision updates classification to 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - The zone from 0 to 8 inches (Oe, A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic Horizon - The zone from 8  to 26 inches (Bw horizon).\nLithic Contact - The occurrence of hard bedrock at 31 inches."
