  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer months.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches or more thick.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. Rock fragments, dominantly stone and boulder size, range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum.\nThe A and AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  In some pedons the lower part has chroma of 2.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Redox features with chroma of 2 through 8 range from few to common in the lower part of B horizon.  A few high chroma redox concentrations are in the upper part of the Bw horizon in some pedons.\nThe C horizon if present is stony silty clay loam, stony silty clay, or stony clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.  These are mostly stone size but some pedons have up to 15 percent cobbles."
