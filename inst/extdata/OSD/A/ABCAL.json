  "OVERVIEW": "The Abcal series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale, limestone, and sandstone. Abcal soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

(Cg2 horizon and parts of the Cg1 and Cg3 horizons)\nThe revision of April 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Fluvaquents based on the recognition of a cambic horizon, the estimated CEC/clay ratio, and the linear extensibility (LE) as populated in the NASIS database.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include JLS-AJE-MJD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
