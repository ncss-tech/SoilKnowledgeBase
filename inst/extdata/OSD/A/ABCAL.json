(Parts of the A1, A2, Cg1, and Cg2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 cm. (Cg2 horizon and parts of the Cg1 and Cg3 horizons)\nThe revision of April 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Fluvaquents based on the recognition of a cambic horizon, the estimated CEC/clay ratio, and the linear extensibility (LE) as populated in the NASIS database.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include JLS-AJE-MJD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
