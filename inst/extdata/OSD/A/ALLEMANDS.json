Bellpass, Bessie, and Clovelly soils have salinity of more than 3 dS/m in the control section.  Carlin soils have a water layer at least 6 inches thick below the surface tier.  Barbary, Gentilly, Harris, and Larose soils are mineral soils.  Belhaven, Dare, Dorovan, Mattamuskeet, Pamlico, Ponzer, and Pungo soils have pH value less than 5.5 in all parts of the control section.  Dare, Dorovan, Kenner, Lafitte, Maurepas, and Pungo soils have organic materials with a combined thickness of more than 51 inches.  Also, Pungo soils have horizons in the subsurface layer with less decomposed fiber.  Belhaven, Matamuskeet, Pamlico, and Ponzer soils have coarser textured mineral horizons underlying the organic material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Allemands soils occur on the landward side of the low coastal freshwater marshes.  They are almost continuously flooded unless drained.  The soil formed in 16 to 51 inches of well-decomposed organic material overlying clays.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 64 inches near the type location."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Internal drainage is none and permeability is rapid in the organic material and very slow in the underlying clay horizons.  The water level is 1 foot above the surface to 0.5 foot below the surface.  During tropical storms, floodwaters are up to 4 feet deep or more.  In drained areas, the water table is regulated by a system of levees and pumps and averages 1 to 4 feet below the surface."
