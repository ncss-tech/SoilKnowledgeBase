    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon and thickness of the solum range from 20 to 30 inches.  The epipedon ranges from 0.6 to 4 percent organic carbon, decreasing regularly with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 15.  It is dry in some or all parts from July 15 to October 1 in most years.  Clay content averages 20 to 27 percent in the particle-size control section.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/l, 2/2, 3/l, 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  Very fine and fine, soft to moderately hard gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 65 to 85 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Soft to moderately hard gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Moderately hard cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Total coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 75 to 95 percent.\nThe BCt horizon, when present, is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4 or 5/6.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bruhel (CA), Candlestick (CA), Mallopass (CA), and Miramar (CA) series.  The Bruhel series is greater than 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  The Candlestick series is 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  The Mallopass series is very deep and has mottling between 40 and 80 inches.  Miramar soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the control section and formed over quartz diorite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Abalobadiah soils occur on coastal hills and mountains that have rounded primary and secondary ridges and deep well defined dissections.  Slopes are 9 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 50 to 1300 feet.  The soils are formed in material weathered from sandstone.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bruhel soils and the Dehaven, Hotel, Irmulco, Tramway, and Vizcaino soils.  All are in similar landscape positions.  Dehaven, Hotel, Irmulco and Tramway soils occur out of the direct influence of salt laden winds, have conifer vegetation and lack a mollic epipedon.  Vizcaino soils occur near primary and secondary ridges and are shallow to a paralithic contact."
