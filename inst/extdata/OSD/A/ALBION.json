  "STATES": "KS,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Albion series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained or well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). They formed in loamy Quaternary sediments over sandy alluvium that is at depths of 20 to 40 inches (50 to 102 centimeters). Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F (14 degrees C). Mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters).",
