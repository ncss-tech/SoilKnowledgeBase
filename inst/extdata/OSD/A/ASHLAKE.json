  "REVDATE": "01/2011",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashlake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till which, in places, shows incorporated traces of glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils formed in plane and slightly convex surfaces on ground moraines, end moraines, and bedrock controlled moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
