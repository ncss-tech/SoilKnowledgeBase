These soils formed in residuum derived from tuff, welded tuff, conglomerate and other volcanic or sedimentary rocks.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
