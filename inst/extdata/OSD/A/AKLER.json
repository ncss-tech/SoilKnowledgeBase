  "OVERVIEW": "The Akler series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff, welded tuff, conglomerate and other volcanic or sedimentary rocks.  Akler soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
