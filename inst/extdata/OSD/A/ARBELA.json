    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 48 to more than 60 inches.  These soils have more than 5 percent sand in all parts of the series control section.\nThe Ap or A horizon has color value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam, but includes silty clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. There are few to common strong brown to yellowish brown Fe masses. It is silty clay loam or silty clay with a range of 35 to 45 percent clay. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part but ranges to neutral in the lower part.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is moderately acid to neutral."
