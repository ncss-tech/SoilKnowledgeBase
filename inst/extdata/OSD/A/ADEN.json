  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Aden Series are very deep and poorly drained. They formed on low stream terraces of the Piedmont Plateau in alluvial sediments that dominantly washed from soils of the Triassic area.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

Library soils are 40 to 60 inches to calcareous shale or thin bedded limestone.  McGary soils formed in lacustrine deposits and have a 24 to 40 inch solum.  Parsippany soils are located in large basin areas and have lamella in the control section.  Randolph soils are 20 to 40 inches to limestone bedrock. Savona soils are formed in glacial outwash and underlain with sand and gravel."

These soils developed in alluvial sediments that washed mainly from Triassic upland soils.  Most of the soil areas are subject to occasional flooding, and ponding is common on many areas during winter and spring months.  Water table is commonly at the surface during winter and spring months.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 44 inches.  Mean annual temperature is from 55 to 57 degrees F."
