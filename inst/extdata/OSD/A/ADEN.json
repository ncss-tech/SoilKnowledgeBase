Rock fragments of quartz gravel and siltstone fragments range from 1 to 5 percent in the solum and 1 to 15 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Low chroma mottling is common.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 0 through 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Cr horizon is partially weathered silt stone, sandstone or conglomerate of the Triassic area of the Piedmont Plateau."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crosby, Jeddo, Library, McGary, Parsippany, Randolph and Savona.  The Crosby and Jeddo soils are developed in calcareous glacial till.  Library soils are 40 to 60 inches to calcareous shale or thin bedded limestone.  McGary soils formed in lacustrine deposits and have a 24 to 40 inch solum.  Parsippany soils are located in large basin areas and have lamella in the control section.  Randolph soils are 20 to 40 inches to limestone bedrock. Savona soils are formed in glacial outwash and underlain with sand and gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aden soils are on low, nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces in the Culpeper Basin of the Triassic area of the Piedmont Plateau.  These soils developed in alluvial sediments that washed mainly from Triassic upland soils.  Most of the soil areas are subject to occasional flooding, and ponding is common on many areas during winter and spring months.  Water table is commonly at the surface during winter and spring months.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 44 inches.  Mean annual temperature is from 55 to 57 degrees F."

The well drained Bermudian and the moderately well to somewhat poorly drained Roland soils are on slightly lower elevations in the landscape and have thinner and coarser textured subsoils. The Arcola, Nestoria and Reaville are developed in residuum from silt stone and sandstone and are shallower to bedrock.  DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Slow runoff and slow internal drainage."
