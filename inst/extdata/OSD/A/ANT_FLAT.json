  "OVERVIEW": "Ant Flat soils are very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on terraces and mountain slopes.  They formed in colluvium, residuum, and alluvium from calcareous sandstone and some quartzite, conglomerate, limestone and shale.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 70 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days or more in 7 out of 10 years during the summer and are continually moist for 60 to 90 days of the 120 days following the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
