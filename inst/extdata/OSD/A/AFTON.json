Additional work is needed to separate.\nDifferentia from Sawmill and Whitewood series needs further study and refinement.\nA new pedon will be needed.  The pedon used for this OSD does not fit the series pH ranges or depth to carbonates.  The values for pH in the A horizon are slightly higher (8.0) than the slightly alkaline reaction class.  Also, laboratory records indicate effervescence tests confirm the presence of carbonates in some parts of the A horizon.\nCation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data from KSSL\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, eleventh edition, 2010.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLab characterization data-(95P0226) is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln Nebraska; Iowa State University:  107AIA1924IA041OSD, 1968IA161001, 1973IA119001, 1977IA141001, 1985IA143001, 1986IA093001, 1987IA035001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
