  "OVERVIEW": "The Afton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 100 to more than 200 centimeters of loess and local alluvium and the underlying till.  These soils are in upland drainageways on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 638 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Additional work is needed to separate.\nDifferentia from Sawmill and Whitewood series needs further study and refinement.\nA new pedon will be needed.  The pedon used for this OSD does not fit the series pH ranges or depth to carbonates.  The values for pH in the A horizon are slightly higher (8.0) than the slightly alkaline reaction class.  Also, laboratory records indicate effervescence tests confirm the presence of carbonates in some parts of the A horizon.\nCation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data from KSSL\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, eleventh edition, 2010.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLab characterization data-(95P0226) is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln Nebraska; Iowa State University:  107AIA1924IA041OSD, 1968IA161001, 1973IA119001, 1977IA141001, 1985IA143001, 1986IA093001, 1987IA035001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
