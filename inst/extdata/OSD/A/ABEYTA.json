  "OVERVIEW": "The Abeyta series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Abeyta soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
