    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aceitunas soils are on foot slopes, alluvial fans, and valleys associated with limestone hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  They formed in fine-textured regolith that washed from the surrounding limestone hills.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 62 to 72 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coto, Matanzas, and Tanama soils.  Coto soils are on similar to higher positions, are less red in the subsoil, have more clay in the control section, and are Oxisols.  Matanzas soils are on similar positions, are shallow to hard limestone bedrock, have redder subsoils, and are Oxisols.  Tanama soils are on similar to higher positions, are shallow to hard limestone bedrock, have mixed mineralogy in the control section, and are Alfisols."
