    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arnor soils are on toeslopes of hills. They formed in slope alluvium and alluvium derived locally from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum of Precambrian granite bedrock. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,400 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
