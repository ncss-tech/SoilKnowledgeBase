  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The soil between depths of 5 an 18 inches becomes moist about the end of October or early November and remains moist until late April or early May.  Mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 67 degrees F.  The difference between the average summer and winter soil temperature is 28 to 36 degrees F.  The solum contains up to 10 percent 2mm to 7cm angular fragments.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through mildly alkaline throughout the soil profile.  Organic matter is more than 1.2 percent to a depth of 20 inches or more.\nThe A1 horizon is very dark gray, dark gray, very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown or grayish brown (10YR 3/1, 4/1, 3/2, 4/2, 5/2) or dark brown or brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2).  It is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  A transitional A3 horizon or B1 horizon is usually present.\nThe B2t horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, dark brown, brown, dark yellowish brown or yellowish brown (10YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 4/4, 5/4) or are dark brown or brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, 4/4, 5/4).  It is heavy loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and has about 5 to 11 percent more clay (absolute) than the A horizon.\nIn some pedons a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6) C horizon occurs directly above the paralithic contact.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arujo soils are on uplands with slopes of 9 to 75 percent.  They formed from metamorphic and igneous (primarily granitic) rocks.  Elevations are 1,000 to 5,800 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal having warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches, some in the form of snow.  Average January temperature is about 39 degrees F, average July temperature is about 72 degrees F, mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 150 to 225 days."
