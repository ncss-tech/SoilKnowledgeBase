  "OVERVIEW": "The Abaft series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sands from mixed sources. Abaft soils are on stabilized dunes and beach areas along the coast. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F (17 degrees C.)",

Moist color is 10YR 5/2, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4.\nTextures are loamy sand or sand throughout.\nCoarse fragments are usually absent but in some cases there may be 1 to 2 percent small gravels."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arnold, Briones, Calhi, Corralitos, Delhi, Monoridge, Monvero and Tujunga series. Arnold soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and have 7.5YR hues in the C horizons. Briones and Monoridge soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock with 7.5YR hues in the C horizons. Calhi soils are calcareous and strongly alkaline throughout, and have mean annual soil temperatures of 67 degrees F. Corralitos soils formed in sandy alluvium on alluvial fans, and are moderately acid. Delhi soils do not have rock fragments and stratification, and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by 25 to 35 degrees F. Monvero soils are calcareous and are slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. Tujunga soils formed in alluvium on alluvial fans and floodplains, and have rock fragments of 2 to 35 percent throughout."

The soils formed in eolian and wave reworked sands from mixed sources. Elevations are 1 to 300 feet (1 to 95 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with potential fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 34 inches (330 to 864 mm), the mean annual temperature is 59 to 73 degrees F. (15 to 23 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 365 days."
