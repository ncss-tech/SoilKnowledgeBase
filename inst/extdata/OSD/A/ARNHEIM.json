  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil typically is strongly acid to neutral. Color, arrangement, and thickness of horizons vary considerably because of the nature of the parent materials.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is typically mucky silt loam, but the range includes silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and loamy very fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. The remaining C horizons typically have 5YR hue but include individual horizons of 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Textures within the control section are variable in their order of occurrence but commonly are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and loamy very fine sand. Thin individual horizons of fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam occur but the control section averages between 8 and 18 percent clay and has greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Below a depth of 102 centimeters, thin layers of silty clay loam, loamy sand, or sand occur along with the textures listed in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arnheim soils are on flood plains of major streams. The topography is level or nearly level with slope gradients from 0 to 1 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 710 to 890 millimeters, and mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C."

Representative wet soil moisture status ranges from the surface to 76 centimeters below the surface at times throughout the year. Flooding is occasional to frequent for brief to long periods in March to November."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The previous draft of the series had the classification as coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, frigid Aeric Fluvaquents. Because of red parent material that remains red after citrate-dithionite extraction, the requirement for low chroma should be waived.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
