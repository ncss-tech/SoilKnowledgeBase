  "OVERVIEW": "The Astrobee series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy gypsiferous eolian deposits. These nearly level soils are on interdunes, low dunes, and relict shorelines in dune fields. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

Mamtrack soils have gleyed hues within the PSCS and are found on relict shorelines. Peligro soils are formed in strongly sloping relict playa dunes. Shot soils have hues of 5YR and 7.5YR and have less than 60 percent gypsum in the PSCS. Whitebasin soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30). Wulie soils have less than 35 percent selenite crystals in the PSCS and have a lacustrine horizon at the bottom of the PSCS. Yesum soils have sandy loam and finer textures and are moderately to strongly saline."
