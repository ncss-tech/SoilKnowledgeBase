Some pedons have mucky texture modifiers.\nThe E or Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 or less or it is neutral. Texture is sand or fine sand. Redoximorphic features, where present, consists of masses of oxidized iron in shades of red, brown, or yellow and iron depletions in shades of white, gray or olive.\nThe upper Bh horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less.

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches and mean annual temperature is about 65 to 70 degrees F."

None of these associated soils have spodic horizons within 80 inches of the surface. Chipley and Foxworth soils are on upland and side slopes and are better drained. Dorovan and Pamlico soils have organic surfaces. Osier soils have an ochric or albic surface horizon. Pickney soils have an umbric epipedon more than 24 inches thick. Plummer soils have an argillic horizon at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Allanton soils are poorly or very poorly drained. Runoff is very slow. Permeability is moderately rapid throughout but is impeded by a high water table. A water table is within 6 inches of the surface for 3 to 5 months during most years. It is at or on the surface for periods of 1 to 3 months in some years. It is within depths of 24 inches for 6 to 9 months in most years. In the lower lying areas water may stand for 2 to 4 months in most years."

Natural vegetation consists of sweet bay, blackgum, sweetgum, red maple and some slash pine. The understory consists of buckwheattree (titi), waxmyrtle, hammock sweet azalea, gallberry, and similar species and pineland threeawn. A few areas are drained, cleared, and in tame pastures."

    "content": "REMARKS: This revision changes the series classification to recognize the 1992 amendments to Soil Taxonomy that introduces changes in classification of Spodosols.\n09/2008.  The OSD was reclassified from Grossarenic Alaquods to Arenic Umbric Alaquods.  These soils have both the Grossarenic and Umbric soil features; however, classify as Arenic Umbric Alaquods by virtue of the order of the Alaquod subgroups in the 10th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  These soils would classify as Grossarenic Umbric Alaquods if such existed in the Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon-zone from the surface to a depth of 18 inches (A1, A2).\nAlbic horizon-zone from 18 to 52 inches (E1, E2).\nSpodic horizon-zone from 52 to 80 inches (Bh).\nAquic condition-endosaturation throughout soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Characterization Lab., IFAS, UOF\nS3-14-(1-8), S4-5-(1-7)\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nFL0295 ALLANTON    0-  2   65- 70  230-310  50- 60    20- 150\nFL0397 ALLANTON    0-  2   65- 70  230-310  50- 60    20- 150\nFL0489 ALLANTON    0-  2   65- 70  230-310  50- 60    20- 150\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nFL0295 NONE            0-0.5  APPARENT FEB-SEP  60-60\nFL0397 COMMON          0-0.5  APPARENT DEC-MAY  60-60\nFL0489 NONE             -     APPARENT    -     60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nFL0295  0-18  LS LFS                  0-  0 100-100  8-12  10- 25\nFL0295  0-18  S FS                    0-  0 100-100  3- 8   4-  8\nFL0295 18-56  S FS LS                 0-  0 100-100  3-12   1-  8\nFL0295 56-80  S FS LS                 0-  0 100-100  3-12  10- 30\nFL0397  0-18  S FS                    0-  0 100-100  3- 8   4-  8\nFL0397  0-18  LS LFS                  0-  0 100-100  8-12  10- 25\nFL0397 18-52  S FS LS                 0-  0 100-100  3-12   1-  8\nFL0397 52-80  S FS LS                 0-  0 100-100  3-12  10- 30\nFL0489  0-18  MK-S MK-FS MK-LFS       0-  0 100-100  3-12  15- 30\nFL0489 18-56  S FS                    0-  0 100-100  1- 8   1-  8\nFL0489 56-80  S FS LS                 0-  0 100-100  3-12  10- 30\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
