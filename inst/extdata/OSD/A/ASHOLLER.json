  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the lithic contact ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle size control section has a matrix texture of loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 30 to 60 percent sand.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 75 percent with 20 to 50\npercent channers or angular pebbles and 0 to 20 percent semirounded stones or flagstones.  Mica flakes are common throughout the soil profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3\nthrough 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe bedrock consists of hard, micaceous schist interbedded with gneiss.  This bedrock is folded and stands at 20 to 85 degrees.  The schist may be weathered in the upper few inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Asholler soils are on mountainsides, rolling foothills, and exhumed knolls.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from weathered micaceous schist and gneiss.  These soils may be influenced by granite from outcropping contiguous to the schist and gneiss deposits.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 6,300 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and ranges from 10 to 14 inches\nwith about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. and ranges from 30 to 44 degrees F.  Estimated frost-free season ranges from 80 to 110 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
