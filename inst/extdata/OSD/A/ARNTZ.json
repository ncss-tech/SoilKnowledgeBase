Arntz soils formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from gypsiferous mudstone and siltstone with some influence from eolian sediments, and sandstone and limestone.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 160 days."
