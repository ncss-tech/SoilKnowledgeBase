These soils are dry for 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 55 to 70 days during the 120 days following June 21  Depth to the top of the nitric horizon is 3 to 10 inches.  Depth to the base of the nitric horizon is less than 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Btkn horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam or loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  SAR is 13 to 25.

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. and the average summer air temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."
