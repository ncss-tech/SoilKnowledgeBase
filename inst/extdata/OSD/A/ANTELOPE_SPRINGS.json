  "OVERVIEW": "The Antelope Springs series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on fan terraces and alluvial plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

These soils are dry for 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 55 to 70 days during the 120 days following June 21  Depth to the top of the nitric horizon is 3 to 10 inches.  Depth to the base of the nitric horizon is less than 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Btkn horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam or loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  SAR is 13 to 25.  Calcium carbonate is 10 to 40 percent.\nThe Bk or Bkn horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.
