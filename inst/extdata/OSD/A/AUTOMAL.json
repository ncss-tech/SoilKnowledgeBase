  "OVERVIEW": "The Automal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite and shale. Automal soils are on fan remnants and beach plains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
