  "OVERVIEW": "The Acrelane series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granodiorite and similar granitic rocks.  Acrelane soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
