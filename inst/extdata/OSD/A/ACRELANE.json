Koontz soils have a loam or clay loam argillic horizon with dominantly fine sands and finer.  Roloc soils average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Tulecan and Ubehebe soils are moist for 12 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.  Ubehebe soils also are dominated by gravel greater than 5 mm in the particle-size control section and have texture of loam in the argillic horizon."

Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 915 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 135 days."
