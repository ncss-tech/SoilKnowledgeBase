  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Austin series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from chalk. These soils are on nearly level to sloping erosional uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 915 mm (36 in) and the mean air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).",
