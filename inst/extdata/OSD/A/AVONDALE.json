  "OVERVIEW": "The Avondale series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks.  Avondale soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Avondale soils are on nearly level flood plains and alluvial fans.  Elevation ranges from 400 to 2500 feet.  They formed in medium and moderately fine textured alluvium derived from mixed basic and acid igneous rocks, quartzite and limestone.  Avondale soils are in an arid or semiarid continental climate.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 3 to 10 inches and falls mainly during the summer and winter.  The soil receives additional moisture during summer in runoff from adjacent soils.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 71 to 75 degrees F.; and the frost-free period is from 250 to 350 days."
