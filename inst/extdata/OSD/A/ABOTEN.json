  "OVERVIEW": "The Aboten series consist of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Aboten soils are on erosional fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
