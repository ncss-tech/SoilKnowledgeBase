  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Depth to soft or hard bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Some Pedons with paralithic materials may not reach a lithic contact within 80 inches. Rock fragments of rounded vein quartz and red siltstone channers range from 0 to 5 percent in the Ap and Bt horizons.  Rock fragments of red siltstone channers range from 0 to 35 percent in the 2Bt and 15 to 55 percent in the 2C horizons.  Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Subhorizons may have textures of clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Subhorizons may have textures of clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2Cr horizon, where present, is dense in place and generally can be excavated with standard hand equipment.  It is weathered red beds of variable grain size and bed thickness."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ashburn soils are on broad, convex interfluves in the Culpeper Basin of the northern Piedmont.  These soils formed in reworked alluvium and the underlying red Triassic interbedded siltstone, fine-grained sandstone, and shale residuum.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."
