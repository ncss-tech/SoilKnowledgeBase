(3 to 8 inches thick)\nBt1--6 to 26 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine and medium roots; nearly continuous clay films or stress surfaces on faces of peds; common fragments and small sandstones ranging from 0.8 to 2.5 cm in diameter make up about 10 percent of the volume; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.\nBt2--26 to 38 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine and medium roots; nearly continuous clay films or stress surfaces on faces of peds; common sandstones ranging from 1.5 to 15 cm in diameter make up about 15 percent of the volume; very strongly acid; clear irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt subhorizons is 17 to 34 inches)\nCr--38 to 45 inches; stratified sandstone, siltstone and buhrstone fragments that have a pale brown (10YR 6/3) interior; brown (7.5YR 4/2) silt coatings between the fractures; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) stains throughout rock structure; rock layers can be cut with a spade."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction of the soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Fragments of siltstone or sandstone ranging from 0.2 cm to as much as 20 cm across make up from 0 to 20 percent of the volume. Texture loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nSome pedons have an E horizon. Where present, it ranges from 3 to 9 inches in thickness. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles in shades of brown or red range from none to common.  Fragments of siltstone or sandstone ranging from 0.2 cm to more than 2.5 cm across make up from 0 to more than 20 percent of the volume with the amount increasing with depth. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay or clay.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, gray or red range from few to many.  Some pedons have no dominant color and are mottled in shades of red, yellow, brown, gray or olive.  Fragments of siltstone or sandstone ranging from 0.2 cm to more than 2.5 cm in diameter make up from 0 to more than 20 percent of the volume with the amount increasing with depth.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon. Where present, It has similar colors and textures as the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Mica flakes range from none to many.\nSome pedons have a C horizon. Where present, it has s 5 to 10 inches thick with similar colors as the lower part of the Bt horizon. Mica flakes range from none to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of alternating layers of sandstone, siltstone, or buhrstone; or it has thick beds of any one of the above.  In fresh exposures, it can be cut with a spade."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arundel soils are on upland dissected ridge tops and hill sides of the Southern Coastal Plain.  They formed in marine deposits of acid clays overlying horizontally bedded sandstone, buhrstone and siltstone of the Tallahatta and Naheola formations.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. The climate is humid subtropical.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 52 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Beatrice, Boswell, Cantuche, Lauderdale, Luverne, Ruston, Smithdale, Susquehanna, Sweatman and Williamsville series.  The moderately well drained Beatrice and Boswell and the somewhat poorly drained Susquehanna soils are on similar positions and are very deep. In addition, the Beatrice soils have more clay in the control section and are deep to clayey shale while Boswell soils are Alfisols. Cantuche and Lauderdale soils are on similar positions and are shallow to horizontally bedded sandstone, buhrstone, and siltstone.  In additions, Lauderdale soils have fine-loamy control sections and have argillic horizons while Cantuche soils are loamy-skeletal.  Luverne, Sweatman, and Williamsville soils are on similar positions in the landscape.  Luverne, Sweatman and Williamsville soils are on similar positions, have mixed mineralogy and are very deep.  Ruston and Smithdale soils formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments, are on higher ridge tops and side slopes, have fine-loamy control sections and are very deep."
