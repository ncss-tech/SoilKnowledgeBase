These soils formed in pedisediments, residuum, and colluvium derived from tuffs and other basic volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,895 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold moist winters and warm Dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
