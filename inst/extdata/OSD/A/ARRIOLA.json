  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact with siltstone or sandstone.  Siliceous pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the A and E horizons.  The control section ranges in clay content from 40 to 60 percent.  Base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent immediately above the paralithic contact.\nThe A horizon has color with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The E horizon has color that is about 1 or 2 units of value higher than the A horizon.  Reaction of the A horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The E horizon is very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt1 horizon has color with hue of 2.5YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles range from none to many in shades of gray and brown.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has color with hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Mottles in shades of gray, red and brown are few to common.  In some pedons the matrix is mottled in these colors.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt3 horizon has color with hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It contains mottles in shades of red and brown.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Cr layer is grayish tuffaceous siltstone, sandstone, or interbedded sandstone and siltstone and has mottled strata in shades of brown that range from 1/4 to 1 inch thick."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ichetucknee and Spurger in the same family, and the similar Cadeville, Counts, Grubbs and Rosenwall series.  Ichetucknee soils are underlain by soft limestone.  Spurger soils are underlain by sandy and loamy sediments on low terraces.  Cadeville, Counts, and Grubbs soils have a base saturation of more than 60 percent and lack a paralithic contact within 40 inches.  Rosenwall soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arriola soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping uplands.  Slope gradients are mostly from 1 to 5 percent but range up to 8 percent.  The soil formed in siltstones, tuffaceous clay, and sandstones mainly of the Catahoula, Whitset, and Manning formations.  The climate is subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 66 to 68 degrees F., annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E index exceeds 64."
