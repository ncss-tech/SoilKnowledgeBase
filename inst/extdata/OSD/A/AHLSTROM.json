    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual temperature is about 42 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F. These soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on an aridic regime.\nThe A horizon is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.  It is brown to strong brown, reddish brown or yellowish brown, and has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, an chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe A horizons that have values less than 3.5 moist and chromas less than 4 moist are less than 10 inches thick or less than 1/3 the thickness of the solum.\nThe Bt horizon ranges from brown to strong brown, yellowish brown or reddish yellow, and has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The particle size control section averages silty clay loam with about 35 to 45 percent clay but the particle size control section is stratified and texture of individual strata includes loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and silty clay.\nThe Bk horizon ranges from reddish yellow to reddish brown or yellowish brown and has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 4 to 8.  It averages silty clay loam, but is stratified loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay and has loamy sand or gravel lenses.  This horizon has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium from limestone and shale.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 80 days.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."

In 1999 it was decided as described this soil had an argillic horizon. This needs to be confirmed in the field. On floodplain landforms the clay films are particularly questionable.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
