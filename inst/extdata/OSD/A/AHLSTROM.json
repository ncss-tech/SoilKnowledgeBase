  "OVERVIEW": "The Ahlstrom series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from limestone and shale.  Permeability is slow.  These soils are on nearly level flood plains and gently sloping valleys at elevations of 7,600 to 8,300 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

These soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on an aridic regime.\nThe A horizon is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.  It is brown to strong brown, reddish brown or yellowish brown, and has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, an chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe A horizons that have values less than 3.5 moist and chromas less than 4 moist are less than 10 inches thick or less than 1/3 the thickness of the solum.\nThe Bt horizon ranges from brown to strong brown, yellowish brown or reddish yellow, and has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The particle size control section averages silty clay loam with about 35 to 45 percent clay but the particle size control section is stratified and texture of individual strata includes loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and silty clay.\nThe Bk horizon ranges from reddish yellow to reddish brown or yellowish brown and has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 4 to 8.  It averages silty clay loam, but is stratified loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay and has loamy sand or gravel lenses.  This horizon has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

In 1999 it was decided as described this soil had an argillic horizon. This needs to be confirmed in the field.
