  "OVERVIEW": "The Amesha series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills or escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
