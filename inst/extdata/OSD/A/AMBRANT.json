  "OVERVIEW": "The Ambrant series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from igneous rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
