  "OVERVIEW": "The Adit series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in residuum from granite or other coarse grained igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils occur on hillslopes, ridges and pediments in foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Modess soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches of the soil surface and accumulations of calcium carbonate in one or more subsoil horizons.  Rockerjohn soils are very deep and have a weighted average of less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Both have mollic surface horizons.  They occur on more linear to concave landscape positions relative to the Adit series."

Adit soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.  Gravels throughout the profile are primarily fine pea gravel less than 7 mm in diameter."
