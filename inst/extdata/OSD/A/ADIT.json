Modess soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches of the soil surface and accumulations of calcium carbonate in one or more subsoil horizons.  Rockerjohn soils are very deep and have a weighted average of less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Both have mollic surface horizons.  They occur on more linear to concave landscape positions relative to the Adit series."
