Kettleman soils are in the Central California Coast Range (MLRA 15), Panoche soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17), and Voyager soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), all these soils receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Adelino soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans, fan remnants, and piedmont slopes at elevations of about 3,500 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent ranging to 5 percent.  The soils formed in old alluvium from granite, quartzite, schist, and limestone.  At the type location the climate is semiarid continental.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches to over 1/2 of the total falling in June through September.  Mean annual temperature is about 65 F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 14.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."
