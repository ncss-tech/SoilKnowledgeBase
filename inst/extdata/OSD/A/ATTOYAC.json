    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 3 to 20 inches.  Rounded quartzite and ironstone pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent by volume throughout. The weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent and the silt content ranges from 20 to 30 percent. Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has colors in shades of brown or red with hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. Some pedons have dark surface layers with value of 3, but these layers are less than 7 inches thick. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid unless limed. Some pedons have a red or dark red BA horizon.\nThe E horizon, where present hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid unless limed.\nThe Bw horizon, where present hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid unless limed.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has colors in shades of red with hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. The texture is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has colors in shades of red or brown with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bistineau, Caledonia, Darbonne, Elrose, Petal, and Sallisaw series in the same family, and the similar Bernaldo, Ruston, and Woden series in closely related families. Bistineau and Caledonia soils contain 35 percent or more silt in the control section. Darbonne soils have 15 to 60 percent ironstone fragments in some subhorizon and have sola 40 to 60 inches thick. Elrose soils have 35 percent clay or more in the middle or lower part of the Bt horizon. Petal soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the middle or lower part of the Bt horizon with colors in hue of 10YR. Sallisaw soils are very gravelly in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Bernaldo soils are glossic and have colors in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in the upper part of the Bt horizon. Woden soils have coarse-loamy control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Attoyac soils are mainly on nearly level to gently sloping Pleistocene terraces in the Southern Coastal Plain, but some areas are on strongly sloping terraces and escarpments. Areas are about 25 to 100 feet above present streams. Slope gradients are dominantly less than 3 percent, but range up to 15 percent on escarpments. Average annual temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 240 to 260 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 550 feet above sea level. The annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 46 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 66 to 80."

Besner soils have coarse-loamy control sections, have a glossic horizon, and are on mounds. Bienville soils have sandy control sections and are on slightly lower terraces."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pastureland and woodland. Some areas are cropped to corn, small grains, or truck crops. Native vegetation is mixed pine and hardwood forest consisting of shortleaf and loblolly pine, southern red oak, and sweetgum. Pastures are mainly improved bermuda grasses, bahiagrass or common bermuda grass. Pastures are commonly overseeded with crimson clover, arrowleaf clovers, vetch, or singletary peas."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 2002 to allow very strongly acid reaction in the epipedon, and to allow a thin E or Bw horizon above the argillic horizon.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and A horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 80 inches (Bt1 to Bt5 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL, S74TX-347-1, S88TX-347-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
