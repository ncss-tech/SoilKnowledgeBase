  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 63 degrees F. The soil between 10 to 29 inches or a lithic contact is usually moist in some part from November 30 until May 15. It is moist for more than 50 consecutive days in the winter. Organic matter is 1.0 to 2.5 percent to 20 inches and decreases regularly with depth. Angular and subangular shale fragments make up 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown and dark grayish brown (10YR 5/2, 4/2).  Moist colors range from very dark grayish brown and dark brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3). It is a loam or clay loam, has 20 to 35 percent clay, and is very channery. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a C horizon."

Anaheim, Agueda, Conejo, and Gazos have less than 35 percent rock fragments. Anaheim soils have a paralithic contact. Agueda and Conejo soils are alluvial soils and are deeper than 40 inches. Gamboa and Lucia and soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 59 degrees F. Millrace soils are greater than 60 inches deep and have formed in alluvium from basic igneous rocks. Pottinger soils have formed in alluvium and are greater than 60 inches deep."

Elevations are about 1,500 to 4,300 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 44 degrees F., average July temperature is about 81 degrees F., and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 to 62 degrees F. Frost-free season is 175 to 225 days."
