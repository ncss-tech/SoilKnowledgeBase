Redoximorphic features consisting of iron depletions or concentrations occur in the spodic horizon within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface. Rock fragments, mainly stones, cobbles, and gravel, range from 5 to 35 percent, by volume, throughout the mineral soil.\nThe O horizon ranges from slightly decomposed to highly decomposed plant material. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 3. Some pedons have an Ap horizon that is hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction and includes mucky modifier in some pedons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid. Thickness of the A or Ap horizon is 0 to 8 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or very friable, but up to 25 percent firm areas may be present. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3. Texture, consistence and reaction are similar to the Bh horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is loamy fine sand to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. It is massive or has plate-like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm. Vertical desiccation cracks 20 inches or more apart are in some pedons. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid. Some pedons have a thin C horizon above the Cd horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Ampersand and Foxpaw series are in the same family. Ampersand soils have 6 percent or more organic carbon in the spodic horizon. Foxpaw soils have a friable till substratum.\nSimilar series include the Brayton, Cabot, Lyme, Peacham, Suny, and Westbury. Brayton, Cabot, Lyme, Peacham, and Suny soils do not have a spodic horizon. Westbury soils have a fragipan horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Adirondack soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils in slightly concave areas and shallow drainage ways of glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent, and is dominantly 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in Wisconsin age till derived mainly from igneous and meta-igneous rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F; and the mean annual frost-free days ranges from 90 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 600 to 2200 feet above sea level."

Also associated are the very poorly drained Tughill soils and the poorly drained Lyme soils that have more friable substratums."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previous classification was in the Epiaquods great group. This was changed to Endoaquods based on new Taxonomy guidance regarding Cd horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are as follows:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from 4 to 6 inches (E horizon).\n2. Spodic horizon - from 6 to 18 inches (Bh, Bhs and Bs horizons).\n3. Endoaquods great group - redoximorphic features in the albic or spodic horizons and within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.\n4. Redoximorphic Features - iron concentrations are evidence of aquic conditions (E, Bh, Bhs, and Bs horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Engineering test data, and characterization data are available for Oneida County, New York for pedon S84NY065-5 from the Cornell University Soil Survey Laboratory.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
