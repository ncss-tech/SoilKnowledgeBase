  "OVERVIEW": "The Adirondack Series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, loamy soils overlying dense till. They are in shallow depressions, on footslopes, and along drainageways on till plains in uplands and mountainous areas. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and moderately low to moderately high in the dense substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

    "content": "REMARKS: Previous classification was in the Epiaquods great group. This was changed to Endoaquods based on new Taxonomy guidance regarding Cd horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are as follows:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from 4 to 6 inches (E horizon).\n2. Spodic horizon - from 6 to 18 inches (Bh, Bhs and Bs horizons).\n3. Endoaquods great group - redoximorphic features in the albic or spodic horizons and within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.\n4. Redoximorphic Features - iron concentrations are evidence of aquic conditions (E, Bh, Bhs, and Bs horizons)."
