The soil between the depth of 8 to 28 inches is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April  15.  The  particle size class ranges from 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly acid throughout.  Mineralogy is influenced by amourphous material.  Coarse and very coarse sand ranges from 5 to 10 percent throughout.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 6/3, 7/3; 10YR 5/3, 6/4 or 7/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 5/3, 6/3; 10YR 3/2, 4/2 or 4/3.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam at the surface and gravelly sandy loam in the lower A horizon.  Angular obsidian fragments 2 to 25 mm in diameter occur at the surface  as  a gravel pavement and below that gravel content is 15 to 35 percent.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 5YR 6/6, 7/6; 7.5YR 4/6, 6/4, 6/6; 10YR 6/4 or  6/6.  Moist color is 5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8; 7.5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/6 or 10YR 6/4.  It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, cobbly clay loam, very cobbly clay or very stony clay.  The weighted average in the upper 20 inches of the argillic is 35 to 45 percent clay and  35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments consist of 10 to 45 percent pebbles, 5 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 30 percent stones.  Some pedons have a B3 horizon."
