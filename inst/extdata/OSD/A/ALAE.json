  "OVERVIEW": "The Alae series consists of deep, excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from alluvium from volcanic ash.  Alae soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation (MAP) is about 431 millimeters (17 inches), and the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.).",
