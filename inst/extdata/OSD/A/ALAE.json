It is cobbly sandy loam or gravely sand loam. It average 70 to 100 percent sand, and 5 to 35 percent gravel or cobble. It has weak fine granular structure and is friable or very friable. It ranges from pH 6.8 to 7.4.\nThe B horizon has hue 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry. It can be stratified and has textures of sandy loam, coarse sand and very coarse sand.  A few volcanic ash bands l/4 to 3/4 inch in thickness are present in the B horizon in some pedons.
