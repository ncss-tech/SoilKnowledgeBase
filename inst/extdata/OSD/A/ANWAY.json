  "OVERVIEW": "The Anway series consist of deep well drained soils that form in old mixed alluvium derived from granite, rhyolite, andesite, limestone and some basalt.  These soils are on valley plains.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees.",

Avenal soils have hue redder than 10YR.  Bucklebar soil's base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches, with some extending to 50 inches.  Bryman, Dutchflat, Garlock, Hi Vista, and Neuralia soils are in the Mohave Desert.  Avenal and Milham soils are in the San Joaquin Valley.  These soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Bryman, Garlock, Neuralia, and Palomas soils have argillic horizons that are more than 20 inches thick.  Dutchflat soils contain more than 15 percent gravel in the PSCS.  Hi Vista soils are moderately deep over granite bedrock.  Milham soils are effervescent throughout the entire profile."

The regolith is formed in old alluvium from mixed sources including granite, rhyolite, andesite, limestone and possibly basalt. These soils are at elevations of 2,000 to 2,400 feet in a warm, arid and semiarid continental climate. The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F. The average annual rainfall ranges from 8 to 11 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 250 to 280 days."
