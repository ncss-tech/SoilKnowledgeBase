They formed in layered volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,500 to 3,500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 1 to 8 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."

Mox soils have distinct albic and spodic diagnostic horizons and lack the layered volcanic ash mantle.  Stetattle soils lack a contrasting particle-size control section and have a pachic umbric epipedon.  Treen soils are shallow (less than 50 cm) to a lithic contact and lack a contrasting particle-size control section."
