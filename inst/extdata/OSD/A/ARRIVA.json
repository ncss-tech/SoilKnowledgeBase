  "OVERVIEW": "The Arriva series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in layered volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Arriva soils are found on slopes of 0 to 35 percent on ridges and passes of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,540 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
