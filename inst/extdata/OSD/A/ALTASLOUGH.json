It is saline-sodic below the A horizon, and the electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio increase with depth. Gypsum may occur in all horizons, and its presence is dependent on reclamation practices.\nThe Ap horizon has color of 10YR 4/2; 5Y 4/1, 5/1, 5/2 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2; 5Y 2/1, 3/1, 3/2 or 5/2. Dry color value of 6 and moist color value of 5 occur below the mollic epipedon. Clay content is 27 to 35 percent.

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; medium runoff; slow permeability. Altaslough soils were favored by Native Americans for encampments, as evidenced by findings of cultural artifacts, due to their location at slightly higher elevations along the Fresno Slough. They are considered to be drained because of the presence of dams and reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada, pumping from the water table, use of tile and interceptor drains and the filling and leveling of the sloughs in the vicinity.  They are protected from major flooding by large flood control levees and reservoirs."
