Altaslough soils were favored by Native Americans for encampments, as evidenced by findings of cultural artifacts, due to their location at slightly higher elevations along the Fresno Slough. They are considered to be drained because of the presence of dams and reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada, pumping from the water table, use of tile and interceptor drains and the filling and leveling of the sloughs in the vicinity.  They are protected from major flooding by large flood control levees and reservoirs."
