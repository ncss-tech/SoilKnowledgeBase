The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days. The particle size control section is silt loam with 18 to 25 percent clay and has a weighted average of 1 to 20 percent basalt rock fragments. The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist. It has weak or moderate granular, blocky or platy structure. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw and BA horizons have value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. It is silt loam or loam with weak or moderate blocky or prismatic structure. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist and chroma of 1, 2, or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is moderately to very strongly alkaline."
