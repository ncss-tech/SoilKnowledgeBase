  "OVERVIEW": "The Almota series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and colluvium from basalt. These soils are on plateaus, benches, hills and canyon sides. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.   The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days. The particle size control section is silt loam with 18 to 25 percent clay and has a weighted average of 1 to 20 percent basalt rock fragments. The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist. It has weak or moderate granular, blocky or platy structure. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw and BA horizons have value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. It is silt loam or loam with weak or moderate blocky or prismatic structure. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist and chroma of 1, 2, or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is moderately to very strongly alkaline."
