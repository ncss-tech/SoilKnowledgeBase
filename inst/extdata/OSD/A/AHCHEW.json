  "OVERVIEW": "The Ahchew series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from altered volcanic rocks with eolian additions of volcanic ash.  Ahchew soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
