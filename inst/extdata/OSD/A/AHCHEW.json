  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ahchew soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from altered volcanic rock with eolian additions of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,730 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
