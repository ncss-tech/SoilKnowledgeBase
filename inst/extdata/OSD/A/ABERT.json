These soils formed in eolian material and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. The source of the volcanic ash is ancestral Mt. Mazama. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,500 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Kunceider soils are ashy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons, and are on adjacent lava plains. Morehouse soils have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section and are on adjacent stable dunes.  Wegert soils are ashy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons, and are on adjacent lava plains."
