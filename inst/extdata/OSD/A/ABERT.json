  "OVERVIEW": "The Abert series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed volcanic rocks and volcanic ash.  Abert soils are on lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
