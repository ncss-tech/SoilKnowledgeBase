  "OVERVIEW": "The Amene series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from limestone and dolomite. The Amene soils are on mountain crests and side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
