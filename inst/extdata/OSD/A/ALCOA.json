  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 50 to more than 90 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Base saturation in the Bt horizon ranges from about 8 to 25 percent.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid strongly acid except where limed.  Rock fragments are mostly gravels, pebbles, or cobbles of sandstone and shale and range from 0 to 15 in each horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10R or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Hue of 5YR is allowed if it occupies less than 50 percent of the colors in the upper 40 inches of the Bt.  Value of 4 or 5 is also allowed below the upper 40 inches.  Some pedons have brown or yellow mottles in the lower part.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam, clay, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam."

Slopes are dominantly 2 to 15 percent, but range from 2 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from soils formed from reddish calcareous sandstone or quartzose limestone.  At a site about 15 miles from the type location, the average annual air temperature is 59.5 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 50 inches."
