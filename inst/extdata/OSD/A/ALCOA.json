  "OVERVIEW": "The Alcoa series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in old alluvium and colluvium from reddish quartzose limestone, and calcareous sandstone and shale.  These soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep stream terraces and foot slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 50 to more than 90 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Base saturation in the Bt horizon ranges from about 8 to 25 percent.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid strongly acid except where limed.  Rock fragments are mostly gravels, pebbles, or cobbles of sandstone and shale and range from 0 to 15 in each horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10R or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Hue of 5YR is allowed if it occupies less than 50 percent of the colors in the upper 40 inches of the Bt.  Value of 4 or 5 is also allowed below the upper 40 inches.  Some pedons have brown or yellow mottles in the lower part.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam, clay, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam."

At a site about 15 miles from the type location, the average annual air temperature is 59.5 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 50 inches."
