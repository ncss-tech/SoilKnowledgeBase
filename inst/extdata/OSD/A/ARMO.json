  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 20 to 45 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 6 inches.  The solum is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline; however, a few pedons are neutral in the upper 6 inches.  Depth to weathered bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is loam or silt loam, but the range includes silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has the same color range as the B horizon.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly clay loam, and very gravelly loam.  Many pedons are irregularly stratified with coarse loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.  The sand and gravel is mostly chalk fragments which comprise 15 to 40 percent of the horizon below the B horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Java and Hayness soils in the same family and Nuckolls, Uly, and Wakeen soils.  Java soils formed in glacial till and the coarse fragments are quartzitic and granitic.  In addition, Java soils have a thinner solum.  The Hayness soils formed in red sandstone with hue ranges from 2.5YR to 7.5YR.  Nuckolls, Uly, and Wakeen soils are fine-silty.  In addition, Wakeen soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over chalky limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Armo soils are on uplands, and slope gradients range from 1 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in thick unconsolidated, calcareous, loamy sediments derived from chalky limestone modified by alluvial and eolian silty materials.  Some of the steeper slopes are below limestone ledges and above dark fissile, clayey shales.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 56 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 28 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 30 to 44."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bogue, Brownell, Heizer, Nibson, Roxbury, and Wakeen soils.  Bogue soils are clayey and moderately deep over shale, and are below areas of Armo soils. Brownell, Heizer, Nibson, and Wakeen soils are on positions above Armo soils.  Brownell, Heizer, and Nibson soils are underlain with chalky limestone or chalky shales.  Roxbury soils are on low stream terraces and have a thicker mollic epipedon."
