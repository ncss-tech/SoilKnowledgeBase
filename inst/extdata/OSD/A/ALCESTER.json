  "OVERVIEW": "The Alcester series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in silty colluvial-alluvial sediments on terraces, foot slopes and flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters (24 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
