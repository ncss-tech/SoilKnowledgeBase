  "OVERVIEW": "The Alsco series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in granite and gneiss alluvium.  Alsco soils are on high dissected alluvial fans near steep mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about l2 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 1/4 F.",
