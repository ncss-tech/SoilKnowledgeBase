Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in extremely cobbly and stony alluvium from granite and gneiss.  The climate is semiarid continental.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 1/4 to 68 1/4 F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from l0 to l4 inches.  The frost-free period is l80 to 220 days."
