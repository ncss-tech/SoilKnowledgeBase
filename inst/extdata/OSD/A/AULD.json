  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 40 to 60 inches.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches usually is moist in some parts from about December 1 until late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  During the dry period soil cracks 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches wide at the surface and about 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide at the bottom extend to or partly through the upper part of the C horizon.  Up to 10 percent of the soil volume is made up of rock fragments with most of the fragments near the surface and in the lower part of the soil material.  In most pedons, most of the soil material in the C horizon and in a few pedons in the soil in the lower part of the A horizon is calcareous and has few to many lime segregations.  Major soil cracks usually are closed all of the moist period and open all of the dry period.  Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is reddish brown or dark reddish brown with hue of 5YR and value of 3 or more dry.  The upper 10 to 30 inches of the A horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The upper part of the C horizon is reddish brown or yellow in hue of 5YR through 10YR."

Alo, Altamont, Ayar, and Cibo soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Alo and Cibo soils have a lithic contact less than 40 inches below the surface.  Bosanko soils have a chroma of less than 1.5 in the upper 20 to 30 inches of the profile.  Centerville soils have a paralithic contact less than 40 inches below the surface.  Porterville soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches.  (See Remarks).  Seville soils have a lime-silica hardpan at a depth of less than 40 inches."

The climate is one of long dry summers and short mild winters with average annual precipitation of 10 to 16 inches.  The average January temperature is 49 degrees F, average July temperature is 77 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 330 days."
