  "OVERVIEW": "The Arboles series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine textured slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on pediments. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
