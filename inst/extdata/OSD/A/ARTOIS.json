Moist hues are 2.5Y and 20YR values are 3 or 4 and texture ranges from gravelly loams to gravelly clay loams, structure from moderate coarse subangular blocky to structureless massive.  Consistence ranges from hard and friable to hard and firm; reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  The Bt horizon colors are in 2.5 and 10YR hues with values of 5 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist; chromas are 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Texture ranges from gravelly light clay to clay; structure from weak to moderate subangular blocky or massive; consistence from very hard to extremely hard, firm to very firm, sticky to very sticky, and plastic.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline."

The Dibble soils ave medium acid Bt horizons and the Ryer soils have medium acid A horizon and are well drained.  The Azule and Hopeton soils have grayish brown a horizons and dark grayish brown Bt horizons that are 15 inches thick.  The Marvin and Modesto have dark colored A and Bt horizons and the Plaza soils have a ca horizon in the lower Bt.  The Perkins soils have dark red neutral Bt horizons and the Rincon soils have medium and strongly acid A horizons and very dark grayish brown Bt horizons."
