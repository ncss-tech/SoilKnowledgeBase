  "OVERVIEW": "The Atencio series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from red sandstone and shale.  Atencio soils are on sloping alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils are usually leached to a depth of 10 to 17 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  This horizon is commonly sandy loam, but ranges to loam or gravelly loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is usually sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction and has 18 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent pebbles.\nThe IICca horizon has 20 to 40 percent cobbles and 35 to 50 percent pebbles.  Sand ranges from medium to coarse and from 25 to 40 percent by volume."
