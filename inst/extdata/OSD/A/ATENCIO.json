These soils are usually leached to a depth of 10 to 17 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  This horizon is commonly sandy loam, but ranges to loam or gravelly loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is usually sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction and has 18 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent pebbles.\nThe IICca horizon has 20 to 40 percent cobbles and 35 to 50 percent pebbles.  Sand ranges from medium to coarse and from 25 to 40 percent by volume."
