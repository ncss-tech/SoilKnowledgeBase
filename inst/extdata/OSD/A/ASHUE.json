The soil is neutral or mildly alkaline. These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick. The argillic horizon contains 35 to 90 percent coarse fragments and has 20 to 30 percent clay in the fine earth fraction. Depth to very gravelly sand exceeds 30 inches. The A1 or Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is loam or sandy clay loam and has more than 35 percent coarse fragments. It has weak or moderate blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe C and 2C horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2, 3 or 4. The C horizon is loam or sandy loam, and has 50 to 90 percent coarse fragments. The 2C horizon is extremely gravelly sand or extremely cobbly sand."
