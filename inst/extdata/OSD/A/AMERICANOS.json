The soil between a depth of 6 and 17 inches is dry in most years from mid-May to mid-October and moist in all parts from early December to early May.  Where present, depth to duripan ranges from 50 to 72 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the family control section is 18 to 27 percent and content of material coarser than very fine sand is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout the profile.\nThe Ap and A horizons have dry color of 10YR 5/4 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 3/4.  Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent.  Content of clay is 12 to 20 percent.  Some subhorizon above 8 inches has moist chroma of 4 or is massive and hard.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; or 7.5YR 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.
