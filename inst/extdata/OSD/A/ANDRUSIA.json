  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Andrusia series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  They formed in sandy and gravelly sediments on glacial outwash plains, glacial lake beaches, and glacial stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the subsoil and rapid in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The rock fragment content is typically 0 to 15 percent but ranges to 35 percent in the B and C horizons.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days in most years during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 5.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, or coarse sand.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Some pedons have subhorizons of sandy clay loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have Bk or BC horizons.  When present, the Bk horizon has coatings of secondary carbonates on the underside of the rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The fine earth fraction is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, gravelly sand, or gravelly coarse sand.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Braham, Cutaway, DeMontreville, Leaflake, Pomroy, and Redeye soils do not have sand or gravelly sand in the lower one-half of the series control section beneath the argillic horizon.  The Escanaba soils have Bs horizons 8 to 22 inches thick above the argillic horizon.
