Mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 51 degrees F. and mean summer temperature at 20 inches is 63 degrees to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5.5 through 7 dry, 3.5 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak thin platy or weak fine granular structure and is moderately or strongly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam to clay loam or silty clay loam and averages 28 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. It is moderately or strongly alkaline and contains some lime, mainly disseminated, but occasionally as veins."
