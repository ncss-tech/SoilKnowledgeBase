  "REVDATE": "08/2000",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Archuleta series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or loamy slope alluvium over residuum, derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Archuleta soils are on hills, ridges, canyons, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
