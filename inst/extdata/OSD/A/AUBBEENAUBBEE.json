  "OVERVIEW": "The Aubbeenaubbee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvium and the underlying loam till. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
