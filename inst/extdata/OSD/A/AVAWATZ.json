  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 53 to 59 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 12 and 35 inches becomes moist in some part from early December to May, is continuously moist for 90 to 120 days when the soil is above 47 degrees F. and is continuously dry the rest of the year.  Organic carbon ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 percent.\nThe A1 horizon is grayish brown, dark brown, or brown (10YR 5/2, 4/3, 5/3).  Moist colors are dark brown or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3, 3/2).  This horizon is sandy loam or loamy sand and averages 5 to 15 percent gravel.  It has weak to moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  Base saturation is assumed to be 75 to 100 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown, or light brownish gray (10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 6/2).  Moist colors are dark brown , dark yellowish brown or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/2).  This horizon has thin strata of sandy loam between depths of 20 to 40 inches and averages 5 to 15 percent fine gravel."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ledow series in the same family and the Danskin, Metz, Mottsville, Newruss and Shaffer series.  Ledow soils are usually moist and have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 53 degrees F.  Danskin soils have a regular decrease in organic matter with increasing depth, are underlain by bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches and have moist value of 4 or more in the A horizon.  Metz soils are thermic.  Mottsville and Shaffer soils have a mollic epipedon.  Newruss soils have a coarse, loamy control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils are subject to rare flooding in places.  They formed in alluvium from mixed but dominantly granitic sources.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches of which about 1/4 to 1/3 falls as snow of short duration.  The average January temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 72 to 74 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 55 to 57 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 160 to 190 days."
