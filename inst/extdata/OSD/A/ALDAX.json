  "OVERVIEW": "The Aldax series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite or basalt.  Aldax soils are on hills.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
