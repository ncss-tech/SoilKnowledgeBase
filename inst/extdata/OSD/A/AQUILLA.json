  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 70 to more than 90 inches.  The soil ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  The average content of clay, plus silt, plus very fine sand, ranges from 25 to 45 percent in the solum.  Silt content averages less than 10 percent.  There is a water table that ranges from 48 to 60 inches below the soil surface for several weeks during the wet season.\nThe A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma 2 to 6.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value 5 to 7, and chroma 4 to 8.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizons has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4.  Texture is fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  The Bt part is thin lamellae comprising from 10 to 30 percent of the horizon that are generally discontinuous and less than 1 inch thick.  Combined thickness of the lamellae is more than 6 inches within 80 inches of the surface.  The lamellae have color in hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value 5 to 7 and chroma 6 to 8.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Most pedons contain a few pockets and streaks of clean sand grains and some pedons have a few depletions in chroma of 2 in the lower part.\nThe 2Bt horizon has about the same colors as found in the lamellae of the E and Bt horizons.  Texture is mainly sandy clay loam but ranges to fine sandy loam with up to about 20 percent gravel.  The 2C horizon commonly contains 30 to 60 percent by volume of rounded quartz gravel."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Faula series in the same family and the Aline, Bienville, Eufaula, and Goltry series.  Faula soils do not have a perched water table between 48 and 60 inches at some time during the year.  Aline and Goltry soils occur in cooler and drier climates; in addition, Goltry soils have wetness depletions within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Bienville soils are moist for longer periods of time.  Eufaula soils have a lower percent of fines, do not have a seasonal water table within 60 inches of the surface and are in slightly cooler climates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aquilla soils are on Pleistocene age terraces.  The soils are nearly level to gently undulating.  Slopes are mainly 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in thick sandy sediments that have been reworked by wind.  At the type location, the average annual temperature is 67 degrees F., the average annual precipitation is 35 inches, and the Thornthwaite P-E index is about 56."
