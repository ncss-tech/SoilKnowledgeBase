The mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 63 degrees to 68 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  The depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is about 20 to 36 inches thick.  The sola are neutral or mildly alkaline and the C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam and averages 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe IIC horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam."

Anaverde soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments, have 20 to 40 percent mica, and a mean annual soil temperature of about 57 degrees F.  Calimus soils are usually dry, dominantly have loam B2 horizons and formed in lacustrine sediments.  Linville soils have silt loam or silty clay loam B2 horizons with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Nook soils have loam B2 horizons.  Sinamox soils are usually dry and have silt loam sola and gravelly IIC horizons.  Sweeney soils have mean annual soil temperature of about 59 degrees F.  Watama soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."

The soils formed in eolian material weathered mainly from basalt and andesite. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 degrees  to 51 degrees F. The average January temperature is 34 degrees F.
