    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Berks, Chiswell, Dyke, Frederick, Groseclose, Jefferson, Klinesville, Matneflat, and Shottower soils.  Berks and Klinesville soils are on narrow ridgetops and steep sideslopes over shale bedrock and contain less clay. Chiswell soils are on convex uplands and are shallower to bedrock. Dyke soils are on high terraces and do not have the dark colored surface. Frederick and Groseclose soils are on similar landscape positions and are more yellow than the Austinville soils.  Jefferson and Matneflat soils are on mountain footslopes and in upland drainageways from sandstone and contain less clay. Shottower soils have lighter colored surface layers and are on high stream terraces."
