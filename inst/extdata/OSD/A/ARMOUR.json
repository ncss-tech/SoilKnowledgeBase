  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. Depth to limestone bedrock is greater than 5 feet. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed. Fragments of gravel or chert range from 0 to 10 percent in the upper 40 inches. The fragments range up to about 3 inches in diameter. Below 40 inches the fragment content is dominantly 0 to 35 percent, but ranges to 60 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam except a few severely eroded areas are silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have few to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow or red. Texture of the fine earth is dominantly silt loam or silty clay loam but includes loam below 40 inches.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have the same colors and textures as the Bt horizon. Some pedons developed in limestone residuum below 48 inches and have 2Bt, 2BC or 2C horizons. These horizons have a hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray. Texture of the fine earth is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Barnsdale, Dexter, Dossman, Goodwill and Hicks series in the same family and the closely related Ashton, Elk, Sandhill and Stiversville series. Barnsdall and Dexter soils are free of fragments and have less clay and more sand in the lower part of the solum and C horizon. Dossman soils formed in thick deposits of loess on dissected uplands and have a lower sand content in the control section. Goodwill soils have more sand in the lower B horizon. Hicks soils developed in a loess mantle and residuum of interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale on upland ridgetops. Rippable bedrock is at 40 to 60 inches from the surface. Ashton soils are moderately acid to neutral and are mesic. Elk soils have a lighter colored surface layer and are mesic. Sandhill and Stiversville soils are fine-loamy and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches from the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Armour soils are on stream terraces, foot slopes, and valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in old alluvium, valley fill, or in alluvium and the underlying clayey residuum of limestone. Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 47 inches."

The Braxton, Hampshire, Inman, Maury, and Sengtown soils are on uplands and are clayey. The Byler and Tarklin soils are on stream terraces and have a fragipan. Humphreys soils are on foot slopes and stream terraces and are fine-loamy. Hawthorne soils are on uplands and are loamy-skeletal."
