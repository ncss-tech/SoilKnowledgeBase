  "OVERVIEW": "The Adelaide series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, with a mantle of loess high in volcanic ash. Adelaide soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
