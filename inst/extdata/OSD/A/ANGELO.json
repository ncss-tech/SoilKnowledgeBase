    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nEdited 11/2013 (RFG-THW): Converted to tabular format and added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 30 cm  (0 to 12 in) (Ap and A horizons)\nCambic horizon - 30 to 72 cm (12 to 28 in) (Bw horizon)\nCalcic horizon - 72 to 148 cm (28 to 58 in) (Bk1 horizon)\nShrink-swell features - high shrink-swell behavior above the calcic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab data available from NSSL is one pedon 3/82 from the type location in Tom Green County, Texas, Nos. 814669-814673, and one pedon 3/82 Irion County, Texas Nos. 814663-814668.  Also, one pedon 9/65 from Tom Green County, Texas, by Texas Tech No. S65TX-226-1, which is now considered to be outside the range of characteristic for the Angelo series as reclassified 10/82.  As a result of the 1982 NSSL data, the classification of the Angelo series is changed from fine, mixed, thermic Torrertic Calciustolls, to fine-silty, mixed, thermic Aridic Calciustolls for the correlation of the Irion County, Texas, soil survey.  The NSSL data shows the silicate clay fraction to be dominated by smectite, causing the A and B horizons above the calcic horizon to have high shrink swell properties with COLE of more than 0.07.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
