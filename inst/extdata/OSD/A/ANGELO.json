  "OVERVIEW": "The Angelo series consists of deep or very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium derived from limestone. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on treads of terraces on dissected plateau. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F)..",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nEdited 11/2013 (RFG-THW): Converted to tabular format and added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 30 cm  (0 to 12 in) (Ap and A horizons)\nCambic horizon - 30 to 72 cm (12 to 28 in) (Bw horizon)\nCalcic horizon - 72 to 148 cm (28 to 58 in) (Bk1 horizon)\nShrink-swell features - high shrink-swell behavior above the calcic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab data available from NSSL is one pedon 3/82 from the type location in Tom Green County, Texas, Nos. 814669-814673, and one pedon 3/82 Irion County, Texas Nos. 814663-814668.  Also, one pedon 9/65 from Tom Green County, Texas, by Texas Tech No. S65TX-226-1, which is now considered to be outside the range of characteristic for the Angelo series as reclassified 10/82.  As a result of the 1982 NSSL data, the classification of the Angelo series is changed from fine, mixed, thermic Torrertic Calciustolls, to fine-silty, mixed, thermic Aridic Calciustolls for the correlation of the Irion County, Texas, soil survey.  The NSSL data shows the silicate clay fraction to be dominated by smectite, causing the A and B horizons above the calcic horizon to have high shrink swell properties with COLE of more than 0.07.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
