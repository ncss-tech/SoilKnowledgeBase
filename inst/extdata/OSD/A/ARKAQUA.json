  "REVDATE": "07/2005",
  "STATES": "GA,NC,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arkaqua series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on nearly level flood plains along creeks and rivers in the Appalachian, Blue Ridge, and Great Smokey Mountains.  They formed in loamy alluvial sediments washed largely from soils formed in residuum from granite, gneiss, schist, phyllite, and other metamorphic and crystalline rocks.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 54 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 35 to 60 inches.  Depth to stratified sand and gravel is 44 to more than 72 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Flakes of mica range from few to many in all horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon that has hue of 10YR, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It has texture same as the A horizon.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 8, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam. Few to many, fine to coarse, faint to prominent yellowish red, strong brown, yellowish brown, brownish yellow, and dark yellowish brown mottles are throughout the horizon; light brownish gray or grayish brown mottles are within 24 inches of the surface.\nThe Bw2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam; it is rarely sandy loam.  Few to many fine to coarse, faint to prominent brownish, reddish, or grayish mottles are throughout the horizon.  The Bg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has few to many brownish, reddish, or grayish mottles.  Texture is same as Bw horizon.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is similar in color and texture to the Bw2 horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is very gravelly loamy sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, and clay loam.  The Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, or it is neutral, value 3 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 2.\nTexture is same as C horizon."

Codorus, Congaree, Suches and Suka soils are better drained.  Cartecay and Enoree soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Chewacla soils have mean annual soil temperature above 59 degrees F.  French soils have thinner sola.  Mantachie soils are siliceous.  Rowland soils have redder B horizons or underlying layers.  Tawcaw soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section."

Mean annual precipitation is about 50 to 70 inches and evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 50 to 58 degrees F.  In unprotected areas, these soils flood occasionally or frequently for very brief periods.  Protected areas are subject to rare or occasional flooding for very brief periods."
