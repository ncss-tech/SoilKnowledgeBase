  "OVERVIEW": "The Argirocker series consists of shallow to very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from limestone.  Argirocker soils are on backslopes on ridges and dipslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 533 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
