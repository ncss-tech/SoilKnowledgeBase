  "OVERVIEW": "The Ayette series consists of deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
