The mollic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick.  The soil moisture control section is moist in some or all parts throughout the year in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments by volume.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BE or EB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments by volume.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons may have an E, B/E or E/B horizon.  In cultivated areas the E horizon may be incorporated in to the Ap horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or their gravelly analogues with subhorizons of fine sandy loam, sandy loam or silt loam in some pedons.  It averages between 18 and 30 percent clay.  It has 1 to 25 percent rock fragments by volume.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have a thin BC or 2BC horizons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Almora soils have slightly concave or plane slopes on outwash plains, moraines, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 18 percent.  They  formed in a 24 to 40 inch thick loamy mantle derived from loamy outwash or a thin layer of till and underlying sandy or gravelly outwash sediments.  These sediments are Wisconsin age.   Mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches. Frost free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1200 to 1600 feet."
