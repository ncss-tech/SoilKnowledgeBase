  "OVERVIEW": "The Almora series consists of very deep, well drained,  soils formed in a loamy mantle and sandy or gravelly outwash sediments .  These soils are on till plains, moraines, stream terraces, and outwash plains.  They have moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

Slope gradients range from 0 to 18 percent.  They  formed in a 24 to 40 inch thick loamy mantle derived from loamy outwash or a thin layer of till and underlying sandy or gravelly outwash sediments.  These sediments are Wisconsin age.   Mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches. Frost free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1200 to 1600 feet."
