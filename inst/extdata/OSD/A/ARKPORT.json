  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 100 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 36 to more than 120 inches. Depth to the uppermost lamellae ranges from 9 to 30 inches. Very fine sand plus silt ranges from 30 to 80 percent, and fine sand and coarser is greater than 15 percent throughout the soil. Rock fragments are usually absent but can range up to 10 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or silt loam. It has weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular structure and is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral. Wooded or uncultivated areas have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is loamy fine sand, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. The horizon is massive or single grain or has very weak or weak, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky structure. It is loose to friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral. Some pedons have a Bw or E horizon in place of the BE horizon.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sand to loamy very fine sand. It is structureless or has weak or very weak granular or subangular blocky structure and is loose to very friable. The Bt part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam to loamy fine sand. It is massive or it has weak fine or medium blocky or platy structure, and is friable or firm. The E and Bt horizons range from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sand or loamy very fine sand. It is massive or single grain with loose to friable consistence. Some pedons have thin layers of coarse silt. It ranges from moderately acid through moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Amboy, Colonie and Galen soils are in similar families. Amboy soils contain more silt, and Colonie soils formed in coarser sandy deposits and contain less silt and clay than Arkport. Galen soils have redoximorphic concentrations in the upper part of the subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Arkport soils are nearly level to steep soils on the tops and sides of glacial deltas and glacio-fluvial sand plains, and on dunes and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soil formed in water-sorted deposits having a high content of fine and very fine sand. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 300 to 900 feet above sea level."

Amboy, Wallington, and Williamson soils formed in nearby coarse-silty lake deposits. Collamer, Dunkirk, and Niagara soils formed in fine-silty lake deposits. Colonie, Elnora, and Stafford soils formed in sandy deposits lower in silt and clay content than Arkport soils. Galen, Minoa, and Lamson soils are in a drainage sequence with Arkport soils and are in lower lying landscape positions. Howard and Palmyra soils are on nearby glacial outwash terraces that are gravelly."
