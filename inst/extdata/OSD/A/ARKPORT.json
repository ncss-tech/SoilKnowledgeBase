  "OVERVIEW": "The Arkport series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacio-fluvial deposits having a high content of fine and very fine sand. These soils have thin horizontal bands of loamy material in the subsoil. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high throughout the mineral soil. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and the mean precipitation is about 38 inches.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Amboy, Colonie and Galen soils are in similar families. Amboy soils contain more silt, and Colonie soils formed in coarser sandy deposits and contain less silt and clay than Arkport. Galen soils have redoximorphic concentrations in the upper part of the subsoil."

Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soil formed in water-sorted deposits having a high content of fine and very fine sand. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 200 days.

Amboy, Wallington, and Williamson soils formed in nearby coarse-silty lake deposits. Collamer, Dunkirk, and Niagara soils formed in fine-silty lake deposits. Colonie, Elnora, and Stafford soils formed in sandy deposits lower in silt and clay content than Arkport soils. Galen, Minoa, and Lamson soils are in a drainage sequence with Arkport soils and are in lower lying landscape positions. Howard and Palmyra soils are on nearby glacial outwash terraces that are gravelly."
