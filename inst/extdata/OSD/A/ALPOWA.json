  "STATES": "ID,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Alpowa series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and colluvium and slope alluvium from basalt on lower canyon walls, and loess and basaltic alluvium on alluvial fans, hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 49 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  The 10- and 40-inch control section averages less than 18 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Depth to carbonates is 12 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak granular or blocky structure and is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is very gravelly silt loam, very cobbly silt loam, very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam and is very gravelly or very cobbly to depths of 40 inches and ranges to very cobbly or very gravelly coarse sandy loam below 40 inches.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Slopes are 1 to 75 percent.  Alpowa soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and alluvium from basalt and loess.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The average July temperature is 69 to 72 degrees F.  The average January temperature is 29 to 32 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 135 to 180 days in Washington and northern Idaho and 100 to 135 days in Idaho."
