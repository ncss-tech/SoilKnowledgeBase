  "OVERVIEW": "The Ahwahnee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  These soils are footslopes and mountains.  Slope is 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about, 60 degrees F.",

The soil between depths of about 8 and 33 inches is usually moist but is dry in all parts from a h ut midDMay until late October.  Mean annual soil temperature varies from about 63 to 68 degrees F.  Base saturation by sum of cations averages between 50 to 75 percent throughout.  The soil is medium acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizons have dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 3/3, 5/2, 4/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.  The surface 4 to 6 inches averages 1 to 3 percent organic matter and is less than 1 percent at 8 inches.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  The lower boundary is clear or gradual or a transition horizon is present.\nThe Bt horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 and 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist colors are 1 or 2 units of value darker.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam with 14 to 18 percent total clay.  Increase in clay content from the A to Bt horizon is 3 to 5 percent.absolute.\nA C horizon may be present between the Bt and the paralithic contact. When present it is sandy loam."
