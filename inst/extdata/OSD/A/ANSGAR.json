  "STATES": "IA,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ansgar series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess and the underlying loamy glacial till or till-derived sediments.  These soils are on interfluves and head slopes of broad, shallow drainageways on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 848 millimeters.",
