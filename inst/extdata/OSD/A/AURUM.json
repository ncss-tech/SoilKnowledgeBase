  "OVERVIEW": "The Aurum series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in a mudflow deposit from welded tuff, limestone and quartzite. Aurum soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
