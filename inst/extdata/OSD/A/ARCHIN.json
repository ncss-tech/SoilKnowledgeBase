  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to soft bedrock typically is below 60 inches.  Some pedons have buried horizons at depths below 30 inches.  Visible salts are between depths of 16 and 24 inches.  The SAR ranges from 13 to 20 in the natric horizon.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  The combined A and E horizon thickness ranges from 5 to 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7, 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sand loam, loam, silt loam, or loamy fine sand and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam or sandy clay loam, but is clay loam in some pedons.  It typically has 20 to 26 percent clay and ranges from 18 to 34 percent clay.  It ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have accumulations of carbonate and salts in the lower part of the Btn horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loam but some pedons are sandy clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.  It has few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate and fine accumulations of salts.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam but is stratified with finer or coarser textured material in some pedons.  Crystals of gypsum and other salts and accumulations of carbonate, if present, typically are in the upper part but are in all parts in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly to very strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bullock, Parchin, Rominell, Tismid and Tisworth series.  Bullock and Parchin soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, Bullock soils are less than 5 inches to the base of the E horizon.  Rominell soils are more alkaline in the E and Bt horizons and have carbonates in the upper Bt horizon.  Tismid soils do not have an E horizon and are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the Btn horizon.  Tisworth soils have carbonates in the Bt horizon and are strongly and very strongly alkaline in the Btn horizon."

Assinniboine, Chinook, Eapa, Kremlin, and Yamac soils are on higher smoother parts of the landscape. Assinniboine, Eapa, Chinook, Kremlin, and Yamac soils do not have a natric horizon."
