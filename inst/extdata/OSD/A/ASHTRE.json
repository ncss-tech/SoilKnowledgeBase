  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashtre series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks.  Ashtre soils are on plateaus and ash flows.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks of pyroclastic origin.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,475 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Westbutte soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have thick Mollic epipedons, and do not have argillic horizons."
