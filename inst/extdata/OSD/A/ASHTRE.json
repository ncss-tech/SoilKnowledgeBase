  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ashtre soils are on plateaus and ash flows.  They typically occur on north-facing shoulder and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks of pyroclastic origin.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,475 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Tusune soils are ashy-skeletal, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and have a cryic temperature regime.  Westbutte soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have thick Mollic epipedons, and do not have argillic horizons."
