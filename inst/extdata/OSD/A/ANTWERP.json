  "OVERVIEW": "The Antwerp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and sedimentary plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
