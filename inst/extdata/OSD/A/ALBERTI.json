  "OVERVIEW": "The Alberti series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed mainly from basic igneous rocks.  Alberti soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The depth to weathered bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard rock is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. from about February 1 to December 15 (300 to 330 days) and is greater than 47 degrees F from about March 1 to December 1 (250 to 290 days).  The soils are dry from about June 10 to November 15 (140 to 160 days).  The soil is moist in some or all parts for 90 or more days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.  The reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Rock fragments are 15 to 35 percent of the soil and mostly gravel or cobbles with up to 5 percent stones. In dry soil, cracks are 1 to 5 mm wide from the surface to 25 cm or more. A few pressure faces were observed but intersecting slickensides were absent..\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 2.5YR 4/6, 3/6, 3/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4. Moist colors are 2.5YR 3/6, 3/4; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4. Textures are cobbly clay loam, gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam. Organic matter is 0.5 to 1 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry colors of 2.5YR 3/3, 3/4, 3/6, 4/4, 4/6; 10R 4/4. Moist colors are 2.5YR 3/4, 2.5/4, 3/6; 10R 3/4. Textures are cobbly clay, cobbly clay loam or gravelly clay."
