    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in similar families are the Dupo, Eel, Killbuck, Orion, Wallkill, and Washtenaw series. Dupo soils have silty textures over contrasting fine-textured material. Eel soils lack the buried dark-colored A horizon within a depth of 91 cm (36 inches). Killbuck and Washtenaw soils have chroma of 2 or less and redox features in the upper 50 cm (20 inches). Orion soils are coarse-silty. Wallkill soils have a buried Histosol within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 inches) of recent light colored alluvium overlying a buried Aquoll. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F)."

Of these, only the poorly drained Killbuck soils have recent alluvium over a buried soil. Eldean, Ockley, Sleeth, Thackery, Lippincott, and Westland soils formed in outwash and are on nearby low terraces. Nearby soils formed in till include the series which are members of the Miamian and Morley drainage sequences."
