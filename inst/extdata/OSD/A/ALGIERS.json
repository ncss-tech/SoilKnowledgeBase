  "OVERVIEW": "The Algiers series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 inches) of recent light colored alluvium overlying a buried dark colored soil. These soils are on flood plains or low terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in similar families are the Dupo, Eel, Killbuck, Orion, Wallkill, and Washtenaw series. Dupo soils have silty textures over contrasting fine-textured material. Eel soils lack the buried dark-colored A horizon within a depth of 91 cm (36 inches). Killbuck and Washtenaw soils have chroma of 2 or less and redox features in the upper 50 cm (20 inches). Orion soils are coarse-silty. Wallkill soils have a buried Histosol within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."
