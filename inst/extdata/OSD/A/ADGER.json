The Dogtooth soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Exline soils are somewhat poorly drained, have chroma of 1 in the surface, and are mottled above a depth of 40 inches.  The Ferney soils are moderately well drained, are mottled at depths above 40 inches, and do not have horizons with accumulations of gypsum.  The Mekinock soils are moderately well drained and moderately deep over shale bedrock.  Rhoades soils are deep and have a paralithic contact between the depths of 40 and 60 inches."

These soils formed in clayey alluvium derived mainly from shale.  The climate is cool with long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 125 days."
