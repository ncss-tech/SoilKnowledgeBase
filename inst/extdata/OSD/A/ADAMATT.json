The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered andesitic rock.  Harder, unweathered bedrock is typically within 76 to 102 cm of the soil surface.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 12 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly 5 to 76 mm diameter gravel and cobbles.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as andesite or andesitic tuff.\nA horizon\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nOrganic matter content: 2 or 3 percent.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nVolcanic glass content: 40 to 70 percent in coarse silt through fine sand fractions.\nBt horizons\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist.\nChroma: Commonly 3 dry or moist, but may be 2 dry or moist in upper part.\nTexture: Very gravelly ashy sandy loam, very cobbly ashy sandy loam, or very gravelly ashy loam.\nClay content: 12 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nVolcanic glass content: 30 to 50 percent in very fine sand and fine sand fractions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Adamatt soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite or tuff-breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,000 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
