    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 49 degrees to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock are 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section contains more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. It is dominantly silt loam and is modified by 3 to 50 percent basalt gravel in the horizon immediately above the bedrock; however, the weighted average content of coarse fragments for the particle-size control section is 1 to 25 percent. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick. The hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It has 0 to 25 percent basalt pebbles and has weak granular or subangular blocky structure. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe BA horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. Basalt pebbles range from 0 to 25 percent.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky or prismatic structure. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It has weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly silt loam.  Basalt pebbles range from 3 to 50 percent. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe R layer is basalt and contains secondary carbonates in fractures of the bedrock in some pedons."
