  "OVERVIEW": "The Alda series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained, soils that formed in 20 to 40 inches of stratified loamy alluvium over coarse sand or gravelly sand on flood plains.  These soils are moderately deep over coarse sand or gravelly sand and have slope ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (51 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 64 centimeters (25 inches).",

AC horizons may not be present in all soil profiles.\nOSD Modifications:\n(9/5/2003 PRF) made minor gramatical edits and updated the competing series.\n(5/2002 RRZ)  Recommend that taxonomy be changed from COARSE-LOAMY, MIXED SUPERACTIVE, MESIC FLUVAQUENTIC HAPLUSTOLLS to COARSE-LOAMY, MIXED SUPERACTIVE, MESIC OXYAQUIC HAPLUSTOLLS;\nWater depth changed to 1.5 to 4.5 ft.; Natural Drainage Class changed from somewhat poorly drained to somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained; solum thickness increased to 71 centimeters (28 inches);, A saline phase of the Alda Series is recognized with EC.2 to 8 mmhos/cm.\nChanged permeability to Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity 9/05.
