AC horizons may not be present in all soil profiles.\nOSD Modifications:\n(9/5/2003 PRF) made minor gramatical edits and updated the competing series.\n(5/2002 RRZ)  Recommend that taxonomy be changed from COARSE-LOAMY, MIXED SUPERACTIVE, MESIC FLUVAQUENTIC HAPLUSTOLLS to COARSE-LOAMY, MIXED SUPERACTIVE, MESIC OXYAQUIC HAPLUSTOLLS;\nWater depth changed to 1.5 to 4.5 ft.; Natural Drainage Class changed from somewhat poorly drained to somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained; solum thickness increased to 71 centimeters (28 inches);, A saline phase of the Alda Series is recognized with EC.2 to 8 mmhos/cm.\nChanged permeability to Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity 9/05.
