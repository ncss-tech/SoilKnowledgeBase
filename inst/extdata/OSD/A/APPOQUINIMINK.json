These soils become extremely acid when drained or removed from the marsh.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ag horizon)\nAquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously saturated (endosaturation)\nHigh n value--the zone from the surface to 32 inches has n value greater than 0.7, typically greater than 1.0, material flows easily between the fingers when squeezed.\nSulfidic materials--incubated samples, to a depth of 80 inches, show a drop in pH of 0.5 or more units to a pH value of 4.0 or less within 8 weeks\nSapric soil materials--the zone from 32 to 43 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume\nHemic soil materials--the zone from 43 to 80 inches has a a fiber content after rubbing that is one-sixth to two-fifths of the soil volume\nSERIES INTERPRETATION RECORD(s): DE0014\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name     Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nDE0014 APPOQUINIMINK  0-1    55-58  175-200    36-55    0-2\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nDE0014 FREQ            0-  0  APPARENT JAN-DEC   >99\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nDE0014  0- 6  MK-SIL SIL SICL         0-  0 100-100 15-30 250-580\nDE0014  6-32  SIL SICL MK-SIL         0-  0 100-100 15-35 100-420\nDE0014 32-80  MUCK MPT                0-  0    -      -    70-140\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
