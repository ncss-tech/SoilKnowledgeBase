These soils become extremely acid when drained or removed from the marsh.\nCarbon stock and carbon density ranges are not primary criteria for defining this series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include--\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 centimeters (Aseg horizon)\nAquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)\nHigh n-value--the zone from the surface to 81 centimeters (Aseg, Cseg1, and Cseg2 horizons) is moderately fluid to highly fluid.\nSulfidic materials--incubated samples, to a depth of 200 centimeters, show a drop in pH of 0.5 or more units to a pH value of 4.0 or less within 8 weeks\nSapric soil materials--the zone from 81 to 109 centimeters (Oase horizon) has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume\nHemic soil materials--the zone from 109 to 200 centimeters (Oese horizon) has a fiber content after rubbing that is one-sixth to two-fifths of the soil volume\nSERIES INTERPRETATION RECORD(s): DE0014"
