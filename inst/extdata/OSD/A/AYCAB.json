Shook soils have a lithic contact at 76 to 127 cm and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Skyway soils have a lithic contact within 100 cm and have textures of fine sandy loam or loam in their particle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aycab soils are on concave mountain side slopes, on predominantly north aspects.  These soils formed in residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,800 to 3,100 meters.  The climate is cold, continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 510 mm that comes largely from winter snowfall.  Mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free season is less than 70 days."
