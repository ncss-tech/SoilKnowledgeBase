  "OVERVIEW": "The Aycab series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Aycab soils are on predominantly north-facing mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
