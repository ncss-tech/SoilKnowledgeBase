    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 to 54 degrees F.  The soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F from March 25 through November 30.  The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is usually dry in all parts from July 10 until October 15 and is moist in some or all parts from December 22 to April 22.  The soil is effervescent throughout, with the greatest accumulation in the lower B horizon.  Depth to a water table or mottles is more than 30 inches.\nThe A horizon is gray or grayish brown in the upper 10 inches and light gray, gray,light brownish gray, or grayish brown in the lower part, in 10YR hue.  It is loam, silt loam, or dark grayish brown, very dark gray, very dark brown, or black, in 10YR hue.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and has platy or subangular blocky structure or is massive and slightly hard.  Electrical conductivity is highest in the A horizon with 2 to 8 mmhos/cm.\nThe B horizon is brown grayish brown, dark grayish brown, gray, or dark gray, in 10YR hue.  Moist colors are brown and dark gray to black 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/3, 2/2, 2/1.  The B horizon is heavy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay and averages 35 to45 percent clay in the upper 20 inches.  It has moderate or strong prismatic structure parting to angular blocky structure, and is massive in the lower part.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline and is assumed to have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in some part.  In some pedons a Blt horizon is present or the B3t horizon is absent.\nThe C horizon is pale brown, light brownish gray, grayish brown, or brown dry and dark brown, very dark grayish brown, or very dark brown moist in 10YR or 2.5YR hue.  It is stratified and is loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or loam and has up to about 20 percent durinodes.  Cementation and the durinodes occur at depth of about 40 to 50 inches."

Calneva, Couch, Rumbo, and Standish soils have ochric epipedons and aridic moisture regimes.  McKay soils have fine-silty control sections and are noneffervescent in the A horizon.  Trenton soils have mixed mineralogy and 7.5 YR hue in the B2t horizon and 5YR hue in the C horizon.  Wahtum soils have clayey over loamy control sections and have durinodes or weakly cemented horizons above depth of 40 inches."

They formed in stratified sediments from basic igneous and pyroclastic rocks.  The climate is cool semiarid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 15 inches.  Snowfall is 20 to 49 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F; average July temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F, mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 80 to 130 days."

Buntingville soils have fine-loamy B2t and have duripans at depths of less than 20 inches.  Pit soils are clayey throughout, with many slickensides."
