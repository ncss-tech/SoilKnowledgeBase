  "COMPETING SERIES": {

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Alford soils are commonly on summits, shoulders and backslopes of loess hills, and less commonly on broad swells of outwash plains. Alford soils formed in 203 to more than 366 cm (80 to more than 144 inches) of loess and commonly overlie other landforms. In places, this soil formed completely in loess of the Peorian interglacial stage. In other places the upper part of the soil formed in Peorian loess, and the lower part formed in a loess member that has a sand content higher than the Peorian and is known locally as \"gritty loess\". The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches), frost-free period ranges from 150 to 210 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 311 meters (340 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hosmer, Iona, Iva, Muren, and Sylvan soils. The moderately well drained Hosmer, Iona and Muren soils are on summits and shoulders of loess hills. The well drained Sylvan soils are calcareous within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and typically are on backslopes of loess hills. The somewhat poorly drained Iva soils are typically on nearly level areas between loess hills."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) in the subsoil. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2.0 inches per hour)."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most nearly level to sloping areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, wheat, and legume-grass mixtures for hay and pasture. Steeper areas are used for permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is forest. Maple, yellow-poplar, oak, and hickory are the dominant species."
