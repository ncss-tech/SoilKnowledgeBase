  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The texture is very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly analogs of very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or sandy loam. Gravel content ranges from 20 to 65 percent, cobble content ranges from 5 to 40 percent, and stones range from 0 to 20 percent. The control section averages between 35 and 90 percent rock fragments by volume. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are none.  The Canaan and Killington soils may compete when they are updated to include CEC activity class.  Both of these soils occur in areas with greater than 35 inches of mean annual precipitation.  Closely related soils are the Michigamme and Peshekee series. Michigamme and Peshekee soils average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  In addition, the Michigamme soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arcadian soils are on rocky knolls and ridges, moraines, till plains, and post glacial lake shorelines underlain by bedrock. They formed in gravelly or cobbly loamy material overlying igneous, metamorphic or conglomerate bedrock. Slopes range from 1 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 35 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dishno, Gratiot, Michigamme, Montreal, Nipissing, Paavola, and Sabattis soils. The moderately deep Michigamme and Nipissing soils are in similar landscape positions as the Arcadian soils. The deep Dishno soils and very deep Paavola and Montreal soils are moderately well drained soils on till plains and moraines. The very deep, somewhat poorly drained Gratiot and poorly drained Sabattis soils are in depressions and drainageways. Rock outcrops are commonly associated with the Arcadian soil."
