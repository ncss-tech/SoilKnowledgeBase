  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Anamac series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, argillite or fine grained igneous rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces or hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
