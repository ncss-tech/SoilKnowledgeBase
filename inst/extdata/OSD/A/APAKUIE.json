Keekee soils have a mollic epipedon and are calcareous in the control section.  Kilohana soils have a mollic epipedon and textures coarser than very fine sandy loam in the upper part of the control section."

The soils formed in volcanic ash, pumice and sand underlain by unweathered cinders and `a`a lava.  Outcrops of `a`a lava are common.  The mean annual rainfall is 20 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F., average January temperature 47 degrees F., and average July temperature is 55 degrees F."
