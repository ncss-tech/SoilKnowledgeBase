  "OVERVIEW": "The Apakuie series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash, pumice and sand.  Apakuie soils are on uplands and have slopes of 12 to 20 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
