  "OVERVIEW": "The Arrowrock series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent in foothills and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
