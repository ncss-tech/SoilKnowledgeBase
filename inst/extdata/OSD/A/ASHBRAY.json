  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashbray series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from granite.  These soils are on mountains, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
