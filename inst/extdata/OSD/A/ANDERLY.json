  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soil is usually moist but is dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the 4-month period following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 56 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry.  It is silt loam and has 10 to 17 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has weak to moderate subangular blocky or prismatic structure."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in loess mixed with a small amount of volcanic ash overlying basalt.  The climate is semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean winter temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 64 to 66 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F.  Precipitation is 11 to 14 inches.  The frost-free season is 150 to 170 days."

Nansene soils are on steep north slopes and are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Wrentham soils are on steep north slopes and are loamy-skeletal."
