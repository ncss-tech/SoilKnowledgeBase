Alcova and Elk Hollow soils are deep and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the C horizon.  Almy, Fleutsch, Forelle, Rock River, Stunner and Wolford soils lack a lithic contact within depth of 40 inches.  Bluerim, Cushool, Diamondville, Rawah and Satanka soils have a paralithic contact.  Bonfri soils have hue of 10YR in the B2t horizon and are neutral in the Ap horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Antonito soils are on gently sloping basalt flows.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in loess and residuum weathered from basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with peak periods in July, August, and September.  The average annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,000 feet.  Frost-free season is 90 to 115 days."
