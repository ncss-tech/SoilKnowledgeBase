Structure is granular or crumb.  Consistency is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.   Structure is moderate medium subangular blocky or medium prismatic.  Consistency is hard or very hard.

Alcova and Elk Hollow soils are deep and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the C horizon.  Almy, Fleutsch, Forelle, Rock River, Stunner and Wolford soils lack a lithic contact within depth of 40 inches.  Bluerim, Cushool, Diamondville, Rawah and Satanka soils have a paralithic contact.  Bonfri soils have hue of 10YR in the B2t horizon and are neutral in the Ap horizon."

The average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with peak periods in July, August, and September.  The average annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,000 feet.  Frost-free season is 90 to 115 days."
