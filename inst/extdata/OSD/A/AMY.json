  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Amy soils occur on level to nearly level Pleistocene terraces of the Western and Southern Coastal Plains.  These soils formed in old alluvium high in silt.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 61 to 66 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 48 to 54 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include:  Gurdon, Guyton, Ouachita, Sacul, Sardis, Savannah, and Smithdale soils.  Gurdon soils, which occur on slightly higher positions on similar landscapes have a coarse-silty control section and are somewhat poorly drained.  Guyton soils, which occur on lower flood plains, have higher base saturation.  Ouachita soils, which occur on natural levees, do not have an argillic horizon and are well drained.  Sacul soils, which occur on adjacent uplands, have a red, clayey control section and are moderately well drained.  Sardis soils, which occur on similar landscape positions, do not have an argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained.  Savannah soils, which are on adjacent uplands, have a fragipan and are moderately well drained.  Smithdale soils, which occur on adjacent uplands, have a red, fine-loamy control section and are well drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; and slow permeability.  Some areas of these soils commonly flood a few times each year, usually during winter and early spring.  A seasonally high water table is within 12 inches of the soil surface from December through April, most years."
