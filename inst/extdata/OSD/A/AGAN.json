  "OVERVIEW": "The Agan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from granite.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on smooth or slightly convex uplands.  Most areas are in the Grand Prairies (MLRA 85).  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 39 inches, and mean annual temperature is 63 degrees.",

These horizons are clay, silty clay, or gravelly clay and ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Granitic fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4, or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2, or it has redoximorphic concentrations and depletions in shades of gray, brown, or yellow.  It is gravelly clay, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Granitic fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 15 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe BC horizon has the colors of the Bt3 horizon.  In some pedons it has redoximorphic concentrations and depletions in shades of pink, gray, brown, or yellow in hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, or it is mottled in these colors.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly counterparts of clay, clay loam, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam, and ranges from slightly to moderately alkaline.  Granitic fragments range from 40 to 90 percent by volume.  About 35 to 75 percent by volume of these fragments are less than 3 inches in diameter, and about 5 to 15 percent by volume are 3 to 10 inches in diameter."
