The soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a flows that are 1,500 to 5,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 70 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to 3,810 millimeters (60 to 150 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1,270 meters (25 to 50 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges from 16 to 20 degrees C (61 to 68 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
