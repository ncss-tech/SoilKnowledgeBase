  "OVERVIEW": "The Avintaquin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from limestone.  Depth to hard limestone is 50 to 100 cm.  Avintaquin soils are on mountain slopes and dip slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",

Fragments are limestone.\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 74 cm.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 74 cm.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 18 cm.  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 18 to 74 cm.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nLithic contact:  Limestone at 74 cm.  (R horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.  The upper 18cm of the soil after mixing is non-calcareous, which defaults the classification to Haplustolls, rather than Calciustolls.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014."
