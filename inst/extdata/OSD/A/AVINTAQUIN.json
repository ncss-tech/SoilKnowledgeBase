Fragments are limestone.\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 74 cm.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 74 cm.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 18 cm.  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 18 to 74 cm.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nLithic contact:  Limestone at 74 cm.  (R horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.  The upper 18cm of the soil after mixing is non-calcareous, which defaults the classification to Haplustolls, rather than Calciustolls.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
