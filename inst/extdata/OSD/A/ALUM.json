Angular fragments of sandstone or ironstone pebbles and stones comprise 0 to 15 percent of any horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The E horizon is 1 or 2 units of value higher in color than the A horizon.  Texture of the A and E horizons are loamy fine sand or fine sand, and combined are 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many, fine to medium, and faint to distinct in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  Texture is sandy clay or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay content.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.  The lower Bt horizon has colors similar to the upper Bt horizons.   is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or loam that is interbedded with thin discontinuous strata of sandstone."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Demona, Heatly, Leming, Nimrod, and Poth series.  Demona, Leming, and Nimrod soils have low iron depletions due to wetness and, in addition, Leming soils have mean average soil temperatures more than 72 degrees F., and Nimrod soils, as well as Heatly soils, have less than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Poth soils have dominant colors in the Bt horizon in a hue of 10YR, and are neutral or alkaline in reaction."

The soil formed in loamy sediments with interbedded strata of sandstone and ironstone that are typified by the Queen City formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 34 inches.  Thornthwaite's annual P-E index ranges from 35 to 44.  The mean annual temperature is about 68 to 70 degrees F."
