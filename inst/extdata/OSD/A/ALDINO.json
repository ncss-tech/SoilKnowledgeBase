  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 48 inches.  Depth to fragipan ranges from about 17 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  Coarse fragment content, mostly angular quartzite pebbles, ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the upper part of the solum and 0 to 15 percent inthe IIB and IIC horizons.  Some pedons have up to 3 percent of the surface covered by stones.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in the solum and from strongly acid to neutral in the 2C horizons.  Hues range from 10YR through 5Y in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E and Ap horizon generally have value of 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon is silt loam or silt in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE and the Bt horizons have value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is mottled in the lower part.  The Bx horizon has value of 4 through 6, chroma of 2 through 4 in the upper part, and 1 through 4 in the lower part, and are mottled.  The B horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has a wide range in color.  Some are variegated, streaked, or banded but lack low chroma mottles.  It is loam or silt loam with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ava, Boston, Cincinnati, Grantsburg, Hildebrecht, Hosmer, Lawrenceville, Mercer, Nicholson, Omulga, Otwell, Rainsboro, Weisburg and Zanesville series in the same family.  Ava soils have a B and A horizon immediately above the Bx horizon.  Boston, Nicholson, and Weisburg soils are clay or silty clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Cincinnati, Hosmer, and Rainsboro soils have sola more than 48 inches thick.  Grantsburg soils lack a litho- logic discontinuity.  Hildebrecht soils have chert fragments in the lower part of the solum.  Lawrenceville soils have coarse fragments dominated by shale, siltstone, or sandstone or sand fraction from these materials.  Mercer soils either lack a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section or are silty clay or clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Omulga soils have water worn gravel in the B and C horizons.  Otwell soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section.  Zanesville soils have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR in the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nCaptina, Dulac, Loring, Providence and Sadler series are in closely related families.  Captina soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Dulac, Loring, and Providence soils have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 59 degrees F.  Sadler soils have an E1 hori- zon."
