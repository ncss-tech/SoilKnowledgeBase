(Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise noted. All textures are \"apparent field textures\". pH measured using a 1:1 soil to water mixture. When described on October 22, 2004, the soil was moist from 0 to 21 cm (0 to 8 inches) and wet from 21 to 23 cm (8 to 9 inches).\nOa--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); black (10YR 2/1) muck, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable, slightly hard, non sticky and slightly plastic: common very fine and fine roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; non-smeary; very strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

These soils are in depressions of constructional landscapes consisting of pahoehoe flows that are 750 to 5,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1000 to 3000 millimeters (40 to 118 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1016 to 1270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 17 degrees C. (50 to 62 degrees F.).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)."
