    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 inches). Thickness of the colluvial sediments ranges from 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 inches). Depth to carbonates ranges from 61 to 122 cm (24 to 48 inches), but can be as deep as 152 cm (60 inches) in some pedons. The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches) in thickness. It includes the upper part of the Bg horizon in some pedons. The particle-size control section averages between 35 and 42 percent clay. Rock fragment content is less than 15 percent throughout the series control section.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon rather than a BA horizon.\nThe BA, Bg, 2Bg, or 2BCg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or is neutral; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 or less or may have a chroma of 3 in pedons with hue of 5Y. Redoximorphic features commonly are present with chroma of 2 to 8. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon commonly has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or is neutral, but includes 10YR in some pedons; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 8. It is silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

Milford soils have subhorizons (thin strata or varves) in the lower part of the series control section that have poorly graded soil separates. Secondcreek soils are greater than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of soil development. Woldale soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ashkum soils are on nearly level and gently sloping till plains of Wisconsinan Age in colluvial positions on the low parts of the topography and along upland drainageways. The soils formed in colluvial sediments consisting of erosional sediments from till and loess or shallow lacustrine materials less than 40 inches (102 cm) thick and in the underlying silty clay loam till. Slope gradients commonly are less than 1 percent and range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (47 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1030 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 165 to 311 meters (540 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."
