  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashkum series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on till plains. They formed in colluvial sediments and in the underlying silty clay loam till. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
