  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 degrees to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 69 degrees to 72 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 90 days in all parts of the moisture control section during the summer months.\nDepth to water table under drained conditions ranges from 60 to 80 inches. Depth to mottles ranges mainly from 20 to 40 inches. Mottles occur in some pedons above 20 inches.  There is very little or no evidence of reduction or segregation of iron. The soils are saturated with water during some period of the year at depths of 40 to 60 inches unless artificially drained.\nOrganic matter content decreases irregularly. Lime content ranges from 15 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is moderately or strongly calcareous and moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe 10 to 40 inch section has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It generally ranges from very fine sandy loam to heavy silt loam, but averages less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Thin lenses of loamy fine sand occur above 40 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Anco, Green River, Penoyer, and Placeritos series. Anco soils are dominantly silty clay loam in the control section with 28 to 35 percent clay. Green River soils have a control section that is dominantly sandy loam with more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Penoyer soils do not have distinct mottles above a depth of 40 inches and are usually dry.  Placeritos soils have more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Abraham soils are on nearly level to level alluvial flood plains and low lake terraces at elevations of 4,500 to 4,700 feet. They formed in alluvium from sandstone, limestone, volcanic rock, and shale. The climate is arid. Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 52 degrees F., mean summer temperature ranges from 70 degrees to 73 degrees F. Average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 8 inches.  Frost-free period is 115 to 120 days."
