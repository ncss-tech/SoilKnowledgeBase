  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to horizons of continuous calcium carbonate accumulations is 6 to 20 inches.  Depth to layers with ESP greater than 15 is more than 7 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 0 to 15 percent and is mostly gravel.  These soils are usually dry, but are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section in April, May, and early June in most years. The moisture control section is dry for more than 60 consecutive days during the 90 day period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. The soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or warmer for 175 to 195 days.  Organic carbon in upper 40 cm. of the profile is .6 to .8 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; 10YR hue has value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3; 2.5Y and 5Y hues have value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  Textures are sandy loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; 10YR hue has value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam or clay loam.  Reaction is typically neutral through moderately alkaline but is slightly acid in some pedons.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 7.5YR; 10YR and 2.5Y hues have value of 4 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4; 7.5YR hue has chroma 3 or 4; Textures are silty clay, clay, clay loam or silty clay loam with clay ranging from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 50 percent, and sand from 10 to 45 percent. Exchangeable sodium is 3 to 12 percent. It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Btkn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 in 10YR hue and 2 to 4 in 2.5Y hue. Textures are the same as for the Bt horizon.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline. Exchangeable sodium is greater than 15 percent.  Salinity is 4 to 15 mmhos/cm.\nThe Bkn or Bkny horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 in 10YR hue and 2 to 4 in 2.5Y and 5Y.  Textures are the same as for the Bt and Btkn horizons.  Exchangeable sodium is 10 to 30 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 6 to 15 percent.  Salinity ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos/cm.  Reaction is moderately through very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has the same range in texture, reaction, and color as the Bkn horizon.  Exchangeable sodium is 10 to 30 percent."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from alkaline shale.  Some areas have an eolian influence on the surface layer. Elevation is 3500 to 5500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with more than half falling in April, May and June.  The frost-free period is 105 to 130 days."
