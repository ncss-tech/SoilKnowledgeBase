  "OVERVIEW": "The Atchison series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in eolian deposits from the Ogallala Formation on fan remnants and valley sides on River Valleys in the Central High Tablelands (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent. Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 46 centimeters (18 inches).",
