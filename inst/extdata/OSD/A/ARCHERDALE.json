  "OVERVIEW": "The Archerdale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from mixed rock sources.  Archerdale soils are on low fan terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from June to October unless irrigated, and moist in all parts from December thru April.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay.  Segregated or secondary lime occurs at depths greater than 50 inches in some pedons.  In some areas adjacent to streams or sloughs there is an overwash of very fine sandy loam 12 up to 20 inches thick.  The overwash is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3; or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  This horizon has 1.5 to 4.0 percent organic matter.  It is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; or 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; or 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4.
