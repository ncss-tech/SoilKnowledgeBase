  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick.   The mean annual soil temperature is 62 or 63 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from June to October unless irrigated, and moist in all parts from December thru April.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay.  Segregated or secondary lime occurs at depths greater than 50 inches in some pedons.  In some areas adjacent to streams or sloughs there is an overwash of very fine sandy loam 12 up to 20 inches thick.  The overwash is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3; or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  This horizon has 1.5 to 4.0 percent organic matter.  It is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; or 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; or 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam or clay."

Elevations are 40 to 150 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog commonly occurs in the winter months.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  The mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 260 to 280 days."
