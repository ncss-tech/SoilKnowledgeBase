  "OVERVIEW": "The Aberdeen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial lacustrine sediments on lake plains.  Permeability is slow in the solum and moderate to slow in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Depth to accumulated salts is typically greater than 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist.  It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam but is loam, fine sandy loam, or silty clay in some pedons.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BE horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has gray or light gray silt coatings on faces of peds.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have E or B/E horizons.  Some pedons have relic columnar peds that are deeply degraded both in color and in structure, with horizontal and vertical streaks of gray or light gray extending an inch or more into the columns.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay that contains an estimated 35 to 55 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Btk or Btkn horizons.\nThe Bkyz horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or silt loam. It is slightly to strongly alkaline.  It has more exchangeable magnesium plus sodium than calcium plus hydrogen and exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent in the Bkz or C horizons.  The Bkz and upper part of the C horizons have few or common fine nests and threads of gypsum and other salts.  Some pedons do not have accumulations of gypsum and/or other salts.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and typically is laminated with very thin strata of very fine sand to clay.  Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness.  It is slightly to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have sandy materials below a depth of 40 inches.  Other pedons have loamy glacial till below a depth of 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Aberdeen soils are on level and nearly level lake plains. Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. The soils formed in laminated glaciolacustrine sediments of silt sized particles but with thin lens of very fine sand or clay sized particles. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees, and mean precipitation from 17 to 24 inches. Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer. Growing season is about 120 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation is 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Beotia, Great Bend, Harmony, and Zell soils do not have a natric horizon and are on the slightly higher plane to convex surfaces. In addition, Beotia and Great Bend soils are fine-silty and Zell soils are coarse-silty. Bearden and Fargo soils do not have a natric horizon are lower on the landscape. In addition, Bearden has a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches. Fargo soils are poorly drained. Exline soils have visible salts within a depth of 16 inches and are in slightly lower parts of the landscape. Harmony soils lack natric horizons. Nahon soils have columnar structure in the Btn horizon. Harmony and Nahon soils are on the broad smooth flats in close association with the Aberdeen soils."
