  "OVERVIEW": "The Acadiana series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium of late Pleistocene age.  These very gently sloping to gently sloping soils are on side slopes of erosional stream channels on uplands.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 3 percent, but range to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",
