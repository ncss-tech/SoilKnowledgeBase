  "OVERVIEW": "The Ausmus series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash.  Ausmus soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.",
