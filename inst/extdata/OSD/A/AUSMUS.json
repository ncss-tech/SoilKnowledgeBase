  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ausmus soils are on drainageways and depressions on low lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,219 to 1,372 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
