  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Aerie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy glaciolacustrine deposits and in the underlying clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on convex surfaces on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
