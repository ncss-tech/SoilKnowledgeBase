  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Attella soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from dolostone and calcareous shale with additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,500 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Kram and Puffer soils have mesic soil temperature regimes.  Xine soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts, have mollic epipedons, and have calcic horizons."
