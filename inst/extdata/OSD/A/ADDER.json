  "OVERVIEW": "The Adder series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in herbaceous organic material 16 to 51 inches thick overlying siliceous sandy alluvium on backswamps of flood plains.  Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material and rapid or very rapid in the sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic layers and depth to the sandy substratum ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  The organic fibers are derived primarily from herbaceous plants, but some layers contain as much as 25 percent woody fibers.  Volume of wood fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the organic layers and from moderately acid to neutral in the sandy substratum.   Redox concentrations are in the C horizon in some pedons.\nThe surface tier has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or it is neutral in hue. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, or are neutral in hue. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  They are dominantly muck (sapric material) but layers of mucky peat (hemic material) totaling less than 10 inches in thickness are in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  In many pedons, the color is that of uncoated sand grains.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, or fine sand. A few thin strata of finer texture are in some pedons.  Coarse fragments typically are absent in the C horizon but the volume of sandstone channers or chert gravel ranges up to 5 percent in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Adrian, Dawson, Dawsil, Houghton, Markey, and Tawas series.  Adrian, Dawson, Markey, and Tawas soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition Dawson Markey, and Tawas soils are frigid and Dawson soils are dysic.  Dawsil soils are frigid and dysic.  Houghton soils have more than 51 inches of organic material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Adder soils are on backswamps of flood plains.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in 16 to 51 inches of herbaceous organic deposits over siliceous sand.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Houghton and Newlang soils.  Houghton soils formed in organic deposits more than 51 inches thick.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Newlang soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Adder soils where the organic mantle is thin or absent."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Surface runoff is very slow or ponded.  Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material and rapid or very rapid in the sandy deposits.  These soils are subject to frequent flooding of long duration.  The main period of flooding is from October to June but flooding can occur following any period of high runoff.  These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at depths from 1 foot above to 1 foot below the surface much of the time from October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are in native marsh vegetation which includes sedges, reeds, grasses, and shrubs such as willow, alder, quaking aspen, and dogwood.  Some areas have been drained and are used for cropland or pastureland.  Common crops include corn, vegetable crops, and mint."
