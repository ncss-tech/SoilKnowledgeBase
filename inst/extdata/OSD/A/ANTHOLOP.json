  "OVERVIEW": "The Antholop series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian volcanic ash over residuum weathered from basalt.  Antholop soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
