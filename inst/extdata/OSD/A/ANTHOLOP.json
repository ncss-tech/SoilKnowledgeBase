Esmod soils have neutral or slightly alkaline reaction in the Bt horizons.  Fulstone soils lack rock fragments in the duripan and have a neutral Bt horizon.  Grassycan soils have bedrock at depths of 18 to 36 cm.  Kunaton soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Puls soils have moderately acid to neutral Bt horizons and have bedrock within 100 cm.  Ridenbaugh soils have an E horizon and calcium carbonate accumulations above the duripan.  Rogerson soils have an E horizon, a neutral Bt horizon, and a duripan less than 25 cm thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Antholop soils are on basalt-capped plateaus.  These soils formed in eolian volcanic ash over residuum weathered from basalt.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,230 to 2,290 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
