It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2, commonly with few to many masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  It is clay, sandy clay, silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.

Bayboro, Bethera, Bladen, and Coxville soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Cherokee and Meggett soils have an abrupt texture change between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon.  Grifton and Yonges soils are fine-loamy."
