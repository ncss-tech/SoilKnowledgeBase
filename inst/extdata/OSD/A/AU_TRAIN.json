The depth to the weathered sandstone ranges from 25 to 51 centimeters and the depth to the lithic contact ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Rock fragments are dominantly sandstone but include some igneous and metamorphic fragments. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid. Volume of ortstein ranges from 0 to 30 percent in the Bhs horizon.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 1.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is coarse sand, sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. They are coarse sand, sand or loamy sand.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR; value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3."

They formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying Cambrian sandstone (Munising formation). Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 840mm and mean annual temperature is about 4 to 6 degrees C. Elevation ranges from 195 to 259 meters."

Deerton soils are excessively drained and are on knolls, ridges and shoulders of steeper side slopes. Trout Bay soils are very poorly drained, Gongeau soils are poorly drained and Jeske soils are somewhat poorly drained. These soils are in depressions and drainageways and on toe and foot slopes of seepy side slopes."

These soils have representative depth to wet soil moisture status that ranges from 30 to 46 centimeters below the surface in February, March, April, May, September, October, November and December. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high above the bedrock, moderately high in the Cr horizon, and very low in the bedrock."
