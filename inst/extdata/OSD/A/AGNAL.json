    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Most years the entire profile is saturated from September to April by a water table and stagnant surface water. The soil temperature reflects the water temperature when inundated. The soil temperature is warmer than 47 degrees F from February 15 to December 1. The texture control section ranges from 35 to 58 percent clay content. The salt content ranges from 2.0 to 7.5 percent in the upper 31 inches of the salic horizon. The electrical conductivity ranges from 13 to 100 decisiemens per meter in the upper 31 inches. The sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 18 to 300. The organic matter ranges from 0.9 to 5 percent in the upper 9 inches and decreases regularly with depth.\nSome pedons do not have the Azn1 horizon which is a thin layer of deposition caused by repeated ponding. The lower A horizon is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 4/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3 or 5/1. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 3/3; 5Y 3/1 or 3/2. Texture is clay loam, clay or silty clay. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe upper B horizon is 10YR 3/1, 4/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/4, 6/2 or 6/3.

Texture is clay loam, clay or silty clay. It is noneffervescent to strongly effervescent. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. When gypsum crystals are present, this horizon is designated as Bnyz. Rounded masses of manganese are present in some pedons.\nThe lower B horizon is 10YR 2/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 5Y 4/2 or 4/3.

Rounded masses of manganese are present in some pedons."

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 60 to 150 feet. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 61 to 63 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches. Frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

The pH was determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators. Textures determined by modified Bouyoucos method. Electrical conductivity determined by solubridge and the saturation extract. Sodium adsorption ratio determined by versenate method. Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black Digestion Method.\nSeries reclassified 5/95. It classified as fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Cumulic Haplaquolls when established.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon S87CA-019-014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
