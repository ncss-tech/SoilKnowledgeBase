  "OVERVIEW": "The Amana series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).",
