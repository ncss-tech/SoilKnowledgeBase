  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are permanently submerged. All horizons have a pH 1:1 water of neutral through moderately alkaline and an oxidized pH of ultra acid through moderately alkaline. One or more horizons within 50 cm of the soil surface have an oxidized pH of 4.0 or less. Soil has a 5:1 salinity greater than 0.2 dS/m throughout the profile.\nThe Ase, ACse, or CAse horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 10Y or is neutral, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is typically sandy loam through coarse sand. Silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam textures may be found to a lesser extent. Consistence is nonfluid through very fluid. It has 0.1 through 3.2 percent organic carbon. Herbaceous fibers are 0 through 5 percent unrubbed and 0 percent rubbed. Gravel content is 0 through 50 percent. Shell fragment content is 0 through 20 percent. Sulfurous odor may be present.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 10Y, 5GY or is neutral, value of 2 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6. Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand. Thin horizons of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam material may also be present. Consistence is nonfluid or slightly fluid. Gravel content is 0 through 55 percent. Shell fragment content is 0 through 50 percent. Redoximorphic features may be present."

Billington, Wequetequock, and Pishagqua soils are in mainland coves and lagoon bottom landscapes and have fluid silt loam materials in the soil profile. Fort Neck soils have fluid silt loam materials at the soil surface. Massapog soils are found on flood tidal delta flats in coastal lagoons and do not have sulfidic materials within 100 cm of the soil surface. Nagunt soils form on washover fan flats and washover fan slopes of coastal lagoons. Napatree soils are adjacent to landscapes dominated by till material in mainland coves and mainland submerged beaches, and have a particle-size class family of coarse-loamy. Rhodesfolly soils are found on washover fan flats in open bays."

In addition fishing is commonplace and the species found in the area are smelt, small cod, flounder, scup, menhaden, and white perch. Some areas are vegetated with native macroalgae, eelgrass (Zostera marina), and widgeon grass (Rupia maritima). Vegetative cover typically ranges from 0 to 35 percent."

Peraquic feature - Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 113 cm of salt water).\n2. Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Part of the ACse, 2C1, and part of the 2C2 horizon).\n3. Sulfidic materials - within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface (the Ase and ACse horizons).\n4. Lithologic discontinuity - contrasting soil materials at 40 cm (2C1 horizon).\n5. N-value > 0.7 - the zone from 0 to 40 cm (Ase and ACse horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Type location taken from 2005CT011001-LNB in Little Narragansett Bay.
