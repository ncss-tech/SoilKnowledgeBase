    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inch depth is about 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 68 degrees to 71 degrees F. The soils are usually moist during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months when not irrigated. They are moist for 60 to 90 continuous days during the winter.\nThe mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Combined thickness of the A and Bw horizons is 12 to 24 inches. Depth to the Bk (calcic) horizon is 12 to 28 inches. Individual layers of the control section range from fine sandy loam to very fine sandy loam or to loamy fine sand, but the control section averages sandy loam or fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is mildly to moderately alkaline and slightly to moderately calcareous. It is 7 to 16 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam to sandy loam. It is slightly to moderately alkaline and slightly to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is fine sandy loam to loamy sand. It is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is about the same as the Bk horizon except that it is mainly loamy fine sand to loamy coarse sand below about 35 inches."

Blackett, Blue Star, Eccles and Palisade soils are usually dry in all parts of the moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. Blue Star, and Layton soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 7 inches. Fielding and Welby soils have less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand; also Fielding soils have more than 18 percent clay. Kidman soils are noncalcareous to depths of 20 inches or more. Martini and Layton soils lack calcic horizons and Layton soils have loamy fine sand control section. Palisade and Eccles soils have ochric epipedons."

Parent materials are mixed lake sediments and alluvium dominantly from quartzite, limestone and sandstone. The climate is moist subhumid with moist, cold winters and hot, dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches. The mean annual temperature is 47 degrees to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 140 days."
