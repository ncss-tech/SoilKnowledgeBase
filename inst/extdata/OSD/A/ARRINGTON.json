    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to greater than 50 inches in thickness.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and from 0 to 15 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have a few faint mottles in shades of brown.  The texture is commonly silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 4.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles range from none to common in shades of brown or gray.  Texture is dominantly silt loam or silty clay loam, but the range includes loam, clay loam, and clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Redport and Verdigris series in the same family and the closely related Cannon, Egam, Huntington, Lynnville, and Staser series.  Redport soils have hue of 5YR or redder and are commonly calcareous.  Verdigris soils are in a region with a mean annual precipitation range of 35 to 47 inches and are probably dry for longer periods during most years.  Cannon soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments in each horizon.  Egam soils average more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Huntington soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick and are mesic.  Lynnville soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick and have mottles of chroma 2 or less immediately below the mollic epipedon.  Staser soils are fine-loamy."

Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range up to 8 percent percent on escarpments and along drainageways near major streams.  Arrington soils formed in recent alluvium.  Mean annual rainfall is 55 inches and mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. near the type location."
