    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Gray mottles due to wetness are within 30 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is a silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon and the E part of the B/E horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BE or BA horizon.  It has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. Mottles in shades of gray, yellow, or red range from few to many.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon and the Bt horizon have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 8 or they are mottled in shades of brown, gray and red.  They are silt loam or silty clay loam.  Mottles in shades of gray range from few to many.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is dominantly silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam but some pedons have subhorizons in the lower part that are silty clay. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid  in the Btg1 horizon and from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the Btg2 horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Glenmora, Keithville, and Kolin series in the same family and the Beauregard, Evangeline, Falkner, Freestone, Muskogee, and Porum soils in related families.  The Glenmora soils have a argillic horizon above the B/E horizon.  Keithville, Kolin, and Falkner soils have clayey 2B horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Beauregard soils have B horizons with less than 35 percent base saturation and more than 5 percent plinthite.  Evangeline and Muskogee soils have 15 to 25 percent weatherable minerals.  Freestone soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Porum soils have fine control sections."
