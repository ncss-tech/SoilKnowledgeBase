They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BE or BA horizon.  It has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. Mottles in shades of gray, yellow, or red range from few to many.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon and the Bt horizon have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 8 or they are mottled in shades of brown, gray and red.

The Glenmora soils have a argillic horizon above the B/E horizon.  Keithville, Kolin, and Falkner soils have clayey 2B horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Beauregard soils have B horizons with less than 35 percent base saturation and more than 5 percent plinthite.  Evangeline and Muskogee soils have 15 to 25 percent weatherable minerals.  Freestone soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Porum soils have fine control sections."
