  "OVERVIEW": "The Aradaran series consists of very deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in colluvium and alluvium from welded tuff and granitic rocks. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
