  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Agudo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in moderately fine textured calcareous alluvium derived from siltstone, shale and sandstone. These soils are on alluvial fan terraces, valley side slopes and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 356 mm (14 in), and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F).",
