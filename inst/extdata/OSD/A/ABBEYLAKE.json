It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Some pedons may be sandy loam or coarse sandy loam but are less than 7 inches thick.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sand or coarse sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Cantlin and Friendship soils have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the series control section.  Claire soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for 35 to 45 consecutive days for 120 days following the summer solstice. Corliss and Mahtomedi soils have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Feldtman, Menahga and Nymore soils do not have free calcium carbonate in the series control section.  Grayling, Omega, Sartell, Serden and Shawano soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the series control section.  Plainbo soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Sunday soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth."

They formed in sandy glacial outwash sediments.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 130.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."
