  "OVERVIEW": "The Abbeylake series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy glacial outwash on outwash plains, valley trains, and moraines.  These soils have rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

The series control section averages more than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Some pedons may be sandy loam or coarse sandy loam but are less than 7 inches thick.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sand or coarse sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Cantlin and Friendship soils have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the series control section.  Claire soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for 35 to 45 consecutive days for 120 days following the summer solstice. Corliss and Mahtomedi soils have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Feldtman, Menahga and Nymore soils do not have free calcium carbonate in the series control section.  Grayling, Omega, Sartell, Serden and Shawano soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the series control section.  Plainbo soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Sunday soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth."
