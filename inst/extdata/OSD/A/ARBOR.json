  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arbor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 45 to 75 centimeters of loamy local alluvium and in the underlying firm glacial till.  These soils are on slightly concave to linear foot slopes adjacent to dissected uplands.  Slope ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
