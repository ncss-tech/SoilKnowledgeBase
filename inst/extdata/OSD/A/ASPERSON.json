(Bt horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches.  (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 26 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with shale at 26 inches.  (2Cr layer)\nA paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Typic Cryoboralfs to Ustic Haplocryalfs.  Format and horizonation designations were updated. The series has not been updated by the state since 1972.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
