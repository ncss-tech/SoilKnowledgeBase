  "OVERVIEW": "The Antonchico series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from schist.  Antonchico soils are on beveled summits of hills and knolls.  Slopes are 3 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
