The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Enmedio soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental, do not have mollic epipedons or calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of hills. Setonville soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental, do not have mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent footslopes of hill and knolls."
