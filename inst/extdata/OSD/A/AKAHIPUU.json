These soils are on all hillslope positions of undulating to hilly `a`a lava flows that are 3,000 to 10,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 380 to 760 millimeters (15 to 30 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from January through July. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1520 to 1780 millimeters (60 to 70 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 17 to 21 degrees C (63 to 70 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
