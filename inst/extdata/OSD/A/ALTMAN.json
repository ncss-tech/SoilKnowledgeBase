    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 15 to 35 inches. (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 15 inches. (Ap, A, AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 15 to 41 inches. (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nCryic temperature regime.\nThis series has a transition to the argillic horizon that is marginal to the Abruptic subgroup. This distinction was not identified where this soil was first mapped; a more gradual clay increase to the argillic was chosen as most typical but future work must confirm this. Smectitic mineralogy is assumed.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
