Updated pedon description, Range in Characteristics, and other sections.\nADDITIONAL DATA: LSU characterization data on pedon S87LA053002-2 (NASIS pedon P89LA0530001). The Acadia series was previously classified in mixed mineralogy family. Reclassification was based on laboratory data including mineralogy data from typifying pedon (sample no. 81-85) by Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. Lab data were also run by NSSL on pedon S90LA-011-016 but this pedon is a taxadjunct to the Acadia series.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
