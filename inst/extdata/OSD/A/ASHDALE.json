All of the series except Elmont and Ripon do not have clay or silty clay 2Bt horizons nor sola terminated by bedrock. Elmont series have less than 55 percent clay in the lower sola and have a paralithic contact with silty shale at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches).  Ripon series have thinner sola and are underlain by limestone bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ashdale soils are on nearly level and gently sloping ridgetops and strongly sloping to moderately steep convex slopes in dissected upland areas. Slope gradients commonly are 3 to 12 percent and range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in 91 to 127 cm (36 to 50 inches) of loess and in a thin layer of residuum weathered from limestone bedrock. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 71 to 102 cm (28 to 40 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 130 to 170 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dodgeville, Nasset, Palsgrove, Ogle, Osco, and Tama soils. Dodgeville soils are in a contrasting particle size family and are underlain by limestone bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).  Dodgeville soils are on steeper side slopes in areas where Ashdale soils are on ridgetops.  Ogle soils have limestone bedrock at depths greater than 203 cm (80 inches), glacial till at depths of 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches), and are on similar landscape positions as the ashdale soils. Osco and Tama soils have limestone bedrock at depths greater than 203 cm (80 inches) , less clay in the lower subsoil and underlying material, and are on ridgetops in areas where Ashdale soils are on side slopes. Ashdale soils are in a biosequence with Nasset soils (Mollic Hapludalfs) and Palsgrove soils (Typic Hapludalfs)."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second)  in the loess and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the clayey residuum.  Permeability is moderate in the loess and slow in the clayey residuum. Surface runoff potential is medium to high as related to slope."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the lesser sloping areas are cropped to corn, hay, legume-grass pasture, or small grains. Steeper slopes are mainly used for pasture. Native vegetation is probably tall prairie grasses, chiefly bluestem."
