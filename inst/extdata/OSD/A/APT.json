  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features included in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to 18 inches (A , AB , and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - from 11 to 66 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and BCt horizons) with 0.9 percent organic carbon in the upper part.\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 31 inches.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nRevision 9/03, represents a relocation of the type location. The original series type location for the Apt series was established in the initial soil survey of the Alsea Area, Oregon (published 1973). The modal concept was represented with a clay surface texture. Adjacent survey areas using the Apt series recognized a silty clay loam surface texture as the representative pedon. Over 55,000 acres of the Apt series have been mapped with a silty clay loam surface texture, while only about 5,000 acres were recognized as having a clay surface texture (all of those acres were in the outdated Alsea Area, Oregon survey). With the recent update mapping of Benton County, Oregon Soil Survey the typical pedon for this soil was relocated based on further field observations and documentation to reflect a modal concept which has a silty clay loam surface texture and an isotic mineralogy class. The classification was changed to Fine, isotic, mesic Typic Haplohumults based on changes in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 8th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
