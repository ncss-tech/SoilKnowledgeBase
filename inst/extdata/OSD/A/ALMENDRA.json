Aqueda soils formed in alluvium from calcareous sedimentary rocks and are strongly effervescent throughout.  Anaheim soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact of sandstone or shale.  Carranza soils are deep, have 25 to 35 percent clay in the PSCS, have formed from sedimentary sources, and have extremely gravelly sandy clay loam C horizon within 40 inches, (102 cm).  Conejo soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the PSCS, have lime between 30 to 72 inches, (76 to 183 cm) and have greater than 27 percent clay in the surface.  Gazos soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact of sandstone.  Reward soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches, (102 to 152 cm).  Salinas soils are deep, formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale, have disseminated lime at a depth of 22 to 36 inches, (56 to 91 cm), and have chroma less than 1 throughout the upper 22 inches, (56 cm).  Westfan soils have Btk and Ck horizons that are strongly effervescent and have disseminated carbonates or concretions, have solum thickness of 25 to 60 inches, (63 to 152 cm) and have a water table between 36 and 60 inches, (91 to 152 cm) from November through April."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped as Vina loam, Farwell loam and Conejo loam in the Soil Survey of Chico Area, California 1926.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - zone from 0 to 40 inches, (0 to 102 cm) (Ap1, Ap2, Bw1, Bw2)\nCambic horizon - zone from 40 to 86 inches, (102 to 218 cm) (Bw3, Bw4, Bw5)\nParticle-size control section - zone from 10 to 40 inches, (25 to 102 cm) (Ap2, Bw1, Bw2).\nThe soil moisture control section - zone from 6 to 18 inches, (15 to 46 cm).\nThis series is established to split the concept of the Conejo series by PSCS clay, following current interpretative and taxonomic criteria.  Almendra will have loam surface texture, 18 to 27 percent clay in the PSCS and occurs on alluvial fans only.  The concept of this soil is that it has formed following the fining upwards sequence typical of local alluvial fan development, i.e. clay content is greatest at the surface and either has no decrease, or decreases with depth.  Coarser textures are found in the lower part of the profile.  Gravel typically underlies this soil.  However, it is normally below the normal depth of observation.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data from lab pedon number: 95P0513 NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
