  "OVERVIEW": "The Appian series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine deposits.  Appian soils are on lake plains, alluvial flats, and basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
