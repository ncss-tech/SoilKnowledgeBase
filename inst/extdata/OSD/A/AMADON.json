Limestone cobbles and channers range from 0 to 20 percent by volume and commonly are on the surface and mixed throughout the profile.  Limestone gravel content ranges from 0 to 14 percent throughout the profile.  Clay content ranges from 2 to 12 percent.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or is neutral with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam or the gravelly, cobbly or channery analogues of these textures.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These is the Freda series.  Closely related are the Creasey, Hogback, Lyman, Monson, and Peshekee series.  The Freda soils have a paralithic contact and formed over siltstone or shale bedrock.  The Peshekee soils have semiactive clay mineralogy and are underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock.  The Creasey, Hogback, Lyman and Monson soils have isotic mineralogy.  In addition, the Creasey soils have rock fragments derived from sandstone.  Hogback soils contain rock fragments derived from schist, gneiss, phyllite or granite and have Bhs horizons greater than 4 inches thick.  Lyman soils have coarse fragments derived from schist and phyllite.  Monson soils have yellower hues in the lower part of the profile and have coarse fragments derived from slate , phyllite or schist."

The Battydoe, Guardlake and Shelter soils lack bedrock within 60 inches.  Longrie soils are underlain by limestone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Furlong soils are sandy and are underlain by limestone bedrock.at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Ensign soils are somewhat poorly drained and are located in slightly lower landscape positions."
