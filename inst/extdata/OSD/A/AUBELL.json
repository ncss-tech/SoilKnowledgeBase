  "OVERVIEW": "The Aubell series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Aubell soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1780 millimeters (70 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
