  "OVERVIEW": "The Abbie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to moderately steep soils occur on stream terraces and stream terrace remnants emplaced over calcareous Ogallala sediments in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 530 mm (21 in).",
