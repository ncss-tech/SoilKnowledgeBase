    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are the following:\nOchric epipedon\nAlbic horizon - 2 to 14 inches (E horizon)\nGlossic horizon - 14 to 37 inches (E/Bt1, E/Bt2, and Bt/E subhorizons)\nArgillic horizon - 14 to 62 inches (E/Bt1, E/Bt2, Bt/E, 2Bt1, and 2Bt2 subhorizons)\nOxyaquic feature - apparent water table is at its highest depth between the months of November through April and is present for 120 to 180 cumulative days.\nPSCS - 14 to 34 inches (E/Bt1, E/Bt2, and Bt/E subhorizons)\nThe soils formed in relic proglacial lake deposits in a wetter environment.  The presence of the albic materials and redox features in the upper most horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.  Based on the color combinations in the glossic horizon some pedons will classify as aquic subgroup and are considered taxadjuncts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
