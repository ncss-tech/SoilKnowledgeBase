  "OVERVIEW": "The Afley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in till from basalt and in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic and igneous rock.  Afley soils are on mesa summits, alpine mountain slopes, and alpine basins.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F.",
