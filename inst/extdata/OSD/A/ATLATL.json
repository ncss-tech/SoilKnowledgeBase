    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atlatl soils are on knolls and rims of plateaus and mesas, and on dipslopes of cuestas. They formed in eolian material, alluvium, and residuum derived from calcareous Cretaceous sandstone and siltstone. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 7,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Wetherill soils are very deep, fine-silty, and occur on summits of plateaus and dipslopes of cuestas which are mantled with eolian deposits."
