  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist and are dry less than 45 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. The mean winter soil temperature is 43 to 50 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. Depth to basalt bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Hue is 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR. The umbric epipedon, when present, is 10 to 20 inches thick but some pedons have an ochric epipedon with moist chromas of 4 above 10 inches. The solum has a moist bulk density is 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 90 to 100 percent and over 2 meq. of aluminum per 100 grams of soil.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. It has 55 to 70 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and apparent clay content of 10 to 20 percent. It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter. The A2 horizon, when present, has color and organic matter content similar to the A1 horizon and has 30 to 55 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles and apparent clay content of 15 to 20 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It is medial loam or medial silt loam with 30 to 60 percent gravel, 10 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. Apparent clay content is 12 to 27 percent. It has 1 to 10 percent organic matter with less than 7 percent below 20 inches."

The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 170 inches.
