  "REVDATE": "08/2009",
  "STATES": "NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Atchee series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium and colluvium from weathered sandstone and shale. Atchee soils are on mesas, cuestas, breaks, hills, ridges, and structural benches and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",
