  "OVERVIEW": "The Ahpah series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist and sandstone. Ahpah soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist and sandstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C 50 to 55 degrees F).

Coppercreek soils are more than 150 centimeters deep to a lithic contact. Lackscreek soils are skeletal and 50 to 100 centimeters deep to a lithic contact. Tectah soils have an argillic horizon, fine particle-size class, and are more than 150 centimeters deep to a paralithic contact. Coppercreek soils occur on straight slopes below the Ahpah soils on sloping spur ridges. Tectah soils occur on ridge shoulders below the Ahpah soils on ridge crests. The Lackscreek soils are on narrow ridges and on locally steeper, or more strongly convex slopes."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 22 to 70 centimeters (Bw1 & Bw2 horizons)\n3. Paralithic contact - the bedrock interface at 87 centimeters\n4. Dystrudepts feature - base saturation of less than 60 percent, by ammonium acetate, in the zone from 25 to 75 centimeters\n5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 30 to 87 centimeters, averages 25 percent clay, by weight, and 26 percent gravel, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.53.\nThe assignment of the active activity class is inferred from lab data from the Lackscreek soils. Soil profile samples 82-RNP-10 and 83-RNP-14.\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNASIS User Pedon ID 84CA605REDW0003."
