  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ahpah soils occur on rounded main and spur ridges and convex slopes on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 19 to 926 meters (60 to 3035 feet). The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist and sandstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C 50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 220 to 290 days."

Coppercreek soils are more than 150 centimeters deep to a lithic contact. Lackscreek soils are skeletal and 50 to 100 centimeters deep to a lithic contact. Tectah soils have an argillic horizon, fine particle-size class, and are more than 150 centimeters deep to a paralithic contact. Coppercreek soils occur on straight slopes below the Ahpah soils on sloping spur ridges. Tectah soils occur on ridge shoulders below the Ahpah soils on ridge crests. The Lackscreek soils are on narrow ridges and on locally steeper, or more strongly convex slopes."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 22 to 70 centimeters (Bw1 & Bw2 horizons)\n3. Paralithic contact - the bedrock interface at 87 centimeters\n4. Dystrudepts feature - base saturation of less than 60 percent, by ammonium acetate, in the zone from 25 to 75 centimeters\n5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 30 to 87 centimeters, averages 25 percent clay, by weight, and 26 percent gravel, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.53.\nThe assignment of the active activity class is inferred from lab data from the Lackscreek soils.
