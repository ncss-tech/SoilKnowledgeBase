  "OVERVIEW": "The Awitava series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thin reworked eolian material over old alluvium derived from igneous rocks.  Awitava soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 3 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

(Bk1, and part of the Bk2 horizons)\nThe Bk2 horizon has 85 percent cemented material with troweled and laminar surfaces.  The material is not continuous enough to qualify as a petrocalcic horizon.\nSurface layers are influenced by eolian material.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
