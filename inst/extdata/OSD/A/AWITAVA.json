(A1, A2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 4 to 80 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and BCk horizons)\nSeries control section: The zone from 0 to 79 inches.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk1, and part of the Bk2 horizons)\nThe Bk2 horizon has 85 percent cemented material with troweled and laminar surfaces.  The material is not continuous enough to qualify as a petrocalcic horizon.\nSurface layers are influenced by eolian material.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
