Captom soils are dry for more than 35 consecutive days in the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Demontreville soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder and have argillic horizons averaging less than 18 percent clay.  Escanaba soils have Bs horizons and have argillic horizons averaging less than 18 percent clay.  Pomroy and Redeye soils have  bulk density values greater than 1.8 gm/cc in the lower third of the series control section."
