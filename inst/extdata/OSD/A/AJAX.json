  "OVERVIEW": "The Ajax series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in fine textured alluvium.  Ajax soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
