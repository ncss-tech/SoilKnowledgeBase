Elevations are 3,700 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Cowbone soils are poorly drained, have a calcic horizon and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Smout soils are moderately well drained and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Tohobit soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a calcic horizon and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Zeegee soils are poorly drained and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections."
