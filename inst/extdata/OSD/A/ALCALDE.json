  "BYREV": "Rev. MWR-LWH",
  "REVDATE": "12/2003",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Alcalde series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in fine textured alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Alcalde soils are on valley floors and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.",
