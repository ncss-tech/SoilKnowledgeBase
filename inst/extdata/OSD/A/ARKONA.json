  "OVERVIEW": "The Arkona series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying clayey till or lacustrine deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, or ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",
