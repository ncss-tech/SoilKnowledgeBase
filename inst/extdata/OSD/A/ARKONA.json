  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arkona soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, or ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. They formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying clayey till or lacustrine materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F)."

The poorly drained or very poorly drained Sickles series is in a drainage sequence with the somewhat poorly drained Arkona series. The Ithaca, Lenawee, and Pert soils are in areas where the clayey material is at the surface."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and low in the clay material. Permeability of the sandy upper solum is rapid while the clayey lower portion is very slow."
