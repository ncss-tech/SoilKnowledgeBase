  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ansping soils are on lower mountain side slopes and footslopes; and erosional remnants of fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from limestone, but also from some other sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,985 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
