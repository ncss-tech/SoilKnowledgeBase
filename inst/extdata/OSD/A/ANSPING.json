  "OVERVIEW": "The Ansping series consists of well drained soils that are deep to a strongly cemented duripan.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from limestone, but also from other sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  Ansping soils are on lower mountain side slopes and erosional fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
