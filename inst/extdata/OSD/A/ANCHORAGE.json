Texture is dominantly silt loam or very fine sandy loam but ranges to include sandy loam or sand.\nThe Bs horizons have moist hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma of 3, 4, 5, or 6.  Texture is dominantly very fine sandy loam but ranges to include fine sandy loam and very fine sand.\nThe 2BC horizon has moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; moist chroma of 3 or 4.
