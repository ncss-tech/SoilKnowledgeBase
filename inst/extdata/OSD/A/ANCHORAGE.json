  "OVERVIEW": "The Anchorage series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in wind-modified sand.  Anchorage soils are on stabilized sand dunes and beach ridges bordering rivers.  Slopes range from 0 to 45\npercent.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",
