  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arena series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils over a duripan that formed in mixed alluvium.  Arena soils are in flood plains or alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges 43 to 47 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to about 6 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 6 to 40 inches but occurs above the duripan.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section and dominantly are 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR except that in some pedons a few subhorizons have hue of 5YR or redder occur discontinuously and occupy less than half the thickness of the control section.  A seasonally high water table ranges from 1 to 2 feet below the surface.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction ranges from moderate to very strongly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon above the duripan has value of 5 through 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Mottles present are distinct to prominent.\nThe Csi horizon is at depths of 20 to 40 inches and ranges from 24 inches to several feet thick."
