Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
