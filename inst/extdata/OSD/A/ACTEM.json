  "OVERVIEW": "The Actem series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Actem soils are on hills and lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
