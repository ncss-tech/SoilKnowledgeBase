  "OVERVIEW": "The Azsand series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand over alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone. Azsand soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
