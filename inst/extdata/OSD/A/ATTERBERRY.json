Bethalto soils have a mean annual soil temperature of greater than 14 degrees C (56 degrees F). Canoe and Emery soils have a sand content of more than 8 percent in the particle-size control section. Curran soils contain more sand in their lower B horizons. Franklin, Millbrook, and Wauconda soils have horizons with more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches). Koszta soils are deeper to the layer highest in clay, and they have less contrast in clay content between the B and C horizons. Mulvey soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Virgil soils average more than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Atterberry soils typically are nearly level to gently sloping and are on moderately wide ridgetops or upland divides on till plains. Less commonly they are on loess covered benches or high stream terraces. They formed in areas of transition between prairie grass and deciduous forest. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges between 8 and 13 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation between 760 and 1020 millimeters (30 to 40 inches)."
