  "OVERVIEW": "The Adios series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained\nsoils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium from rhyolite and\nandesite.  Adios soils are on sides of buttes and have slopes of 8 to\n60 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 12 inches, and average annual air temperature is\nabout 47 degrees F.",
