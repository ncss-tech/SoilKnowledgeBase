  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Usually the soil between depths of 5 to 15 inches is continuously dry in all parts from late April or May until late October or November and is moist in some parts all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 65 F, and the soil temperature is usually not below 47 F at any time.  In some pedons, a few vertical cracks up to 1/4 inch wide occur to a depth of 20 inches or more but slickensides are absent.\nThe A horizon is brown, grayish brown, or dark grayish brown in 10YR hue.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter to a depth of more than 20 inches.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered sandstone or shale or both.  It lacks lime coatings on the upper fracture faces in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Agueda, Alo, Balcom, Bosanko, Conejo, Fontana, Gazos, and Nacimiento series.  Agueda and Conejo soils lack a paralithic contact.  Alo and Bosanko soils have clay texture and intersecting slickensides.  Balcom and Nacimiento soils are calcareous throughout.  Fontana soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and have free lime in the lower part of the solum.  Gazos soils have a lithic contact."

They formed in material weathered from fine grained sandstone and/or shale.  The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winter.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches, mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 F, average July temperature is about 69 to 74 F.   The frost-free season is about 300 to 350 days."

Cienaba soils have led than 18 percent clay and a paralithic contact at depth of less than 20 inches.  Myford soils have argillic horizons."
