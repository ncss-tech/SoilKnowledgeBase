  "OVERVIEW": "The Airship series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Airship soils are on steep hills that are remnant terraces. Slopes range from 30 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches (610 mm), and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F (16 degrees C).",
