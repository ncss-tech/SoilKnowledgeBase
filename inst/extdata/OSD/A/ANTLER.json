  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The upper part of the control section is lacustrine sediments typically 20 to 34 inches thick over glacial till.  The lacustrine sediments are high in very fine sand and typically contain less than 25 percent fine and coarser sand.  The upper part of the 10- to 40-inch control section averages more than 18 percent clay.  The glacial till contains higher amounts of rock fragments and, consequently, the control section averages between 15 and 25 percent fine and coarser sand.  In some pedons a layer of sand, gravel, or stones ranging up to 6 inches thick is at the contact between the lacustrine sediments and the glacial till.  Saline and stony phases are recognized.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and  3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It contains 15 to over 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It does not have gypsum crystals in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Bkyz horizons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam or gravelly clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have 2Bky, 2By or 2BCy horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It commonly has few to many low and high chroma mottles.  It is loam or clay loam and contains 2 to 10 percent coarse fragments.  It does not have gypsum crystals in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gilby, Hamerly and Tetonview series.  Gilby soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the control section.  Hamerly soils formed entirely in glacial till and do not have silty upper horizons.  Tetonview soils have an O horizon and are at elevations above 3800 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Antler soils are on level on glacial lake plains and in interbeach areas.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in silty lacustrine sediments over loam and clay loam glacial till.  The climate is cool subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 23 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Gilby and Lankin soils are on similar landscapes on nearby interbeach areas.  Bearden, Colvin, Glyndon and Overly soils are on nearby lake plains where sediments are thicker than 40 inches.  Bearden soils are fine-silty.  Colvin soils are poorly drained.  Glyndon soils are coarse-silty.  Lankin and Overly soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick and have Bw horizons.  Tonka soils are in depressions and have an albic horizon."

Permeability of the lacustrine sediments is moderate or moderately slow, and permeability of the glacial till is moderately slow or slow.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet at some time during the period April through June."
