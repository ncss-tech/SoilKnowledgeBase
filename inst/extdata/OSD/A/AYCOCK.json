  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.  The lower B and C horizons, in many pedons, contain plinthite nodules, but no horizon within 60 inches of the surface has as much as 5 percent plinthite.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of brown or yellow may occur in any part of the Bt horizon except the Bt1.  Iron depletions in shades of gray may occur in the Bt horizon below a depth of 30 inches.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or red may occur anywhere in the Bt horizon.  Some pedons have a Btg horizon below a depth of 48 inches that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is commonly clay loam, but includes loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam.  Thin layers of clay or silty clay are in some pedons.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of yellow, brown, or gray may occur, as well as masses of iron accumulation in shades of red or brown.  The texture range is the same as for the Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of yellow, brown or gray occur, as well as masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is variable.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is variable."

Bewleyville, Curtistown, and Mountview soils have Bt and/or 2Bt horizon in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.  Blevins soils have B horizons with a bisequum clay distribution.  Silerton soils have a lithologic discontinuity with silty material 1.5 to 3 feet thick overlying clayey coastal plain sediments."

Exum and Goldsboro soils are moderately well drained and are slightly lower or further from drainageways than Aycock soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Nahunta soils and the poorly drained Grantham soils are in depressions or further from drainageways on the landscape.  The well drained Nobocco and Norfolk soils are in the same landscape positions as Aycock.  The well drained Orangeburg soils are higher or nearer to drainageways than Aycock soils.  In addition, Nobocco, Norfolk and Orangeburg soils are in a fine-loamy family."
