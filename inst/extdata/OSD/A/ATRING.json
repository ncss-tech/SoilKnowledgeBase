  "OVERVIEW": "The Atring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone, siltstone and metasedimentary rocks.  Atring soils are on ridges and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 12 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days after the summer solstice at depths of 4 to 12 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, or gravelly silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly silt loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  It has 35 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nA C horizon, when present, has partially weathered fragments of sandstone with material that ranges from loam to sandy loam in texture."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and siltstone in the Coast Range and from metasedimentary rocks in the Klamath Mountains.  The climate is characterized by cool moist to wet winters and warm to hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 60 inches but in areas of high winter rainfall may range to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F, mean July temperature is 66 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 210 days."
