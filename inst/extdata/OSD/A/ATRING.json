  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and siltstone in the Coast Range and from metasedimentary rocks in the Klamath Mountains.  The climate is characterized by cool moist to wet winters and warm to hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 60 inches but in areas of high winter rainfall may range to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F, mean July temperature is 66 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 210 days."
