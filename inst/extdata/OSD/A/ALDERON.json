  "OVERVIEW": "The Alderon series consists of moderately deep to weathered granite, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from granite.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep, foothills, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
