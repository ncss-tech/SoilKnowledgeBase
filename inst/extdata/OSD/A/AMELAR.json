  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Amelar soils are on hills, mountains, fan remnants, and partial ballenas.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, and calcareous shale. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,070 to 2,900 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid, with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
