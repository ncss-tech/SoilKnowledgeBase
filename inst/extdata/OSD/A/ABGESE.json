  "OVERVIEW": "The Abgese series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Abgese soils are on terraces, fan remnants, and low hills.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C.",
