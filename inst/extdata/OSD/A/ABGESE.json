These soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium from volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 8 percent but range up to 40 percent in Idaho.  Elevations of 1,860 to 2,140 meters in Nevada and 790 to 1,220 meters in Idaho.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
