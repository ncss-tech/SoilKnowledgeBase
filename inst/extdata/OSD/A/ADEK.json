  "OVERVIEW": "The Adek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone. Adek soils are on convex mountain sideslopes, ridges, ridgetops and summits. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
