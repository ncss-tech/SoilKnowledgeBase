The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from limestone. Elevation is from 6,300 to 9,000 feet. The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer. The average annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches; average annual temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F. Frost-free period is 10 to 60 days."
