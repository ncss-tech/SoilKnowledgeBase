  "OVERVIEW": "The Amboat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff.  They are on summits.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Eep soils occur on breaks and scarp faces, and are ashy-skeletal.  Forvic and Oshone soils occur on terraces, and are moderately deep to a hardpan.  Hogmalat soils occur on higher summit shoulders, are shallow to welded tuff, and are cryic.  Keman soils occur on summit backslopes, are cryic and loamy-skeletal."
