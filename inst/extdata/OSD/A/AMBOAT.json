Brose soils are shallow to welded tuff, and are not skeletal.  Congle and Doodlelink occur on sideslopes, footslopes, and breaks, and are pachic.  Eep soils occur on breaks and scarp faces, and are ashy-skeletal.  Forvic and Oshone soils occur on terraces, and are moderately deep to a hardpan.  Hogmalat soils occur on higher summit shoulders, are shallow to welded tuff, and are cryic.  Keman soils occur on summit backslopes, are cryic and loamy-skeletal."
