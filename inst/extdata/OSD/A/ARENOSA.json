  "OVERVIEW": "The Arenosa series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from Eocene age sandstone of the Claiborne Group. These gently to strongly sloping soils occur on summits and shoulders of interfluves of broad ridges on inland dissected coastal plain. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",

The native plant community is an open savannah of sandjack oak, post oak, and blackjack oak trees. Yaupon shrubs are associated with the trees. The herbaceous component is tall and midgrasses dominated by little bluestem, yellow and slender indiangrass, and brownseed paspalum. A thin stand of purple lovegrass, red lovegrass, woolly sheath threeawn, Halls panicum, and thin paspalum occupy spaces between the tall grasses. Continuous overgrazing or over rest and the absence of fire tend to allow a vegetative shift towards woody species. Ecological site number: R087AY239TX (Very Deep Sand 28-40\" PZ)."

The Eufaula series has an argillic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) [C1 and C2 horizons]\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) [A horizon]\nOther features: less than 5 percent silt plus 2 times clay content in the particle size control section\nUstic soil moisture regime\nAdditional comments:\nThe Key to Classes of Coatings of Sands was revised with the adoption of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Seventh Edition, 1996. Previous editions defined the uncoated class as less than 5 percent silt plus clay in the particle size control section. The series concept has been revised which excludes some soils previously classified as uncoated which are now in the coated class."
