  "OVERVIEW": "The Akerue series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to a duripan.  These soils formed in residuum derived from andesite, rhyolite, and quartzite.  Akerue soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
