    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Akerue soils are on hills and mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum derived from andesite, rhyolite, and quartzite.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,865 to 2,135 feet.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 to 300 cm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days."
