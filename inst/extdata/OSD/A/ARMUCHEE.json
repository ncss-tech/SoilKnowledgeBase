    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Depth to shale bedrock containing little or no fine-earth ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed.  Fragments of soft and moderately hard shale range from 5 to 25 percent in the A horizon, from 15 to 35 percent in the B horizon, and from 40 to 85 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Severely eroded areas also have hue of 5YR and chroma of 6.  The fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red.  The fine-earth fraction of the Bt horizon is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.  In the particle size control section, clay content averages between 37 and 47 percent, silt content between 40 and 60 percent and sand content is less than 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  The fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Armuchee is the only series in this family. Litz, Montevallo, Mountainburg, Talladega, Tallapoosa, and Townley series are in closely related families.  Litz soils are mesic and have discontinuous argillic horizons.  Montevallo soils lack argillic horizons and have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Mountainburg soils are less than 20 inches deep to hard rock.  Talladega and Tallapoosa soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section, and Talladega soils have argillic horizons that are interrupted by bedrock.  Tallapoosa soils also have soft schist bedrock within 20 inches.  Townley soils have argillic horizons more than 10 inches thick."

Leadvale soils are on lower lying gentle slopes and have a fragipan."
