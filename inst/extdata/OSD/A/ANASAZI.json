  "STATES": "AZ,CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Anasazi series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and reworked eolian material weathered from sandstone or limestone.  Anasazi soils are on dissected pediments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
