Abracon, Chroder, Cobbra, Harvey, Milok, Mivida, Nala and Yattle soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Chugcity soils have paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Chupadera soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR and lack cambic horizons. Sazi soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Chugcity, Chupadera, Harvey, Nala, and Yattle soils are in the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Anasazi soils are on dissected pediments, cuestas and hills at elevations of 5,400 to 7,000 feet. Slope gradients are 2 to 25 percent. These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum and reworked eolian material weathered from sandstone or limestone. The climate is semiarid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. and the freeze-free period ranges from 90 to 170 days."
