The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days or more in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 70 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 30 percent are cobbles.  The soils have an ochric epipedon.  It is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Rock fragments average 15 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It is clay loam or loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon is loamy sand or sandy loam.  Rock fragments average 45 to 80 percent of which 10 to 40 percent are cobbles."
