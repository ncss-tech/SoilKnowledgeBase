  "OVERVIEW": "The Abegg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic bedrock.  Abegg soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches (1140 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).",
