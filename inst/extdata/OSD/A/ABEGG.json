  "OVERVIEW": "The Abegg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic bedrock.  Abegg soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days or more in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 70 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 30 percent are cobbles.  The soils have an ochric epipedon.  It is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Rock fragments average 15 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It is clay loam or loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon is loamy sand or sandy loam.  Rock fragments average 45 to 80 percent of which 10 to 40 percent are cobbles."
