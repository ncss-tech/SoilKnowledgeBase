  "OVERVIEW": "The Amor series consists of well drained, moderately permeable soils that are moderately deep to soft sandstone bedrock.  They formed in material weathered from stratified soft sandstone, siltstone and mudstone.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual air precipitation is 15 inches.",

The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 15 to 40 percent fine sand and coarser.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  Some pedons contain up to 15 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It is non-effervescent to slightly effervescent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains from 5 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Carbonates are both disseminated and in masses.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon with similar properties.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  It has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam.

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches.  Precipitation comes in the spring and summer.

Arnegard soils are in concave swales and on foot slopes.  They do not have paralithic beds within a depth of 40 inches and have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.   Cabba and Flasher soils are on adjacent steeply sloping uplands.  They have paralithic beds at depths of less than 20 inches.  Reeder soils are on less sloping upland areas adjacent to the Amor soils.  They have argillic horizons.  Vebar soils are on adjacent uplands.  They are coarse-loamy."
