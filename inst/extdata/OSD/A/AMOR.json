    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft sandstone typically is 30 to 40 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 15 to 40 percent fine sand and coarser.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  Some pedons contain up to 15 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It is non-effervescent to slightly effervescent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains from 5 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Carbonates are both disseminated and in masses.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon with similar properties.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  It has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is stratified soft fine grained sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone.  Some pedons have carbonate accumulations below the top of the bedrock."

Azaar soils have indurated sandstone bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Diagulch, Max, Peerless, Quigley, Shambo, Tansem and Twin Creek soils do not have paralithic beds within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tewfel soils have paralithic beds of shale within depths of 20 to 40 inches and have a frost-free period of less than 90 days."

The soils formed in residuum weathered from stratified soft sandstone, siltstone and mudstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches.  Precipitation comes in the spring and summer.  It ranges up to 20 inches in the foothills of the mountains.  The frost-free season ranges from 110 to 135 days."

Arnegard soils are in concave swales and on foot slopes.  They do not have paralithic beds within a depth of 40 inches and have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.   Cabba and Flasher soils are on adjacent steeply sloping uplands.  They have paralithic beds at depths of less than 20 inches.  Reeder soils are on less sloping upland areas adjacent to the Amor soils.  They have argillic horizons.  Vebar soils are on adjacent uplands.  They are coarse-loamy."
