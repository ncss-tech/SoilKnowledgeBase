  "OVERVIEW": "The Alflack series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to noncalcareous, fractured sandstone.  They formed in sandstone residuum on mountain hillsides.  Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 cm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",

Also, Comad soils have an E and Bt horizons; Obscurity and Studebaker soils contain 15 to 50 percent volcanic ash; and Ovando soils have lamellae.  Stecum soils formed in material weathered from granite and gneiss and contain over 50 percent coarse sand."
