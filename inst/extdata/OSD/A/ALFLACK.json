  "OVERVIEW": "The Alflack series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to noncalcareous, fractured sandstone.  They formed in sandstone residuum on mountain hillsides.  Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 cm, and the mean annual temperature is about 1.1 degrees C.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 0 to 3 degrees C., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 6 to 8 degrees C.  Rock fragments are mainly sandstone channers and flagstones.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The matrix texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent."

Also, Comad soils have an E and Bt horizons; Obscurity and Studebaker soils contain 15 to 50 percent volcanic ash; and Ovando soils have lamellae.  Stecum soils formed in material weathered from granite and gneiss and contain over 50 percent coarse sand."
