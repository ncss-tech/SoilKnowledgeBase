  "OVERVIEW": "The Alflack series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to noncalcareous, fractured sandstone.  They formed in sandstone residuum on mountain hillsides.  Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 37 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  Rock fragments are mainly sandstone channers and flagstones.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The matrix texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent."

Also, Comad soils have an E and Bt horizons; Obscurity and Studebaker soils contain 15 to 50 percent volcanic ash; and Ovando soils have lamellae.  Stecum soils formed in material weathered from granite and gneiss and contain over 50 percent coarse sand."
