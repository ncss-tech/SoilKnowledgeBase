  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Bulk density of the fine earth fraction is assumed to range from 1.0 to 0.85 gm/cc.  The exchange complex is dominated by amorphous materials.  The base saturation is between 25 and 50 percent throughout the profile.  The thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 20 to 38 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 35 percent throughout the soil.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 43 to 46 degrees F and summer temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist throughout but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches from late July until early October.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/3, 4/3 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is gravelly.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure and is strongly to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with dry color of 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is gravelly.  It has subangular blocky structure or is massive and is strongly acid or slightly acid."

Elevations are 5,500 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is typified by warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches, most of which occurs as snow.  Mean January temperature is 27 degrees F; mean July temperature is 60 degrees F; and mean annual temperature varies from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 50 to 70 days."

The Hach kit test for base saturation on a sample from near the paralithic contact showed 35 percent.  This soil was originally proposed as a medial, frigid Umbric Vitrandept but is now being proposed as a medial, frigid Andic Xerumbrept.  This soil is also Pachic however to parallel Haplumbrepts Andic will take precedence over Pachic.\nLast revised by the state on 12/75.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.  Competing series not updated at that time."
