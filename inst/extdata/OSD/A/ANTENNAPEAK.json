  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Antennapeak soils are on slightly concave, mountain backslopes. These soils formed in colluvium derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 2,400 to 2,750 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers that receive an increase in moisture during the winter from wind blown snow. Antennapeak soils accumulate wind blown snow from mountain ridges. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."

Wiltop soils average 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Winu soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and a lithic contact between 50 to 100 cm. Winz soils have a mean annual summer soil temperature 7 to 8 degrees C."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Antennapeak soils are used for livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, low sagebrush, and snowberry. Freezing at some depth and/or prolonged spring saturation from snowmelt may be preventing growth of mountain big sagebrush on most sites. This pedon is correlated to ecological site number R028AY061NV, Claypan 14+ P.Z."
