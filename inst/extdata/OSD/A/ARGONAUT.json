Some rock fragments are present throughout the soil with about 2 to 25 percent in the lower Bt horizons and 5 to 35 percent in the A and upper Bt horizons.  It has 2 to 6 percent organic matter in the upper 4 inches and more than 1 percent to a depth of 10 inches.  The weighted average of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 6/6, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, or 4/6.
