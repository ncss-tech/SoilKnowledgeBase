    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 67 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 24 inches or to a paralithic contact is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 15 (120 to 150 days) and is moist in all parts from November 15 to May 15 (165 to 195 days).  Some rock fragments are present throughout the soil with about 2 to 25 percent in the lower Bt horizons and 5 to 35 percent in the A and upper Bt horizons.  It has 2 to 6 percent organic matter in the upper 4 inches and more than 1 percent to a depth of 10 inches.  The weighted average of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 6/6, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, or 4/6.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 5YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, or 4/6.  The upper 4 inches have moist color values of 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam and may be gravelly or extremely stony.  It is massive and hard or the upper few inches has weak platy, weak granular or weak subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral .\nThere is a transitional horizon between the A and B horizon or a gradual boundary occurs for the A horizon.  The upper Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 4/4, or 4/6.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6; 5YR 4/4, 4/6, or 3/4.  It is heavy loam, heavy silt loam, clay loam or its gravelly or cobbly equivalents.  Reaction is  moderately acid to neutral.  An abrupt boundary is always present.\nThe lower Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 7YR 5/4, 5/6, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 4/6, 5/6, or 4/4.

The clay increase between the upper Bt and lower Bt exceeds 15 percent.  In some profiles a stone line separates these two horizons.\nThe Cr is 10YR 7/6, 2.5Y 7/4, or 6/4.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 6/4 or 5/4."
