The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 62 degrees F. Depth to stratified alluvium is 11 to 14 inches. Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent in the surface horizon and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. The soil is saline-sodic in some part during the year.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 4/1, 5/1 or 5/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2; 5Y 2/1, 2/2, 3/1 or 3/2. Faint to prominent moist redoximorphic concentrations are present in some pedons. Texture is sandy loam or loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent. Gypsum content is 0 to 3 percent. Electrical conductivity is 0 to 16 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 30. Electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio and gypsum content are affected by agricultural practices and the depth to a high water table. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has color of 10YR 5/1; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7/2; 5Y 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 7/1 or 7/2.

Texture is stratified sandy loam, loam or clay loam and clay content averages 20 to 35 percent, but the particle-size control section has thin horizons that range from sand to clay. Clay content is 18 to 35 percent in the upper part and 0 to 45 percent in the lower part. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 10 percent. Gypsum content is 0 to 4 percent. Electrical conductivity is 0 to 30 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 80. Electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio and gypsum content are affected by agricultural practices and the depth to a high water table. Some pedons contain up to 15 percent durinodes and/or carbonate concretions at a depth below 40 inches. Reaction is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

This soil is protected from flooding by dams, canals and levees. Negligible or low runoff; moderately slow or slow permeability due to sodicity and stratification. A perched water table occurs at a depth of 24 to 72 inches from January through December. The soil is wet throughout from December through March, unless drained.
