    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is 60 inches or more deep. The soil is saturated in some part during the year, unless artificially drained. The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 62 degrees F. Depth to stratified alluvium is 11 to 14 inches. Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent in the surface horizon and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. The soil is saline-sodic in some part during the year.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 4/1, 5/1 or 5/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2; 5Y 2/1, 2/2, 3/1 or 3/2. Faint to prominent moist redoximorphic concentrations are present in some pedons. Texture is sandy loam or loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent. Gypsum content is 0 to 3 percent. Electrical conductivity is 0 to 16 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 30. Electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio and gypsum content are affected by agricultural practices and the depth to a high water table. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has color of 10YR 5/1; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7/2; 5Y 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 7/1 or 7/2.

Texture is stratified sandy loam, loam or clay loam and clay content averages 20 to 35 percent, but the particle-size control section has thin horizons that range from sand to clay. Clay content is 18 to 35 percent in the upper part and 0 to 45 percent in the lower part. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 10 percent. Gypsum content is 0 to 4 percent. Electrical conductivity is 0 to 30 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 80. Electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio and gypsum content are affected by agricultural practices and the depth to a high water table. Some pedons contain up to 15 percent durinodes and/or carbonate concretions at a depth below 40 inches. Reaction is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

Elevations are 115 to 250 feet. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 8 inches. Mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 82 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F. Frost-free season is 220 to 275 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; This soil has altered drainage because of dams and reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada, pumping from the water table, the use of tile and interceptor drains, and filling and leveling of the sloughs in the vicinity. This soil is protected from flooding by dams, canals and levees. Negligible or low runoff; moderately slow or slow permeability due to sodicity and stratification. A perched water table occurs at a depth of 24 to 72 inches from January through December. The soil is wet throughout from December through March, unless drained. The soil remains moist below a depth of 6 inches from April through November, unless drained."
