  "OVERVIEW": "The Amal series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and eolian material derived from shale.  Amal soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",

Its unclear at this time whether the series has some secondary carbonates below 40 inches, or contains enough carbonates to qualify as a calcic horizon.  It should be one or the other, but not both.  The calcic horizon is retained for now, until more of this soil is observed in the field)."
