Its unclear at this time whether the series has some secondary carbonates below 40 inches, or contains enough carbonates to qualify as a calcic horizon.  It should be one or the other, but not both.  The calcic horizon is retained for now, until more of this soil is observed in the field).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
