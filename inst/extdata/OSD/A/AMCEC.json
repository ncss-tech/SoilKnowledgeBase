  "OVERVIEW": "The Amcec series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian material and slope alluvium over residuum derived from cinders. Amcec soils are on cinder cones. Slopes range from 10 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
