  "OVERVIEW": "The Arawak series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils on summits and side slopes of limestone hills and mountains.  They formed in material weathered from soft limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.",

Rock fragments include pebbles, cobbles, flags, and boulders composed of limestone or coral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of rock fragments range from 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Soft masses of calcium carbonate range from few to many.  Content of rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of soft limestone.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4; or it has no dominant matrix color and the horizon is multicolored in shades of pink, white, and brown."
