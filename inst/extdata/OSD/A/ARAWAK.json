Rock fragments include pebbles, cobbles, flags, and boulders composed of limestone or coral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of rock fragments range from 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Soft masses of calcium carbonate range from few to many.  Content of rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of soft limestone.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4; or it has no dominant matrix color and the horizon is multicolored in shades of pink, white, and brown."
