  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section has 60 to 75 percent fine or coarse sand and 5 to 10 percent clay in the fine earth fraction. Depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 7 to 11 inches has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus  iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It has a moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe AB horizon, when present, is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. The upper part of the Bw horizon contains 0 to 10 percent sandstone paragravel and the lower part 10 to 35 percent.\nThe BC horizon is sandy loam or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kiper (T), Micapeak (T), Ojibway, Quinnamose (T), and Switchback series.  Kiper soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Micapeak soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and contain 10 to 20 percent mica in the particle-size control section.  Ojibway soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and are dominated by rock and pararock fragments of amphibolite origin.  Quinnamose soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Switchback soils have 5 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles of granodirorite origin.  Soils with a similar classification except for mixed mineralogy are the Cannell, Kriest and Rogue series.  All these soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ampad soils are on cuestas and backslopes and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from Rosyln and Swauk sandstone with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Sandstone parafragments are semi- rounded light gray (10YR 7/2) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fresh face. The weathering rind is reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8). Elevation ranges from 2,100 to 3,600 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The growingseason is 145 to 170 days."
