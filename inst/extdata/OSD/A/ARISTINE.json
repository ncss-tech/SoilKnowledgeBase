    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon, a cambic horizon from 10 to 29 inches, andic soil properties from the mineral soil surface to 29 inches, and a cemented layer from 29 to 38 inches.  The particle-size control section is  from 1 to 29 inches.  There is currently no provision for the correct classification of this soil in Soil Taxonomy.  The series also meets the saturation requirements for Oxyaquic subgroup, the aluminum requirements for alic subgroup and the organic matter requirements for fulvi great group.  All depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL pedons S93WA-045-001 and S91WA-45-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
