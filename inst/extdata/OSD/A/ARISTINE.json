  "OVERVIEW": "The Aristine series consists of moderately deep to a cemented layer, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium over dense glacial till.  Aristine soils are on glacial valleys and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 105 inches and average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon, a cambic horizon from 10 to 29 inches, andic soil properties from the mineral soil surface to 29 inches, and a cemented layer from 29 to 38 inches.  The particle-size control section is  from 1 to 29 inches.  There is currently no provision for the correct classification of this soil in Soil Taxonomy.  The series also meets the saturation requirements for Oxyaquic subgroup, the aluminum requirements for alic subgroup and the organic matter requirements for fulvi great group.  All depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon."
