The soil formed in alluvium derived from intrusive rocks, sedimentary rocks, and volcanic rocks.  Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 10,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 24 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in July and August.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 50 to 80 days."
