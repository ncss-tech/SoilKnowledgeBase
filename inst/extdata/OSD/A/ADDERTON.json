  "OVERVIEW": "The Adderton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from various intrusive rocks, sedimentary rocks, and from volcanic breccia.  Adderton soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, stream terraces, fans, and toe slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
