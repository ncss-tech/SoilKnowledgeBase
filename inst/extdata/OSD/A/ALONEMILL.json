  "BYREV": "Rev. PLS, MHC, DGF",
  "REVDATE": "01/2006",
  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Alonemill series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains.  They formed in mixed alluvium from soil material weathered from sandstone, siltstone, limestone, and shale.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

Berks and Weikert soils have bedrock within 40 inches, contain more coarse fragments in the control section and are on uplands.  Moomaw soils have a fragipan layer, an argillic horizons and are on stream terraces.  Frederick, Groseclose, and Hagerstown soils have argillic horizons and are on uplands."

The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data.  Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data becomes available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision date 10/92\nSIR= VA0372\nMLRA= 125, 128, 147\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
