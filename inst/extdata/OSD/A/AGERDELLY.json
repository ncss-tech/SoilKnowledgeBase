The soils are formed from volcanic tuff or siltstone.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost free season is 130 to 145 days."

Bakeoven soils are very shallow over basalt.  Deshler and Glasgow soils are moderately deep over tuff.  Deterson and Lanktree soils have fine textured particle-size control sections and lack slickensides.  Devnot and Reywat are shallow over basalt.  Lankbush soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Bakeoven, Deshler, Devnot, Glasgow, and Reywat soils are on mountain slopes.  Deterson, Lankbush, and Lanktree soils are on foothills and terraces.  Payette soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and are on high stream terraces."
