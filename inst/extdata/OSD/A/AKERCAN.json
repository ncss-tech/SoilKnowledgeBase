  "OVERVIEW": "The Akercan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Akercan soils are on inset fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
