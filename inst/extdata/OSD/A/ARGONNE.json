Horizonation below the spodic horizon has a wide range depending on the extent to which eluviation has occurred and the depth to the fragipan. Therefore, there can be E/B, E/Bx, B/E, or B/Ex horizons singly or in combination, with or without Bt, Btx, BC, or BCx horizons.\nCation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data from NSSL.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska-user pedonids 88WI041002, 90WI041005, and 90WI041012 (http://ssldata.sc.egov.usda.gov/).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
