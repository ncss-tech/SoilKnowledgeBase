  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is clay with clay content of 40 to 60 percent.  The base saturation ranges from 18 to 35 percent in the lower Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon is dark brown, brown, or light brown, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4, in hue of 7.5YR and 10YR.  It is fine sandy loam, loam; stony phases are recognized.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.  A thin E horizon that is 1 or 2 units of value lighter in color than the A horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizons are red, light red, yellowish red, reddish brown, reddish yellow, or brown, values of 4 to 6, chroma of 4 to 6, in hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR.  Mottles of red, yellowish red, brown, strong brown, gray, or brownish gray range from none to few in upper Bt horizons and few to many in the lower Bt horizons.  The gray mottles are inherited from the gray shale.  Texture is clay with clay content ranging from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through medium acid.\nThe Cr horizon is stratified and mottled in shades of red, brown, gray, and yellow.  It is shaly clay or very shaly clay.  In some pedons the shaly Cr horizon contains thin bands of weakly cemented sandstone and bands of unconsolidated earth.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Hearne and Marquez series in the same family and the similar Birome and Truce series.  Birome soils have more than 35 percent base saturation and are underlain by sandstone at 20 to 40 inches depth.  Hearne soils do not have a paralithic contact of shale and have mica flakes in the C horizon.  They also formed in Tertiary Age parent materials.  Marquez soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick.  Truce soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent and in addition have sola more than 40 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in acid shaley clays mainly in the Lewisville member of the Woodbine Formation of Upper Cretaceous Age.  Climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 52 to 64."
