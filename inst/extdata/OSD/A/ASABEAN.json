    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soil between a depth of 8 to 22 inches is dry in all parts from June to October and is moist in all parts from December to May.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 35 to 65 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3; or 7.5YR 7/6 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/3, or 4/4.  The texture is mainly gravelly loam and commonly contains 15 to 25 percent clay, 15 to 35 percent pebbles, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles by volume.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 80 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 7/3, 7/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6, 7/3, 7/4 or 7/6 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, or 4/6.  The texture is typically very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam and less commonly very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 30 to 55 percent pebbles, and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 65 percent.  Base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  It is medium acid or strongly acid."

The Abegg soils are dry for only 60 to 90 consecutive days in the summer.  Callayomi soils have Bt horizons which are neutral or slightly acid.  In addition Calla-yomi soils are influenced by amorphors material.  Behemotosh, Hollowtree, Marpa, Skalan and Whispering (T) series are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Holohan soil are moist in all parts for more than 180 consecutive days."
