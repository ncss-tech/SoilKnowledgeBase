  "OVERVIEW": "The Aptos series consists of  moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone, mudstone or shale. Aptos soils are on uplands and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The soil between depths of 7 and 21 inches is usually dry between mid-July and mid-October and usually moist between the end of December and the end of April. The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 to 59 degrees F. Organic matter content is more than 1 percent at a depth of 20 to 30 inches. Base saturation is more than 50 percent in all parts and less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the profile to a depth of 30 inches. Fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark gray, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, or brown (10YR 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2). Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe B2t horizon is dark gray, gray, grayish brown, brown or yellowish brown (10YR 4/1, 5/1, 4/2 5/2, 5/3, 5/4) and in places, at a depth greater than 20 inches, pale brown (10YR 6/3) or 2.5Y 6/4. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam or clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay. This horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. In some pedons a 3 to 5 inch thick C horizon underlies the B2t horizon."
