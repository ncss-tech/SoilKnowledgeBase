The soil between depth of about 6 to 20 inches is usually dry all of the time from July 15 until November 1 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 to 47 F.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/3; 4/3; 5/2 and 5/3.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/2; 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR, 2/2 and 3/2.  It is or clay loam and has 5 to 10 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/4. 5/4; and 10YR 5/3.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4 or 10YR 3/4.  Texture is clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Absolute increase inn clay from the A horizon is less than 20 percent.  It may be gravelly or cobbly and ranges from 5 to 15 percent gravel, and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments average less than 35 percent.  It is medium acid to neutral."

Slope ranges from 2 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from basic volcanic flows, breccias and agglomerates.   The mean annual precipitation varies from 15 to 35 inches and the mean annual temperature varies from 43 to 47 F.  Mean January temperature is about 27 F and mean July temperature is about 60 F.
