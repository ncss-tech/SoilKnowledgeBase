    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ashone soils are on plateaus, mountains, and hills.  They occur on south-facing shoulder and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar pyroclastic volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,770 to 1,955 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
