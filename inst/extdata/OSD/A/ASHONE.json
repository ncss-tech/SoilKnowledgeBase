  "OVERVIEW": "The Ashone series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks.  Ashone soils are on plateaus, mountains, and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
