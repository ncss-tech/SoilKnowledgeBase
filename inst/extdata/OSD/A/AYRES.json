  "OVERVIEW": "The Ayres series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from rhyolite with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Ayres soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants and have slopes of 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

They are usually  dry, and are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 120 cumulative days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees.  Depth to the duripan is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages over 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 15 to 30 percent rounded gravel and 20 to 30 percent rounded cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, and 4 through 6 dry.  It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, and contains 25 to 35 percent clay.  It contains 20 to 35 percent rounded gravel and 20 to 50 percent rounded cobbles.\nThe Bqm or Bkqm horizon is indurated or very strongly cemented to a depth of 40 inches or more."
