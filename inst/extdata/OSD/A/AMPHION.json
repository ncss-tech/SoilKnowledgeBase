  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Amphion series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clay loams and sandy clay loams.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands. Slopes are mostly less than 2 percent but range up to 3 percent.",

Depth to secondary calcium carbonate is 28 to 50 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are neutral to moderately alkaline. Texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay with a clay content of 35 to 50 percent.\nThe Btk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  In pedons with matrix colors containing chromas of 5 or less mottling is reddish or yellowish and always includes common or many coarse mottles with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR with chroma of 5 to 8 extending to depths below 60 inches.  Texture is clay, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  Some pedons have few to common crystalline gypsum bodies occurring below 36 inches."

Clareville soils lack coarse mottles with chromas of 5 or more in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Cuero and Racombes soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Elmendorf soils have a COLE of more than 0.07 in the upper 1.25 meters."
