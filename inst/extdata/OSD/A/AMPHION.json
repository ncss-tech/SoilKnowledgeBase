Clareville soils lack coarse mottles with chromas of 5 or more in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Cuero and Racombes soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Elmendorf soils have a COLE of more than 0.07 in the upper 1.25 meters."

The soil formed in calcareous clay loams and sandy clay loams.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 34 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 240 to 290 days and elevation ranges from 500 to 1,500 feet.  The annual Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 31 to 40."

Caid soils are in similar positions and have fine-loamy control sections and are calcareous throughout.  Duval and Webb soils occupy higher areas of the landscape.  Duval soils have reddish less clayey subsoils, and Webb soils lack mollic epipedons.  Zavco soils occur on similar or higher areas in the landscape and have hues redder than 10YR in the Bt horizon."
