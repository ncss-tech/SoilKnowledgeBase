  "OVERVIEW": "The Ade series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in wind and water deposited sands.  These soils are on terraces and uplands and have slopes ranging from l to l2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.",
