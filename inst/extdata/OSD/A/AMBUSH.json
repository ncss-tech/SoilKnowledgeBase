  "OVERVIEW": "The Ambush series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits derived from limestone and welded tuff.  Ambush soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
