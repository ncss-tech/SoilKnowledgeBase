  "OVERVIEW": "The Alyan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Alyan soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
