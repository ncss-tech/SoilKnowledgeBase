  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alyan soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They occur on all slope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,290 meters in Nevada to as low as 1,280 meters in Oregon.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is typically 70 to 100 days, but may range down to 50 days in Oregon."
