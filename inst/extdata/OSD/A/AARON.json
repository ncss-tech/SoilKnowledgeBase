  "OVERVIEW": "The Aaron series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on upland ridges and side slopes.  They formed in residuum of interbedded limestone, calcareous shale, and siltstone.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the average annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. In some pedons the bedrock is soft and  in some pedons there is a thin loess cap.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the the A and B horizons. Reaction in the BC and C horizons range from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Coarse fragments of limestone, siltstone, and shale range from 0 to 14 percent in the Ap and Bt horizons, and 0 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have BA horizons with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon mottles that have chroma of 2 or less range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC and C horizons have colors like the Bt horizon. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their channery analogues."

Celina soils have silt loam or loam textured C horizons of calcareous glacial till.  Guernsey soils have a discontinuity in the B horizon.  Hartville soils are more acid and lack rock fragments in the solum. Lewisburg soils have a thinner sola and in addition have glacial pebbles  and stones throughout.  Licking soils have a discontinuity within the control section.  Vandergrift and Whippany soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in their B horizons.  Beasley, Caneyville, Eden, Faywood, Fredonia, Lowell, and Markland soils do not have mottles that have chroma of 2 or lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon."
