  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. In some pedons the bedrock is soft and  in some pedons there is a thin loess cap.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the the A and B horizons. Reaction in the BC and C horizons range from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Coarse fragments of limestone, siltstone, and shale range from 0 to 14 percent in the Ap and Bt horizons, and 0 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have BA horizons with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon mottles that have chroma of 2 or less range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC and C horizons have colors like the Bt horizon. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their channery analogues."

Celina soils have silt loam or loam textured C horizons of calcareous glacial till.  Guernsey soils have a discontinuity in the B horizon.  Hartville soils are more acid and lack rock fragments in the solum. Lewisburg soils have a thinner sola and in addition have glacial pebbles  and stones throughout.  Licking soils have a discontinuity within the control section.  Vandergrift and Whippany soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in their B horizons.  Beasley, Caneyville, Eden, Faywood, Fredonia, Lowell, and Markland soils do not have mottles that have chroma of 2 or lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon."

These soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded limestone, siltstone, and calcareous shale.  The geographic area of these soils have an average annual precipitation of 45 inches, and an average temperature of 55 degrees F."
