  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. In some pedons the bedrock is soft and  in some pedons there is a thin loess cap.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the the A and B horizons. Reaction in the BC and C horizons range from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Coarse fragments of limestone, siltstone, and shale range from 0 to 14 percent in the Ap and Bt horizons, and 0 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have BA horizons with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon mottles that have chroma of 2 or less range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC and C horizons have colors like the Bt horizon. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their channery analogues."

Celina soils have silt loam or loam textured C horizons of calcareous glacial till.  Guernsey soils have a discontinuity in the B horizon.  Hartville soils are more acid and lack rock fragments in the solum. Lewisburg soils have a thinner sola and in addition have glacial pebbles  and stones throughout.  Licking soils have a discontinuity within the control section.  Vandergrift and Whippany soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in their B horizons.  Beasley, Caneyville, Eden, Faywood, Fredonia, Lowell, and Markland soils do not have mottles that have chroma of 2 or lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon."
