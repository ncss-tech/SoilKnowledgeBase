  "OVERVIEW": "The Agra series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale or clay, of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on convex interfluves and side slopes of hillslopes on low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 in).",
