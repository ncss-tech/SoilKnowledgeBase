  "REVDATE": "01/2000",
  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Averlande series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Averlande soils are on broad ridgetops and stable benches of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
