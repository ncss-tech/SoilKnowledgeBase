Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A and BAt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist and dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist and dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 35 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 400 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
