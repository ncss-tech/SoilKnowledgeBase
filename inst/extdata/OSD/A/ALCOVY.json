  "OVERVIEW": "The Alcovy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in old valley fill material and in the underlying residuum on uplands in the Piedmont province. Permeability is moderately rapid in the surface and subsurface layers, and slow in the lower part of the subsoil. Slopes are 2 to 10 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed. Some pedons may contain few to common flakes of mica throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Mottles in shades of red, brown and yellow are none to many.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Mottles in shades of red, brown and yellow are common or many or some horizons are mottled in the same colors. Gray mottles occur in the lower Btx horizon. Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay loam. Brittleness is 10 to 55 percent, but is at least 40 percent in some part of the Btx horizon. Plinthite is 0 to 4 percent.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has color same as the Btx horizons or is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray. Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8 or it may be mottled in the same colors. Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, clay loam or rarely clay with lenses of contrasting texture in most pedons. This horizon in some pedons may be very firm and\ndense in place, suggesting semiconsolidation during deposition.\nA 2C or 2Cd horizon, where present, has colors same as the C or Cd horizons and is saprolite from highly weathered acid crystalline rock that crushes to sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Mica flakes are few to many."

Cowarts, Marvyn, Springhill and Vaucluse soils all are derived from coastal plain marine sediments. In addition\nCowarts, Durham, Marvyn and Springhill soils do not have brittle features in their solum and Vaucluse soils have Bt horizons that range to 2.5YR hue. Altavista soils have mixed mineralogy and occur on stream terraces. Appling, Helena and Wedowee soils are in a clayey family. In addition Appling and Wedowee soils are well drained. Colfax soils are somewhat poorly drained."

The small extent does not warrant a subgroup proposal.\nLab data generated by the University of Georgia Soil Characterization Laboratory, pedon S88GA217-005 is the basis for determination of clay activity.\nRevised 3/97:RLV"
