  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Depth to the horizons with brittle properties is 20 to 36 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed. Some pedons may contain few to common flakes of mica throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Mottles in shades of red, brown and yellow are none to many.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Mottles in shades of red, brown and yellow are common or many or some horizons are mottled in the same colors. Gray mottles occur in the lower Btx horizon. Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay loam. Brittleness is 10 to 55 percent, but is at least 40 percent in some part of the Btx horizon. Plinthite is 0 to 4 percent.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has color same as the Btx horizons or is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray. Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8 or it may be mottled in the same colors. Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, clay loam or rarely clay with lenses of contrasting texture in most pedons. This horizon in some pedons may be very firm and\ndense in place, suggesting semiconsolidation during deposition.\nA 2C or 2Cd horizon, where present, has colors same as the C or Cd horizons and is saprolite from highly weathered acid crystalline rock that crushes to sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Mica flakes are few to many."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cowarts, Marvyn, Springhill and Vaucluse series in the same family and the Altavista, Appling, Colfax, Durham, Helena and Wedowee series in closely related families. Cowarts, Marvyn, Springhill and Vaucluse soils all are derived from coastal plain marine sediments. In addition\nCowarts, Durham, Marvyn and Springhill soils do not have brittle features in their solum and Vaucluse soils have Bt horizons that range to 2.5YR hue. Altavista soils have mixed mineralogy and occur on stream terraces. Appling, Helena and Wedowee soils are in a clayey family. In addition Appling and Wedowee soils are well drained. Colfax soils are somewhat poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Alcovy soils are on nearly level to gently sloping Piedmont uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Elevation ranges from 650 to 1,000 feet. The soil formed in old valley fill material and in the underlying residuum from crystalline rock on uplands of the Piedmont province. The mean annual temperature is about 60 to 67 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 to 53 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Appling, Durham, Helena and Wedowee series there are the Ashlar, Cecil, Madison and Pacolet series. Ashlar soils are in a coarse-loamy family. Cecil, Madison and Pacolet soils have a red Bt horizon and are in a clayey family. In addition, Madison soils contain more mica."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Slow runoff. Permeability is moderately rapid in the surface and subsurface layers and slow in the Btx horizons, resulting in a perched water table during the wet seasons."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to approximately 11 inches (Ap and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 11 to 45 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btx1, Btx2 and Btx3 horizons).\nKandic horizon - the zone from approximately 11 to 45 inches with low activity clay in most of the horizon ( Bt1, Bt2, Btx1, Btx2, and Btx3 horizons).\nThe Btx horizons with 40 to 60 percent brittleness would key out as a member of the Fragic Kanhapludults if that subgroup were available. The small extent does not warrant a subgroup proposal.\nLab data generated by the University of Georgia Soil Characterization Laboratory, pedon S88GA217-005 is the basis for determination of clay activity.\nRevised 3/97:RLV\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nGA0096 ALCOVY      2- 10   60- 67  220-240  45- 53   650-1000\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nGA0096 NONE          2.0-3.0  PERCHED  JAN-MAR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nGA0096  0-11  SL LS                   0-  5  85- 90  2-15   3- 10\nGA0096  0-11  COSL LCOS               0-  5  75- 90  2-10   2-  5\nGA0096 11-23  SL SCL CL               0-  5  80- 95 15-35   3-  6\nGA0096 23-45  SCL SC CL               0-  5  90-100 25-50   4-  8\nGA0096 45-80  SL SCL SC               0-  5  85-100 15-40   3-  6\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
