  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arthur series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess and underlying stratified sandy eolian material.  Arthur soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters.",
