  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section has a weighted average clay content of 35 to 45 percent.  The reaction of the control section ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.  Iron-manganese masses and concretions range from none to few throughout. Although redoximorphic features are present, aquic conditions do not occur within about 24 inches of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  Redox depletions range from few to common.  Redox concentrations in shades of brown, red, or yellow range from few to common in most subhorizons below a depth of 20 inches.  The texture ranges from clay loam to clay and typically is clay loam or silty clay loam in the upper part and silty clay or clay below a depth of 36 inches.  The reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.  Pressure faces range from none to few.  Pressure faces are mainly in silty clay or clay subhorizons.  Crystals of gypsum and very fine or fine masses of barite range from none to common."

The soils formed in recent sediments from adjacent uplands of the Texas Claypan (87A) and Blackland Prairie (86A) MLRAs.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches and mean annual temperature is 64 or 65 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 248 to 250.  The elevation ranges from 350 to 400 feet above sea level.  Annual Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 64 to 66."

This soil floods two to five times during most years and the duration of flooding is very brief or brief, typically from one to three days.  It appears a water table and/or saturation occurs at a depth of 24 to 40 inches (aquic conditions) mainly during the period from December to April."
