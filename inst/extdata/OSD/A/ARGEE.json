Bullbasin soils contain 5 to 25 percent rock fragments dominantly gravel size and have bedrock at 100 to 150. Lespate soils have Bk horizon and overlies hard bedrock.  Secondset soils are moderately deep over hard bedrock.  Strickland soils have cambic horizons that have evidence of secondary clay movement and lack channers and have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Winevada soils have a lithic contact that range from 50 to 100 cm and contain 18 to 27 percent clay and have mollic epipedon that range from 40 to 76 cm thick."
