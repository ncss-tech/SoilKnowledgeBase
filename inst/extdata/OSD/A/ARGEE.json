  "OVERVIEW": "Argee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone.  Argee soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Bullbasin soils contain 5 to 25 percent rock fragments dominantly gravel size and have bedrock at 100 to 150. Lespate soils have Bk horizon and overlies hard bedrock.  Secondset soils are moderately deep over hard bedrock.  Strickland soils have cambic horizons that have evidence of secondary clay movement and lack channers and have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Winevada soils have a lithic contact that range from 50 to 100 cm and contain 18 to 27 percent clay and have mollic epipedon that range from 40 to 76 cm thick."
