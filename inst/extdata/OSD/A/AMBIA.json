Horizons having values, moist, of less than 4 are\nless than 7 inches thick.  Mottles are few or common, fine or\nmedium, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown\n(10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), or\ndark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4, 4/4).  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe IIAbg horizons are dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2) or grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2) with common fine or medium\nmottles of dark gray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4, 3/4), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6).

Gladewater, Leeper, and Tuscumbia soils have no erratic distribution of organic matter.  Gladewater soils are grayer than Ambia soils.  Tuscumbia soils have mixed mineralogy.  Houlka, Una, and Urbo soils have an acid control section.  Una and Urbo soils have mixed mineralogy and have no\nvertic properties.  Iberia and Roxton soils have a mollic\nepipedon.  Ijam soils are saturated 3 to 6 months each year, are grayer, and are neutral through strongly alkaline throughout.  Lacroix soils have no vertic properties."
