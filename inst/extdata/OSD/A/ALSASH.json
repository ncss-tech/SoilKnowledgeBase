These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 20 percent pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 5 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 10 percent. One or more horizons in the top 30 inches of the profile, including the surface horizon in all cases, has less than 75 percent base saturation by sum of bases. The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay and has less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Depth to the duric layer (3Bkq) is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. Texture are ashy fine sandy loam, ashy very fine sandy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Chroma is 3 or 4 dry. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 3Bkq horizons have value of 6 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist. Chroma is 2 to 4 dry and 3 to 4 moist. There is 20 to 50 percent durinodes and cicada casts. Texture is gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly silt loam. Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Alsash soils occur at elevations of 2,000 to 2,800 feet and are on ridges, side slopes and toe slopes of uplands. These soils formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash, and pumice over older loess. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The semiarid climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average January temperature is 27 degrees F., average July temperature is 71 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost- free season is 130 to 180 days."

Nemire and Kester soils are in drainageways. Deercut soils are coarse-loamy and have an indurated duripan at 20 to 40 inches. Kester soils are moderately deep to basalt. Nemire soils do not have a duric layer within the soil profile and are ashy. Toler soils are moderately deep to basalt."
