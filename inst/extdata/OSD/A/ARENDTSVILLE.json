  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to fanglomerate or breccia bedrock ranges from 5 to 20 feet.  Rock fragments of rounded quartzite, sandstone or aporhyolite are most common.  They are usually less than 3 inches in size but range up to 12 inches or more.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the solum and from 15 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction in the upper solum ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid unless limed and in the lower solum ranges from extremely through strongly acid when unlimed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures range from silt loam to sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Textures are loam, clay loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction with 18 to 30 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent silt.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R,  value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Allegheny, Clymer, Edgemont, Edneyville, Frankstown, Meadowville, Quakertown, Rayne, and Shelocta soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the B horizon. Allenwood soils have rock fragments dominated by sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Aura soils have 7.5YR or 10YR hues in the upper part of the B horizon.  Bedington soils have rock fragments of gray or olive shale and angular fragments of siltstone, sandstone or quartz.  Birdsboro soils have rock fragments of red sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Chester soils have evident mica especially in the lower part of the solum.  Chetwynd soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the solum.  Collington and Freehold soils have moderate amounts of glouconite.  Eubanks soils have rock fragments of angular quartz and weathered granodiorite.  Murrill soils have sola more than 72 inches thick.  Nixon soils have rock fragments dominated by quartzite cobbles with some red shale.  Shouns soils have sola more than 60 inches thick and rock fragments dominated by sandstone, siltstone, and shale.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gentle sloping to steep dissected uplands.  Slopes are mainly 5 to 20 percent with an extreme range of about 2 to 40 percent.  Arendtsville soils formed in materials weathered from a fanglomerate of quartzite, sandstone, aporhyolite, and other rocks held together in a red sandy matrix.  The climate is humid and temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 44 inches; mean annual temperature ranges 50 to 55 degrees F.; and the frost free season ranges from 165 to 175 days."
