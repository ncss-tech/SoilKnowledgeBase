    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in related families are the Barry, Brookston, Millgrove, Navunon, Radioville, Rensselaer, Tallmadge, and Westland series. All of these series have a CEC to clay ratio of 0.6 or more, and have a superactive cation-exchange activity class. In addition, Barry, Millgrove, Rensselaer, and Westland soils have less than 22 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Brookston and Radioville soils have, in the middle part of the series control section, less than 60 percent of the sand fraction dominated by medium or coarser sand. Navunon soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Tallmadge soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches)."
