  "OVERVIEW": "The Acker series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hill slopes, broad ridgetops, and mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary and rhyolitic tuff rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary and rhyolitic tuff rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist to wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.   The mean annual precipitation is typically 35 to 60 inches but may range to 100 inches in high winter rainfall interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The frost free period is 100 to 200 days."

(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nPale feature - the zone from 0 to 60 inches having no decrease in clay by 20 percent or more.\nParticle-size control section - from 17 to 37 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nBase saturation is assumed to be less than 35 percent at 67 inches; assumption is based on data from associated series."
