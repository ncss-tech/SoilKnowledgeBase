  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Acker soils are on hill slopes, broad ridgetops, and mountain side slopes.  Elevations are 400 to 4,000 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary and rhyolitic tuff rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist to wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.   The mean annual precipitation is typically 35 to 60 inches but may range to 100 inches in high winter rainfall interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The frost free period is 100 to 200 days."

Norling and Vena soils are moderately deep.  Zing soils are fine and are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained.  All of these soils occur on broad ridgetops, side slopes, or foot slopes of mountains."

It also reflects a change in classification from Haploxerults to Palexerults.\nCEC activity class superactive added 1/2000, competing series not updated at that time.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 60 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nPale feature - the zone from 0 to 60 inches having no decrease in clay by 20 percent or more.\nParticle-size control section - from 17 to 37 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nBase saturation is assumed to be less than 35 percent at 67 inches; assumption is based on data from associated series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
