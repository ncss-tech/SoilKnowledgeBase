  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is 60 inches or more.  Typically the profiles do not have rock fragments, but the lower horizons may have as much as 5 percent in some pedons.  These fragments are less than 5 mm in diameter.  Base saturation by sum of cations is 50 to 60 percent in the part of the Bt horizon with the lowest base saturation.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the upper part to slightly acid or neutral in the lower part.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon and E part of the E&Bt horizon have value 4 to 6 and chroma 2 to 4.  These horizons have high chroma mottles adjacent to the Bt horizon in some pedons.  The A and E horizons are fine sand, very fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon and Bt part of the E&Bt horizon have hue of 10YR to 5YR and value and chroma of 3 to 5.  The combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 6 to 24 inches.  It typically is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and less commonly loam or sandy clay loam in subhorizons of some pedons.  The Bt has B/A clay ratios that range from 1.5 to 6.0 and are commonly near the higher part of the range.  It has 6 to 18 percent clay and 15 to 40 percent fine sand and coarser.  It has few to many clay bridges between sand grains or few to many, faint or distinct clay films.  It has individual Bt subhorizons that coalesce in some pedons.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and is fine sand or very fine sand."

Chetek soils have 2C horizons of sand and gravel beginning at depths ranging from 12 to 24 inches and do not have E&Bt horizons.  Hodenpyl soils have dominantly medium sands throughout the control section.  Montcalm soils typically have sandy loam and sandy clay loam Bt horizons."

They formed in sandy and coarse-loamy glacial outwash or lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsin Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches."

The excessively drained Zimmerman soils are sandy and are on more undulating landscapes.  The somewhat poorly drained Lino and Soderville soils are on less sloping, lower lying areas and have water tables at higher depths.  The very poorly drained Isanti soils are in depressions."
