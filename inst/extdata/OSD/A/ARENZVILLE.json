  "OVERVIEW": "The Arenzville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep or deep to a buried soil formed in mostly light-colored, relatively recent (post-settlement), mostly silty alluvium overlying buried soils with dark colored A horizons.  These soils are on flood plains and upland drainageways.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
