  "OVERVIEW": "The Agua series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in recent stream alluvium from mixed sources. Agua soils are on flood plains, and alluvial fans. They have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F (17 degrees C).",
