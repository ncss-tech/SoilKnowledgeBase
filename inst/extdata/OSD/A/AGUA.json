Slopes are dominantly 0 to 1 percent but range to 3 percent. These soils formed in recent stream alluvium from mixed sources. The climate is arid and semi-arid continental. The mean annual temperature ranges from 56 to 69 degrees F (13.3 to 21.0 degrees C) and the average annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 12 inches (177 to 305 mm). The frost-free season is 165 to 275 days."
