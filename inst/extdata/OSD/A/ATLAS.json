  "OVERVIEW": "The Atlas series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, soils at the upper ends of incised drainageways and on convex side slopes on till plains. The modern soil is largely super-imposed on a Sangamon paleosol. Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Elco and Keller soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying till that contains a paleosol, with or without a layer of pedisediment in between. In addition, Keller soils have a mollic epipedon. Hickory soils average more than 15 percent sand in the particle-size control section, formed in Illinoian till, and are downslope from Atlas soils.

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low or moderately low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers per second) in the slowest layers.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 33 cm (13 inches), (Ap and BE horizons);\nAlbic horizon - the zone from a depth of 18 to 33 cm (7 to 13 inches), (BE horizons);\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 33 to 155 cm (13 to 61 inches), (2Btg1, 2Btg2, 2Btg3, 2Btg4 horizons);\nEpisaturation - redox depletions in those horizons above argillic horizon and paleosol.\nAquic moisture regime - redox features in all layers between lower boundary of Ap and 41 cm (16 inches), and less than 2 chroma matrix within top 13 cm (5 inches) of argillic;\nMesic temperature regime.\nThe concept of the Atlas series is that of soils formed in Illinoian till or accretion gley that contains a strongly developed Sangamon paleosol. There is a minor occurrence of Atlas soils in Illinois, generally in the area west of the Illinois River, that have a paleosol formed in Pre-Illinoian till. Those soils are similar to the Atlas soils and are included with them. The variability of the properties in the Atlas series is related to the geologic truncation of the paleosol before it was buried by loess, and to the extent of modern soil forming processes on the old materials. Many of the properties of the Btg horizon are believed to be inherited from the paleosol. Calcium and other bases have been replenished in many pedons after burial by loess by seepage water from upslope or from the mantling material. The brighter colors allowed in the 2BC or 2C horizons of some pedons represent soils that extend through the gray paleosol into the less weathered or unweathered till below. It is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the modern solum from those of the paleosol in many pedons. Some pedons contain buried horizons of the paleosol beneath the modern solum.\nDescribed from a core taken from near the previous OSD type location."
