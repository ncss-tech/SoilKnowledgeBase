They formed in mixed material derived from soft limestone, calcareous shale and sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.   These soils receive about 75 percent of their moisture as summer showers between May and September.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 140 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,200 feet."
