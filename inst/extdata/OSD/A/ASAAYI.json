  "OVERVIEW": "The Asaayi series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from sandstone and shale.  Asaayi soils are on cuestas and hills and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
