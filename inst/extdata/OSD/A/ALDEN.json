  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 19 to 48 inches. Depth to free carbonates is greater than 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. Some pedons do not have a mucky surface. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral. Some undisturbed areas have an 0 horizon 2 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y or 5GY, or is neutral with value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Redoximorphic concentrations are few to many and distinct or prominent. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from very fine sandy loam or silt loam to silty clay loam. Structure is subangular blocky, which may be within coarse or very coarse prisms, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have an Eg horizon with platy structure, color value of 5 or 7 and chroma of 0 or 1. Texture is similar to the Bg horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y,or neutral, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 3. Redoximorphic features are few to many and faint to prominent. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. It is massive or has weak plate-like divisions. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline to a depth of 40 inches, and ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline at depths greater than 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Lyons series is in the same family. Lyons soils have free carbonates at depths less than 40 inches.\nThe Atherton, Birdsall, and Canandaigua soils are members of related families. Atherton soils have dominant chroma of more than 2 within a depth of 30 inches. Birdsall soils have a coarse-silty particle size control section and Canandaigua soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Alden soils are nearly level and are in depressions on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy till with an 18 to 40 inch thick mantle of local depositional material. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F; mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 48 inches; and mean annual frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days."

Alton, Chenango, and Howard soils are on nearby outwash terraces. Wayland soils are in nearby valley flood plains. Chippewa soils are in depressions."

Some areas are cleared and are largely used for pasture. Some abandoned cleared areas are reverting back to hydrophytic shrubs and herbaceous plants."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Original classification placed Alden in the great group of Haplaquepts. Because of changes in the 5th edition to `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Endoaquepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified. This description restricts the series to upland areas with the soil developed wholly or partly in loamy local alluvium underlain by till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1) Mollic Epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (A horizon)\n2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 30 inches (Bg horizons)\n3) Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime, and low chroma matrix with redoximorphic features within a depth of 20 inches (Bg horizon)\nSoil Interpretation Record No.: NY0100, NY0101\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
