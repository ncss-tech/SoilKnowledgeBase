  "OVERVIEW": "The Alden series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in depressions and low areas on upland till Plains. They formed in a silty local depositional mantle overlying till. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the surface layer and low to moderately high in the subsoil and substratum.The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. Some pedons do not have a mucky surface. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral. Some undisturbed areas have an 0 horizon 2 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y or 5GY, or is neutral with value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Redoximorphic concentrations are few to many and distinct or prominent. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from very fine sandy loam or silt loam to silty clay loam. Structure is subangular blocky, which may be within coarse or very coarse prisms, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have an Eg horizon with platy structure, color value of 5 or 7 and chroma of 0 or 1. Texture is similar to the Bg horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y,or neutral, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 3. Redoximorphic features are few to many and faint to prominent. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. It is massive or has weak plate-like divisions. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline to a depth of 40 inches, and ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline at depths greater than 40 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Original classification placed Alden in the great group of Haplaquepts. Because of changes in the 5th edition to `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Endoaquepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified. This description restricts the series to upland areas with the soil developed wholly or partly in loamy local alluvium underlain by till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1) Mollic Epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (A horizon)\n2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 30 inches (Bg horizons)\n3) Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime, and low chroma matrix with redoximorphic features within a depth of 20 inches (Bg horizon)\nSoil Interpretation Record No.: NY0100, NY0101\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
