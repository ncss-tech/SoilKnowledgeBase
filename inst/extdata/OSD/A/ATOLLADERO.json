  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Atolladero soils occur near tidal marshes along the coast at elevations close to sea level on the Humid Coastal Plains MLRA.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in regolith consisting of sand-size shell fragments, quartz grains and sub rounded volcanic fragments.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 70 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 78 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Catano, Guanajibo, and Joyuda series.  The excessively drained Catano soils are on higher adjacent positions. The well drained Guanajibo soils are on higher positions, have more clay in the subsoil, and have the presence of indurated plinthite.  The very poorly drained Joyuda soils are on slightly lower tidal marsh positions and are Histosols."
