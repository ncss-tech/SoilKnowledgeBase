  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F.  These soils usually are dry for 6 months or more during most years, mainly during the spring, summer and autumn.  The A1 horizon has 0.10 to 0.30 percent organic matter.  The soil profile except for the Cca horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam modified by 50 to 80 percent gravel.  The gravel is less than 2 inches in diameter, averageing about 3/4 inch and is rounded or subrounded.  Lime mottles, stains, and soft nodules occur in any horizon below the A1 horizon, and are medium or coarse.  pH ranges from 8.6 to 9.6 except in the Ccs horizon where pH ranges from 7.0 to 8.4.  The Ccs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is 3 to 10 inches below the surface and is 24 to 40 inches thick.  The gypsum is disseminated or segregated and is in the form of very fine crystals or coarse soft nodules."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arrolime soils are on strongly dissected old alluvial fans with smooth to slightly convex, gently sloping (2 to 4 percent gradient) side slopes.  These soils formed in highly gypsiferous alluvium derived mainly from gypsum with some admixture from limestone, sandstone, and other sedimentary rocks.  The climate is arid, having a mean annual precipitation of 4 to 6 inches.  The temperatures are hot, having a mean annual precipitation of about 63 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 43 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Arrolime soils were formerly classified as Gypsic Solonchak soils. It latter was classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Leptic Haplogypsids. The classification was again revised in March of 2003 recognizing the calcic horizon above the gypsic and adding the CEC activity class using the second edition to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series were not checked at that time. -ET\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 3/2003.
