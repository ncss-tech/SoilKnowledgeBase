The soils formed in residuum derived from coarse grained tuffs, rhyolite, breccia, granite and related rocks, with minor amounts of alluvium and colluvium  derived from mixed rock sources in some pedons.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,178 to 2,135 meters.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C, the mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 200 mm and the frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."
