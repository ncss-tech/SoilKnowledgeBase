  "OVERVIEW": "The Advokay series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from coarse grained tuff, rhyolite, granitic and related rocks.  Advokay soils are on mountain slopes, hills and pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
