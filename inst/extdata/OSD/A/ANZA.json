  "OVERVIEW": "The Anza series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks. Anza soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 320 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
