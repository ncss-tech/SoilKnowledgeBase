  "OVERVIEW": "The Aninto series consists of well drained, very deep soils that formed in alluvium from mica schist, quartzite, and welded tuff.  They are on fan terraces, toe slopes, and terrace sideslopes.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
