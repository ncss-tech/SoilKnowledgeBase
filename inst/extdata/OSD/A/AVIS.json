  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the volcanic ash mantle over the pyroclastic sands is about 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to fractured lava flow rock is 60 to 80 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to November 10 and exceeds 47 degrees F from June 1 to October 20.   The soil is dry in the 12 to 48 inches control section from mid-July to mid-October.  It is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Base saturation ranges from 20 to 50 percent throughout the soil.  The NaF pH ranges from 10.9 in the surface to 9.9 at depths of 40 to 72 inches.  Lava flow rock fragments consisting of cobbles, gravel and stones occur throughout the soil.  They make up 35 to 70 percent of the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Stones and cobbles cover 5 to 50 percent of the soil surface.  In some pedons there is very weak silica cementation of the upper few inches of the 2C horizon and strata of 1/4 to 2 inches thick deposit of finer volcanic ash between pyroclastic sand strata.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 5/2, 4/3, 4/4.  Reaction is neutral to medium acid.  Texture is stony sandy loam or very stony sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 7.5YR 5/2, 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4.  It is very gravelly loamy fine sand, very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.  Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe 2C horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/4, 4/3, or 4/4.  Texture is very gravelly loamy fine sand, very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.  Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deetz, Delaney, Oosen, Plutos and Shasta series in other families.  All these soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  In addition, Deetz and Delaney soils have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Plutos soils have a mesic soil temperature regime and are 20 to 40 inches deep to hard basalt.  Shasta soils have an umbric epipedon ashy control section and a mesic soil temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Avis soils are on slopes of volcanic mountainous peaks at elevations of 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.   The soils formed in pyroclastic ashy materials deposited over and in highly fractured and broken lava flow rock.  Barren lava flows are common and large boulders are throughout the geographic area and are in the soil and are partially exposed at the surface.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm nearly dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  Snowfall is 24 to 48 inches and covers the high elevation lands from early December until early April in most years.  Mean January temperature is 23 to 28 degrees F; mean July temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 35 to 60 days."

Iller and Sheld soils have umbric epipedons and medial over loamy-skeletal and medial-skeletal control sections respectively.  Orset soils have base saturation of greater than 60 percent and a coarse-loamy control section."
