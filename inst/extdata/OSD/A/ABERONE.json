    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches. Depth to the 2Bk horizon is 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 63 to 72 degrees F. Rock fragments in the particle size control section average from 40 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobble.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma is 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. In some areas on overwash of gravel may occur and texture is gravelly sandy loam with 15 to 25 percent gravel. Typically, gravel content is less than 5 percent in this horizon. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Coarse fragments are typically absent but may range to 20 percent gravel in some pedons. It is  sandy loam,  fine sandy loam or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, 10 to 40 percent silt, and 52 to 75 percent sand with over 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 6 through 8, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 5. Rock fragments range from 30 to 75 percent gravel and 15 to 35 percent cobble. Texture is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, 10 to 40 percent silt, and 51 to 75 percent sand with over 35 percent being fine sand or coarser. Calcium carbonate equivalent of the 20mm or less fraction ranges from 40 to 70 percent."
