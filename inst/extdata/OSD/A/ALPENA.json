  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated the depths in the following paragraph are measured from the mineral soil surface.) The solum ranges from about 4 to 10 inches in thickness.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 4 to 30 inches. Rock fragments are of limestone origin. The gravel content ranges from 10 to 75 percent in the solum and from 35 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Total rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 75 percent in the solum and from 35 to 85 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The A horizons are sandy loam, loam,loamy sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of these textures.  Reaction of the A1 and A2 horizons is neutral or slightly alkaline. Upon mixing, the upper 7 inches has a chroma that is less than 3.5 moist.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons that range up to 5 inches thick. They have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction of the Bw horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is the gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs of sand or coarse sand or the stratified very gravelly sand and sand or coarse sand. Reactkion is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alpena soils are on glacial lake beaches, kames, outwash plains, eskers, and deltas.  Slope gradients typically average between 0 and 18 percent and range from 0 to about 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges form 28 to 31 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F."

East Lake, Kiva, and Mancelona are somewhat excessively drained and well drained soils on nearby kames, outwash plains and eskers.  Kalkaska and Rubicon soils have spodic horizons and are on the uplands near areas of Alpena soils.  The well drained Longrie and somewhat poorly drained Sundell soils, which are underlain by limestone bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches, and are associated with Alpena soils in some areas."
