  "OVERVIEW": "The Alpena series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in loamy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits on glacial lake beaches, kames, eskers, deltas, and outwash plains.  These soils have very rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated the depths in the following paragraph are measured from the mineral soil surface.) The solum ranges from about 4 to 10 inches in thickness.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 4 to 30 inches. Rock fragments are of limestone origin. The gravel content ranges from 10 to 75 percent in the solum and from 35 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Total rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 75 percent in the solum and from 35 to 85 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The A horizons are sandy loam, loam,loamy sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of these textures.  Reaction of the A1 and A2 horizons is neutral or slightly alkaline. Upon mixing, the upper 7 inches has a chroma that is less than 3.5 moist.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons that range up to 5 inches thick. They have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction of the Bw horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is the gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs of sand or coarse sand or the stratified very gravelly sand and sand or coarse sand. Reactkion is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Kalkaska and Rubicon soils have spodic horizons and are on the uplands near areas of Alpena soils.
