  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 to 62 F.  The mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures are about 67 and 54 F. respectively.  Soil between depths of about 4 to 12 inches usually is moist in some part shortly after the first of November and stays moist until sometime in May and is dry all the rest of the year.  The soil is slightly to strongly effervescent throughout, but the lime is less than 15 percent.\nThe A horizon is gray, dark gray, or very dark gray in 10YR hue.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  The same textural limits apply to the 10 to 40 inches section.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 4 percent to a depth of more than 20 inches and decreases regularly with increasing depth.\nThe C horizon is pale brown, brown, grayish brown, dark grayish brown, gray or light gray in 10YR hue.  Distinct or prominent mottles are present in some pedons.  This horizon is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and has common stratification."

Fontana, Linne, and San Benito soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Gazos soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Salinas soils are noncalcareous in the upper part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Agueda soils are on nearly level to moderately steep slopes and are at elevations of 50 to 1000 feet.  They formed in alluvium from calcareous sedimentary rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with cool to warm rainless summers with some fog, and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The average January temperature is about 50 F; average July temperature is 62 to 64 F; mean annual temperature is 57 to 60 F.  the average frost-free season is 230 to 300 days."

Botella soils have argillic horizons and are noncalcareous.  Elder soils are coarse-loamy and noncalcareous.  Santa Lucia soils have 35 percent rock fragments and have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
