  "OVERVIEW": "The Alakai series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic material overlaying clay weathered from basalt. Alakai soils are in swamps located on high mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 7,112 millimeters (280 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. (56 degrees F.)",
