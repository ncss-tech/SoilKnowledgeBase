    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Aquariusmine soils are on shoulders, backslopes, and footslopes in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from metasedimentary rock over residuum weathered from marble. Elevation is 400 to 750 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 800 to 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 220 to 265 days."

Beybek is found on upper portions of the hillslope and are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Mercercave and Tiger Creek are mesic soils, occupying cooler aspects and higher elevations. Mercercave is clayey-skeletal. Tiger Creek has redder hues throughout the argillic (2.5YR-10R). Millvilla, Wardsferry, Priestgrade, Moccasinhill, and Sanguinetti develop from schist, phyllite and other metasedimentary rocks other than marble. Millvilla (moderately deep) and Wardsferry (deep) have a paralithic contact. Priestgrade, Moccasinhill, and Sanguinetti are loamy-skeletal."
