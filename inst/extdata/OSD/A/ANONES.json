  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Anones series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes of strongly dissected uplands.  They formed in material that weathered from volcanic rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 and 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In the lower horizons, saprolite composes up to 60 percent of the horizon.  Texture is loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6; or there is no dominant color and it is variegated in shades of red, yellow, brown, gray, and white.  Texture is loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of saprolite that is easily rippable by machinery."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Anones soils are on side slopes of strongly dissected uplands.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  They formed in material that consists of medium-textured residuum which derived from very highly weathered basic volcanic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 85 to 95 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 74 to 76 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Caguabo, Consumo, Humatas, and Mucara series.  All of these soils are on similar positions as Anones soils.   Caguabo soils are shallow to bedrock and have less clay in the control section.  Consumo soils have argillic horizons and mixed mineralogy.  Humatas soils are very deep, have argillic horizons, have parasesquic mineralogy, and have more clay in the control section.  Mucara soils have yellowier subsoils, have mixed mineralogy, and have less clay in the control section."
