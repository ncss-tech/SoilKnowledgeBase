  "OVERVIEW": "The Aaberg series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils formed in fine textured sediments weathered from underlying clay shale. Aaberg soils are on upland hills and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 39 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the control section.  The solum is calcareous in some pedons. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size control section is typically clay but averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 15 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 45 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the major part of the control section and are mainly 0 to 10 inches in diameter.  In some pedons subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur, but a major part of the solum and C horizons above the bedrock has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Mottling ranges from none to few faint mottles.  These soils crack widely on drying and have a high shrink-swell potential.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nA Ck horizon is present in some pedons but is absent or discontinuous in others.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline."

The soil formed in fine textured, noncalcareous or weakly calcareous parent sediments weathered from underlying clay shale beds.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual air temperature is 37 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 57 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 8,200 to 8,600 feet."
