  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the  Dragonwash (T CA), Jean (NV), Kokan (NM), and Pipecan (T CA) series. Dragonwash soils are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 millimeters) within the particle size control section. Jean soils have a shallow Bw horizon and have textures in the upper control section of loamy sand or loamy fine sand with less than 15 percent rock fragments. Kokan soils occur within the Chihuahuan Desert (MLRA 42) and are moist for short periods in some part mainly in July, August, and early September and are dry the rest of the year. Pipecan soils are usually dry, moist following winter storms and only intermittingly moist near the soil surface following occasional summer convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arizo soils are on recent alluvial fans, inset fans, fan aprons, fan skirts, stream terraces, floodplains of intermittent streams and channels. These soils form in mixed alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are 225 to 1,405 meters (750 to 4,600 feet). The climate is arid or semiarid with mild winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 250 millimeters (2 to 10 inches) and may range to 330 millimeters (13 inches) in Arizona where temperatures are 19 to 21 degrees C. (67 to 70 degrees F.); mean annual temperature is 14 to 21 degrees C. (57 to 70 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 180 to 340 days."
