  "OVERVIEW": "The Arizo series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Arizo soils are on recent alluvial fans, inset fans, fan apron, fan skirts, stream terraces, floodplains of intermittent streams and channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 millimeters (7 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (62 degrees F.).",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the  Dragonwash (T CA), Jean (NV), Kokan (NM), and Pipecan (T CA) series. Dragonwash soils are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 millimeters) within the particle size control section. Jean soils have a shallow Bw horizon and have textures in the upper control section of loamy sand or loamy fine sand with less than 15 percent rock fragments. Kokan soils occur within the Chihuahuan Desert (MLRA 42) and are moist for short periods in some part mainly in July, August, and early September and are dry the rest of the year. Pipecan soils are usually dry, moist following winter storms and only intermittingly moist near the soil surface following occasional summer convection storms."
