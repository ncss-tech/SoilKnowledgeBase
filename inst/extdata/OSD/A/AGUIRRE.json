  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. JLL; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Aguirre series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils in depressions and on valley floors of the Semiarid Coastal Plain MLRA.  They formed in clayey marine sediments and material derived from limestone and igneous rock.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",
