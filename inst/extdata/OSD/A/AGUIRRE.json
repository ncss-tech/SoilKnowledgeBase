Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the A horizons, and moderately alkaline in the Bss horizons.  The soil is calcareous throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay.\nThe upper part of the Bss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay.\nThe lower part of the Bss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 through 4; or there is no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of brown and gray.  Concretions and/or soft masses of iron-manganese ranges from none to common."

The somewhat poorly drained Cartagena soils are on higher positions, have less clay in the control section, and have mixed mineralogy.  The somewhat poorly drained Fe soils are on slightly higher positions and have less clay in the control section.  The moderately well drained Fraternidad soils are on higher positions, have less clay in the subsoil, and do not have an exchangeable sodium percentage of 15 or more (SAR of 13 or more).  The somewhat poorly drained Guanica soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have gypsum accumulation in the subsoil."
