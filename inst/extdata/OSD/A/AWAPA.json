  "OVERVIEW": "The Awapa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from igneous rock.  Awapa soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 25 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
