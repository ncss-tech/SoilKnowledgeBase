Birdcanyon, Bluepoint, Cajon, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Moapa, Morongo, Toquop, and Yander soils are located in the Mohave Desert and receive precipitation mainly in the winter.  Brazito, Copio, Pintura soils have less than 10 percent clay plus silt in the control section. Copia soils are noneffervescent throughout. Hembrillo soils have gypsum in the control section. Yturbide soils have 15 to 35 percent fragments in the control section."
