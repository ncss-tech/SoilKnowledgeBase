    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in calcareous and gypsiferous alluvium.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid continental.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches with over one-half of the total falling in June through September.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F. to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 180 to 220 days."
