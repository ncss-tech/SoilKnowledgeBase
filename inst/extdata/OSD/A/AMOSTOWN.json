  "STATES": "MA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Amostown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial outwash overlying lacustrine sediments. They are nearly level to gently sloping soils on terraces, outwash plains, and deltas.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and slow to moderately slow in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 47 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 22 to 40 inches.  Content of fine gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and is absent in the C horizon.  Some pedons have a thin layer of fine gravel at the upper boundary of the 2C horizon.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the solum if not limed, and from strongly acid through moderately acid in the 2C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, with value and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It has weak granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It has weak subangular blocky or granular structure.  The Bw2 and Bw3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The Bw2 and Bw3 horizons have weak granular structure or they are massive.  The B horizons are fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt. The horizon is commonly varved or stratified.  Thin strata of very fine sand are in many pedons."

Bernardston, Broadbrook, Montauk, Nantucket, Paxton, Pollux, and Wethersfield soils lack redoximorphic concentrations in the B horizon.  No information is available at this time to differentiate the Mt. Zion series from Amostown.  Scituate soils have a sandy, dense till substratum.\nThe Brookfield, Cardigan, Charlton, Chatfield, Cheshire,  Dutchess, Lordstown, Maplecrest, Newport, Pocomtuck (tentative), Riverhead, St. Albans, Steinsburg, Valois, and Yalesville series are in related families.\nThe Cardigan, Chatfield, Lordstown, Steinsburg and Yalesville soils have bedrock within 40 inches.   Brookfield, Charlton, Cheshire, Dutchess, Maymead, Newport,  Riverhead, St. Albans, and Valois soils do not have redox concentrations in the B horizon.  Maplecrest soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the B and C horizons.  No information is available at this time to differentiate the Pocumtuck (tentative) series from Amostown."

Other soils on nearby landscapes include the somewhat excessively drained Merrimac, the well drained Agawam, the competing moderately well drained Belgrade and Eldridge soils, the moderately well drained Scio, the somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Raynham and Wareham soils, and the poorly drained Enosburg soils. Belgrade soils are coarse-silty. Eldridge soils are sandy over loamy. Scio soils are coarse-silty. Merrimac soils are sandy. Agawam soils have a sandy substratum."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 inches to a depth of 32 inches (Bw horizon).\n4. Oxyaquic feature - based upon saturation in one or more layers within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface, for one month or more per year, in 6 out of 10 years.  An apparent water table is at 18 to 36 inches December through April.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
