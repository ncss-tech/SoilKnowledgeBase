  "OVERVIEW": "The Amenson series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium derived from volcanic ash on moderately undulating uplands and mesas.  Slopes are 1 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
