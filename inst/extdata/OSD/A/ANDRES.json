  "OVERVIEW": "The Andres series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying silty till on ground moraines and lake plains. A mantle of loess or other silty material, as much as 61 cm (24 inches), overlies the outwash in many pedons. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
