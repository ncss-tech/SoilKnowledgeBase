  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is about 20 to 30 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 65 F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 F. at any time.  The soil between depths of about 8 to 25 inches is usually dry all of the time from mid-April until mid-December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.   Rock fragments are mostly cobblestones and gravel with some larger stones; fragments make up 20 to 50 percent of the A horizon and 35 to 80 percent of the B and C horizons.  The soil profile is slightly or medium acid, mostly slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown or brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4) and has 1 1/2 to 3 percent organic matter in the upper 4 to 5 inches and less than 1 percent at the bottom of the horizon.  It is massive in some or all parts or has weak structure.\nThe B2t horizon is brown to yellowish brown (7.5YR 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/4, 5/6).  It is loam or clay loam with about 25 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon has about 5 to 10 percent more clay absolute than the A horizon.   Upper horizon boundaries are gradual or there are transitional horizons or both.  The B2t horizon has weak to strong angular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe C2 horizon readily slakes in water, has considerable pores and is not regraded as a paralithic contact although it has few if any roots."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Keefers, Modjeska, Pleasanton, and Wasioja series.  Keefers soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Modjeska soils lack enough clay increase in the B horizon to have an argillic horizon.  Pleasanton and Wasioja soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon and Wasioja soils have an aridic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Agua Dulce soils are steep and are on hills at elevation of 2,200 to 2,700 feet.  They formed in weakly consolidated non-marine gravelly sediments from mixed and granitic sources.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  Average January temperature is 53 F, average July temperature is 73 F, and mean annual temperature is 63 F.  The freeze-free season is 265 to 285 days."
