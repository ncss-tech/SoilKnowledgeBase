  "OVERVIEW": "The Alama series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from the redbed formations of Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, and piedmont slopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
