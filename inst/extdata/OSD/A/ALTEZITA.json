  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Altezita series consists of very shallow to sandstone bedrock, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone over residuum weathered from sandstone.  Altezita soils are on summits of plateaus.  Slopes are 5 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.
