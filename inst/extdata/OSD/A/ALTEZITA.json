Apache and Dalerose are in the aridic ustic moisture regime and should be reclassified as Aridic Lithic Haplustolls. Bluemound, Hedville, and Sogn soils are moist in the late spring and early summer in the soil moisture control section. In addition, Hedville soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F and Sogn soils have more than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Altezita soils are on summits of plateaus.  They formed in Permian age eolian deposits derived from sandstone over residuum weathered from sandstone.  Slopes are 5 to 10 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,700 to 8,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Esquila soils are clayey, do not have a mollic epipedon, have an argillic horizon, and occur on adjacent toeslopes of plateaus.  Sabroso soils are loamy-skeletal, have an argillic horizon, and occur on steep south-facing backslopes.  Verano soils are loamy-skeletal, have an argillic horizon, and occur on steep north-facing backslopes."
