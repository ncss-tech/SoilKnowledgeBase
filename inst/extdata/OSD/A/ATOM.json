  "OVERVIEW": "The Atom series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium overlying basalt.  Atom soils are on lava plains,  terraces, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Permeability  is moderately slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and  the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
