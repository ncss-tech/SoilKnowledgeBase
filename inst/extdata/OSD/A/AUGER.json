  "OVERVIEW": "The Auger series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
