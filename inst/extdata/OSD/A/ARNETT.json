    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cobb, Decobb, Grandfield, Grandmore, Honeycreek, Hye, Lou, McKnight, Menard, and Rochelle series in the same family.  Cobb soils are moderately deep to Cr horizons of weakly cemented sandstone.  Decobb, Grandfield, and Grandmore soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick and formed in sediments containing less than 5 percent gravel.  In addition, Grandmore soils have a discontinuity of low chroma mottled clay loam and clay within 60 inches of the surface.  Honeycreek soils are deep to weathered schist bedrock.  Hye soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock.  Lou soils are moderately deep to weathered granite saprolite.  McKnight soils are deep to a Cr horizon of weathered Permian shale or sandstone.  Menard soils contain fragments of limestone and formed in Cretaceous age sediments.  Rochelle soils have horizons below 30 inches that contain 60 to 85 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles by volume."

These soils formed in loamy over gravelly alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230 days and elevation ranges from 1,000 to 2,100 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 32 to 44."

Hardeman soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and are on recent terraces lower in the landscape.  Farry and Frankirk soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar to slightly lower landscape positions.  Tilvern and Vernon soils have a fine particle-size control section and are underlain by Cr horizons of weathered shale.  These soils are on nearby lower, dissected landscape positions."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The Arnett series was included with the Miles series in the Jackson County, Oklahoma 1961 soil survey.  The series was originally established in Harmon County, Oklahoma in 1941 and later placed on the inactive soil list.  The series is being reactivated to describe soils similar to the original concept of the series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - 7 to 31 inches (Btl, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons).\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is based on lab data from Jackson County, OK.\nRange site:  Sandy Loam Prairie;  078CY110TX.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Jackson County, OK, NSSL lab No. (S97OK-065-001).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
