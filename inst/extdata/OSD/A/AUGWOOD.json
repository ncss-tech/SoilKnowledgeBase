  "REVDATE": "07/2009",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Augwood series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of sandy outwash deposits over till. These soils are on moraines and drumlins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
