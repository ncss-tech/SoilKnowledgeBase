  "OVERVIEW": "The Absher series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in till, glaciofluvial deposits, and in alluvium derived from many sources of geologic materials.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, sedimentary plains and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
