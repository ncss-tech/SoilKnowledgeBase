    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 32 inches.  Depth to hard limestone bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout.  Accumulations of soft masses of calcium carbonate range from few to many in the Bk and C horizons.  Content of pebbles range from 0 to 25 percent, by volume, throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3.   Texture is silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Soft masses and filaments of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  Presence of pressure faces range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 6. Concretions, soft masses, and filaments of calcium carbonate range from common to many.  Texture is loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of soft limestone bedrock.  It has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment."

Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  They formed of colluvium and residuum weathered from soft limestone bedrock.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 66 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F."

Descalabrado soils are on similar positions, but are shallow to volcanic bedrock.  Duey and San German soils are on similar positions, but are shallow to fractured weathered limestone bedrock.  Fraternidad and Jacana soils have vertic properties and are on lower positions. Pozo Blanco soils are on a fine-loamy family class."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 23 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nAguilita soils were correlated as Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, isohyperthermic Typic Rendolls in the 1970 Survey of the Virgin Islands of the United States. The change from Typic Rendolls to Typic Calciustolls took place when Soil Taxonomy did not allow Rendolls to have an Ustic Soil Moisture Regime.\nThe type location was moved to Puerto Rico from the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1998 and the series reclassified based on soil lab data and observations in the field.\nThe classification was updated with the 11/2004 draft to Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, isohyperthermic Aridic Calciustolls and moved to its present location because the type location selected on 1998 was updated to be an Aridic Soil Moisture Regime based on a soil moisture study in southern Puerto Rico. The concept of the Aguilita soils is on Ustic Soil Moisture Regime.\nAguilita soils are in MLRA 271.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
