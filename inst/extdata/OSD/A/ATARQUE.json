Arabrab soils are moist in April and early May due to snowmelt and can have secondary calcium carbonate. Pescado soils are inactive. Simitarq soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower argillic horizons. Valena soils formed from granite, particle size control section contain more than 50 percent sand and more than 5 percent 2 to 5 mm gravel size fragments. Verite and Uva soils have typic ustic soil moisture regimes"
