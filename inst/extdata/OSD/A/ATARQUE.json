  "OVERVIEW": "The Atarque series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian and residuum material and slope alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, and shale on mesas, hills, cuestas and knolls. Slopes are 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Arabrab soils are moist in April and early May due to snowmelt and can have secondary calcium carbonate. Pescado soils are inactive. Simitarq soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower argillic horizons. Valena soils formed from granite, particle size control section contain more than 50 percent sand and more than 5 percent 2 to 5 mm gravel size fragments.
