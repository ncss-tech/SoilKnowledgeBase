The soils formed in calcareous gravelly alluvium from mixed rocks: sedimentary, gneiss, granite, and breccia and outwash derived form granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Elevation is 7,000 to 10,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and comes mainly in the summer and fall.  The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 110 days."
