  "OVERVIEW": "The Amalia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and outwash from mixed rocks, and granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Amalia soils are on fan piedmonts and hills and have slopes of 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
