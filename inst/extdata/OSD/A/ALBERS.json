  "OVERVIEW": "The Albers series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces, concavities and broad drainageways.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Slope is 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.",
