  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Amador soils are on hills and backslopes of hills. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. On hills with slopes of less than 15 percent, there is mound and swale microrelief with Amador soils occupying the mound position. Elevation is 40 to 200 meters. These soils formed in material weathered from weakly consolidated rhyolitic tuffaceous sediments of the Valley Springs formation. The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 365 to 570 mm. Mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C; average January temperature is about 8 degrees C and average July temperature is about 25 degrees C. Frost-free period is 310 to 350 days."

Pardee soils have anargillic horizon, greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section, and occur on eroded fan remnants. Vleck soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and occur in concave footslope and toeslope positions."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nParticle Size Control Section for this pedon: 25 to 48 cm\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\t\t0 to 15cm\nCambic horizon\t\t15 to 48 cm\nParalithic contact\t48 cm\nThese soils were formerly classified as being Dystric. Subsequent lab data (Hach) indicates base saturation of more than 60 percent.  The type location was moved from Merced County to Sacramento County to better reflect the cambic horizon which is typical for these Inceptisols. The former type location lacked the cambic horizon.\nLaboratory data for Pedon ID: S04CA099-003 (taxadjunct) indicates the presence of volcanic glass throughout the control section and it is inferred that this is a common situation in the soils formed from this parent material.\nGravel size fragments slake in water.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 1987CA067003\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
