  "OVERVIEW": "The Avans series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters). Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",
