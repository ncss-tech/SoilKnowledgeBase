    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 44 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mantle of volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches thick and contains 25 to 60 percent vitric volcanic ash in the fine-earth fraction.  The ochric epipedon is 2 to 8 inches thick, but when it is 7 inches or more the solum thickness is 30 inches or more.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout. Depth to densic material is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It has 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments, including 5 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The 2Bw horizon may be absent in some pedons.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, cobbly sandy loam, or stony sandy loam.  It has 15 to 35 percent rock fragments, including 15 to 35 percent pebbles, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and stones. Moist bulk density is 1.70 to 2.00 with an RV of 1.85."

Centralpeak, Leadpoint, and Moscow soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Canteen soils are formed in granite residuum with a high content of quartz and feldspar minerals and are coarse sandy loam to loamy sand in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Waits soils are calcareous in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Moso soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days."

These soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees, and mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
