This soil most likely contains volcanic ash but the extent of the ash influence is unknown.  Lab sampling will be required to better understand the volcanic ash influence.  More work needs to be done describing roots, pores and structure.  The older 1972 Okanogan Survey described prismatic structure that may not be present."
