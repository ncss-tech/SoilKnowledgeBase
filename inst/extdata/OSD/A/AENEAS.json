The mean annual precipitation is 250 mm to 300 mm. The mean January temperature is about -6.0 degrees C.,  the mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C., and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. The frost-free season is 130 to 165 days."

This soil most likely contains volcanic ash but the extent of the ash influence is unknown.  Lab sampling will be required to better understand the volcanic ash influence.  More work needs to be done describing roots, pores and structure.  The older 1972 Okanogan Survey described prismatic structure that may not be present.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
