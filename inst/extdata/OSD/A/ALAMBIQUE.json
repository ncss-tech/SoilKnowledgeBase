Base saturation is less than 50 percent throughout the profile.  Gravel content is 0 to 35 percent throughout the profile. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 56 to 58 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is less than 9 degrees F.  The soil is moist in all parts from mid-November through June.  It is dry in some or all parts for 90 to 120 days the rest of the year, but is not dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 7/6, 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 and moist colors of 5YR 4/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 2/2.
