    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 40 inches, and the thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from l0 to 20 inches.  The solum is moderately alkaline throughout.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 3 through 5, and 2 or 3 moist, and a chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture of the Al horizon is loam or clay loam.  The structure is subangular blocky or granular and is platy in the upper two inches of some pedons.  The Al horizon is noncalcareous or weakly calcareous.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The upper part of the B2t horizon has moist is colors with values and chromas of 2 or 3.  The texture of the B2t horizon is loam or clay loam with an average clay content of less than 35 percent.  The B2t horizon is calcareous, and some pedons contain secondary carbonate concretions, threads, and soft masses in the lower part.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 5 dry or moist.  It is loam, light clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It has many threads and soft masses of secondary carbonates, and calcium carbonate equivalent is l5 to 25 percent in some part of the horizon."

Budmayr, Featherlegs, Palmer Canyon, and Sugardee soils are underlain by gravelly or cobbly materials at depths shallower than 40 inches.  Capulin, Dagflat, Hargreave, Kirtley, Rosebud, and Ryegate soils are underlain by bedrock at depths shallower than 40 inches.  Cottier, Wages and Wolf soils have sola less than 20 inches thick.  Critchell, Lavate, Noden, and Satanta soils lack calcic horizons.  Harlan soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the B2t horizon."

They have formed in alluvium from surrounding limestone-dominated landscapes.  The elevation is 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is l2 to l7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frostfree season is about l50 to l70 days."
