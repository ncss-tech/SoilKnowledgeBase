  "OVERVIEW": "The Asparas series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone.  Asparas soils are on broad, nearly level valleys and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The solum is moderately alkaline throughout.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and 2 or 3 moist, and a chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture of the A horizon is loam or clay loam.  The structure is subangular blocky or granular and is platy in the upper two inches of some pedons.  The A horizon is noncalcareous or weakly calcareous.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The upper part of the Bt horizon has moist is colors with values and chromas of 2 or 3.  The texture of the Bt horizon is loam or clay loam with an average clay content of less than 35 percent.  The Bt horizon is calcareous, and some pedons contain secondary carbonate concretions, threads, and soft masses in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 5 dry or moist.  It is loam, light clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It has many threads and soft masses of secondary carbonates, and calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 25 percent in some part of the horizon."

Wapiti soils (MLRA 67B, 69) formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits and are non-calcareous and neutral in the upper part.\nThese are the Ascalon, Bresser, Budmayr (T), Capulin, Cottier (T), Critchell (T), Dagflat, Featherlegs, Hargreave, Harlan, Kirtley, Lavate, Noden, Palmer Canyon (T), Rosebud, Ryegate, Satanta, Sugardee, Wages, and Wolf series.  Ascalon and Bresser soils are underlain by sandy loam or loamy sand and lack calcic horizons.  Budmayr, Featherlegs, Palmer Canyon, and Sugardee soils are underlain by gravelly or cobbly materials at depths shallower than 40 inches.  Capulin, Dagflat, Hargreave, Kirtley, Rosebud, and Ryegate soils are underlain by bedrock at depths shallower than 40 inches.  Cottier, Wages and Wolf soils have solum less than 20 inches thick.  Critchell, Lavate, Noden, and Satanta soils lack calcic horizons.  Harlan soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the B2t horizon."
