  "OVERVIEW": "The Aguilares series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in calcareous, loamy residuum weathered from sandstone predominantly from the Jackson Formation.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 585 mm (23 in).",

In excellent condition, mid-grasses such as four-flower trichloris, plains bristlegrass, Arizona cottontop, and pink pappusgrass dominate; guajillo, blackbrush, and coma are dominant woody plants; the major forbs are velvet bundleflower, bushsunflower, daleas, and orange zexmenia.  As retrogression occurs, woody plants, especially guajillo, blackbrush, mesquite, and cenizo increase in density.  Grasses which increase or invade are Texas bristlegrass and Hall's panicum."
