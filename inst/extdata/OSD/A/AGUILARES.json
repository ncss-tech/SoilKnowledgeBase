In excellent condition, mid-grasses such as four-flower trichloris, plains bristlegrass, Arizona cottontop, and pink pappusgrass dominate; guajillo, blackbrush, and coma are dominant woody plants; the major forbs are velvet bundleflower, bushsunflower, daleas, and orange zexmenia.  As retrogression occurs, woody plants, especially guajillo, blackbrush, mesquite, and cenizo increase in density.  Grasses which increase or invade are Texas bristlegrass and Hall's panicum."
