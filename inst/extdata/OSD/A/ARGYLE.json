Theupper part of the solum formed in 38 to 64 cm (15 to 25 inches) of loess or silty material and the lower part in late Sangamon reddish geosols formed in the underlying till.  Mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 813 to 965 mm (32 to 38 inches), frost free period range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

Greenbush and Osco soils are found on interfluve summits and slope positions above the Argyle soils.  Greenbush and Osco soils have glacial till at depths greater than 203 cm (80 inches) and Osco soils are Typic Arguidolls.  Lawson and Radford soils are located in drainageways below the Argyle soils. Myrtle soils are located on similar or slightly higher landscape positions and have glacial till at depths of 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches).  Ogle soils are located on similar positions near the heads of drainages and are Typic Arguidolls.  Pecatonica soils are located on similar positions and are Typic Hapludalfs."
