  "OVERVIEW": "The Ahoy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material derived from sandstone. Ahoy soils are on dissected, fluviomarine terraces on islands. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches (660 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
