Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 50 to 1000 feet (15 to 305 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation is 21 to 34 inches (533 to 864 mm), the mean annual temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F. (16 to 19 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 365 days."
