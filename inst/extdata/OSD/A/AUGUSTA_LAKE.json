  "OVERVIEW": "The Augusta Lake series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of eolian sediments and loamy sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are on summits and backslopes on ground moraines and till plains and on terraces and outwash plains adjacent to moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  The mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",
