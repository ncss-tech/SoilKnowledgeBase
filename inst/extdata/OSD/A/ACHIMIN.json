  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Achimin soils are on toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of foothills adjacent to basalt plateaus and in depressions on till plains.  These soils formed in loess overlying siltstone residuum.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 1,500 to 2,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 71 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."
