  "OVERVIEW": "The Achimin series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess overlying residuum from siltstone.  These soils are on toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of foothills and in depressions on till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
