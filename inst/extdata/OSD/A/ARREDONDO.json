  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Arredondo series consists of well drained soils that are rapidly permeable in the thick sandy surface and subsurface layers and moderate to very slow in the subsoil.  They formed from sandy and loamy marine sediments in central Florida on slopes ranging from 0 to 12 percent.",

Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand.  This horizon contains 5 to 15 percent silt plus clay within a depth of 10 to 40 inches below the soil surface.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.  There is a texture pickup or color from the overlying horizon.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The Bt2 horizon has the same matrix colors as the Bt1 horizon.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay."
