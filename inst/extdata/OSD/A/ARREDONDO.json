Few small weathered nodules and fragments of limestone 2 to 20 mm in size and less than 5 percent of volume are in many pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 8.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand.  This horizon contains 5 to 15 percent silt plus clay within a depth of 10 to 40 inches below the soil surface.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.  There is a texture pickup or color from the overlying horizon.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The Bt2 horizon has the same matrix colors as the Bt1 horizon.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay."
