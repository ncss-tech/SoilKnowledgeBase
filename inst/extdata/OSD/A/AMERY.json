  "OVERVIEW": "The Amery series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy loam till or mudflow sediments. These soils are on end moraines, disintegration moraines, and on dissected ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
