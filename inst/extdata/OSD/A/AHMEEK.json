  "OVERVIEW": "The Ahmeek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a friable loamy mantle and the underlying dense loamy till.  These soils are on till plains, moraines, and drumlins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters.",
