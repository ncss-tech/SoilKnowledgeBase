  "OVERVIEW": "The Ahren series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glacial till mainly from shale and limestone with mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Ahren soils are on glaciated foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The depth to the 2Bw horizon ranges from 10 to 13 inches.\nThe A horizon, when present, has chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  Texture is loam or silt loam.  A thin E horizon fromed in younger volcanic ash is at the surface in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10 YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Pedons having chroma of 3 have value of 6 dry or 4 moist.  It is loam or silt loam.  This horizon has 1 to 10 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10 YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.
