    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist in all horizons, but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and fall.  Mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The mantle of volcanic ash and loess is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The particle size control section has 15 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.  The depth to the 2Bw horizon ranges from 10 to 13 inches.\nThe A horizon, when present, has chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  Texture is loam or silt loam.  A thin E horizon fromed in younger volcanic ash is at the surface in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10 YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Pedons having chroma of 3 have value of 6 dry or 4 moist.  It is loam or silt loam.  This horizon has 1 to 10 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10 YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 when dry and 3 to 5 when moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 when dry or moist.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ahren soils are on glaciated foothills and mountains at elevations of 1,800 to 3,800 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash and loess over glacial  till from dark colored shaly rock and limestone.  The climate is characterized by dry summers and cold, moist  winters.  Average annual precipitation is 22 to 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season (28F) is about 90 to 110 days."
