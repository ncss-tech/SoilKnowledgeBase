These soils are frequently flooded for brief periods with salt water, which occur during times of high wind that pushes water onto the wind-tidal flats, storm surges, and heavy rains associated with tropical storms."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for wildlife habitat or recreation.  These soils are essentially barren of vegetation except for sparse salicornia and sesuvium species at the higher elevations.  The surface will often have a thin algal mat.  Halophytic vegetation consisting of saltwort and glassworts occur for short periods after recent inundation.  The surface salinity rises as the surface dries, and eventually becomes toxic to the plants.  The ecological site is Tidal Flat, PE 31-44 (R150BY416TX)."
