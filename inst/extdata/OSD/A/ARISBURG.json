  "OVERVIEW": "The Arisburg series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes on uplands, and on treads and risers on high stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (about 55 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters (about 35 inches).",
