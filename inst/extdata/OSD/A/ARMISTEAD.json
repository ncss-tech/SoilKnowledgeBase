  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThese soils were formerly classified in the Alluvial great soil group. These soils are considered to have argillic horizons, though the 2Bt horizons do not have the required clay increase for an argillic horizon. The higher clay content in the 2A horizon is due to mixing with the overwash clay A horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 62 to 112 cm (24 to 44 in) (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2 Bt3 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 62 cm (0 to 24 in) (Ap, A and 2Ab horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 62 to 135 cm (24 to 53 in) (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions: 35 to 62 cm (14 to 24 in) (2Ab horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: upper boundary of the 2Ab horizon 35 cm (14 in)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by KSSL laboratory data number S2010LA081001 from Red River Parish, Louisiana.\nEdited 01/2017 (JAD-MJB) Changed to tabular format. Updated pedon description, Range in Characteristics, and other sections.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data is from type location S2010LA081001 Red River Parish, Louisiana.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
