Depth to hard consolidated serpentinite bedrock ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the Oi and A horizons, from moderately acid to slightly acid in the Bo1 horizon and from slightly acid to neutral in the Bo2 and BC horizons.  The combined total of iron stone fragments in the control section is less than 15 percent, by volume.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is mucky peat or muck in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4. Texture is clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr layer is composed of hard fractured and moderately weathered serpentinite.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured consolidated serpentinite bedrock."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 68 to 134 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F."

El Descanso (T) and Hoconuco (T) soils do not have an oxic horizon and are coarser textured.  Cerro Gordo (T) soils are on more stable positions and are very deep.  Indiera (T) soils are on similar positions but are deep to serpentinite bedrock.  Guama (T) soils are on similar positions but do not have a paralithic or lithic contact within 80 inches."

A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nAljibe soils are in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
