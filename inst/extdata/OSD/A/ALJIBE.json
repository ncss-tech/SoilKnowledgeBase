A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nThe 2021 revision updates the classification from clayey, ferruginous, isothermic, shallow Rhodic Haploperox (2008).\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 16 inches (Oi and A horizons).\nOxic horizon - the zone from 16 to 31 inches (Bo1 and Bo2 horizons).\nRhodic feature - the zone from 10 to 35 inches (A, Bo1, Bo2 and BC horizons).\nParalithic contact - the zone from 35 to 47 inches (Cr horizon).\nLithic contact - the contact at 47 inches (R horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
