Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red are few or common.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay, or their channery or very channery counterparts with thin strata of very fine sandy loam and clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.

Cadeville soils have a udic moisture regime and chroma of 3 or more in the upper part of the subsoil.  Edna, Lufkin, Oakhurst, and Overcup soils have medium acid or more alkaline Bt horizons.  Herty soils contain more soluble salt and gypsum.  Mayhew soils have neither fragments of sandstone in the substrata nor an abrupt textural change from the albic to the argillic horizon."

The regolith is marine deposits of acid clay to silty clay loam of the Catahoula Formation that contain fragments of siltstone or sandstone.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature near the type location ranges from 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 60 inches."
