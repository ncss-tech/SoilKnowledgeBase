    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 55 to 80 inches or more. Depth to the Bt horizon is more than 37 inches from the surface.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Where value is 3 or less, thickness is less than 10 inches.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  A thin transitional horizon is present at the base of the E horizon in many pedons.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2.  It is weakly to moderately cemented in 50 to 90 percent of the horizon.  Sand grains are well coated.  Some pedons have a lower Bh horizon that is noncemented and have the same range of colors and textures.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nIn some pedons, a Bw&Bh horizon is at the base of the Bh horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Fragments of Bh horizon range from few to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red range from few to common.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe E' horizon, where present, is between the Bh and Btg horizon.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has colors similar to that of the Btg horizon.  Textures range from sand to loamy fine sand."

Basinger soils are on similar positions, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  The poorly drained Farmton soils lack ortstein and are on similar to higher positions.  The poorly drained Lawnwood and Pepper soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have spodic horizons less than 30 inches from the surface.  In addition, Lawnwood soils lack argillic horizons.  Nettles and Oldsmar soils are on similar positions and have high base status in the argillic horizon.  In addition, Oldsmar soils lack ortstein.  The poorly drained Salerno soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, are more than 50 inches to the spodic horizon, and lack argillic horizons.  The poorly drained Susanna and Tantile soils are on similar to higher positions and have A and E horizons less than 30 inches thick.  In addition, the argillic horizon of the Susanna soil is less than 37 from the surface.  Wabasso soils are on similar positions but lack ortstein.  Waveland soils are on similar positions and are sandy throughout."

The vegetation consists of longleaf pine, slash pine, saw palmetto, waxmyrtle, gallberry, fetterbush, creeping bluestem, chalky bluestem, lopsided Indiangrass, low panicums and pineland threeawn.  Depressional areas are dominated by marsh vegetation consisting of maidencane, cutgrass, sand cordgrass, and St. Johns wort."
