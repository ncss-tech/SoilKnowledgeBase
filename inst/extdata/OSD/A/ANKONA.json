  "OVERVIEW": "The Ankona series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained, very slowly or slowly permeable soils on broad flats and in depressional areas of central and southern Florida.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

It is weakly to moderately cemented in 50 to 90 percent of the horizon.  Sand grains are well coated.  Some pedons have a lower Bh horizon that is noncemented and have the same range of colors and textures.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nIn some pedons, a Bw&Bh horizon is at the base of the Bh horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Fragments of Bh horizon range from few to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.

In addition, Lawnwood soils lack argillic horizons.  Nettles and Oldsmar soils are on similar positions and have high base status in the argillic horizon.  In addition, Oldsmar soils lack ortstein.  The poorly drained Salerno soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, are more than 50 inches to the spodic horizon, and lack argillic horizons.  The poorly drained Susanna and Tantile soils are on similar to higher positions and have A and E horizons less than 30 inches thick.
