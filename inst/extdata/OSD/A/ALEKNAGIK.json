The series was proposed in the 1964 Dillingham Area, Alaska, Soil Survey. Established during the final correlation of the Togiak, AK Soil Survey where it is also used. The tentative series Snagpoint was correlated to Aleknagik, which had previously not been established. Previous classification was coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Spodic Dystrocryepts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
