  "OVERVIEW": "The Aleknagik series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial drift on rises and of plains and on hills. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.",

The series was proposed in the 1964 Dillingham Area, Alaska, Soil Survey. Established during the final correlation of the Togiak, AK Soil Survey where it is also used. The tentative series Snagpoint was correlated to Aleknagik, which had previously not been established. Previous classification was coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Spodic Dystrocryepts."
