  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. The soils are more than 60 inches deep. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick. Depth to aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less is 10 to 18 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. Texture is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. It has few to common, faint to distinct redox concentrations.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate prismatic or subangular structure. In the lower part it has some brittleness like that of fragipans. Texture is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. It has few to common, faint to distinct redox concentrations.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. It has few to common, faint to distinct redox concentrations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Amity soils are on broad terraces at elevations of 150 to 400 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in indistinctly stratified silty alluvium and lacustrine silts of upper Pleistocene age. Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the depositional stratigraphy of the Amity soil profile developed in the following Willamette Formation Members: (1) Greenback Member, and (2) Irish Bend Member. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches. The average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."

Concord and Dayton soils have aquic conditions and chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 0 to 10 inches. In addition, Concord is fine and Dayton has an abrupt textural change from the E to 2Bt\nhorizon. They occur in depressions on terraces. Willamette soils lack aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less between 0 and 40 inches and do not have an albic horizon. They are on higher terraces or more sloping positions. Aloha soils do not have a mollic epipedon or an albic horizon and are on higher terraces. Woodburn soils have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or l3ss and redox concentrations at a depth of 20 to 30 inches, lack an albic horizon, and are on higher terraces or more sloping positions."

Some cannery crops are grown where the soil is artificially drained. A small amount remains in native vegetation of annual and perennial grasses, wild blackberries, wild rose, and widely spaced oak trees."
