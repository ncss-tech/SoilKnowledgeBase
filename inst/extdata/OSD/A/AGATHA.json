  "OVERVIEW": "The Agatha series consists of deep, well drained soils on benches, plateaus, escarpments, and canyonsides. They formed in colluvium or residuum weathered from basalt with a mixed loess and volcanic ash mantle. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
