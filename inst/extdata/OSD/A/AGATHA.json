These soils formed in colluvium or residuum weathered from basalt with a mixed loess and volcanic ash mantle. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. Elevations are 1,050 to 5,000 feet (328 to 1524 meters). The climate is cool, subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 41 inches (600 to 1040 mm); average annual air temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is 70 to 130 days."
