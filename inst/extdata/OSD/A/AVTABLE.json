  "OVERVIEW": "The Avtable series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff.  They are on summits and sideslopes of foothills and structural benches. Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
