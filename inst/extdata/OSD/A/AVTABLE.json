Elevations range 1,525 to 1,955 meters.  These soils formed in residuum and alluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 330 to 410 mm, and average annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 95 days."

Hurryback and Monasterio soils have mollic epipedons and are on less exposed aspects.  Squawcreek soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and are on similar landscape positions."
