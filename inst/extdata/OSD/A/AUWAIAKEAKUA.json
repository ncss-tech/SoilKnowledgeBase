  "OVERVIEW": "The Auwaiakeakua series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 360 millimeters (14 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 28 degrees C (82 degrees F).",

The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 180 to 510 millimeters (7 to 20 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from December through April.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2540 millimeters (80 to 100 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees C (76 to 86 degrees F).  The mean summer and the mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
