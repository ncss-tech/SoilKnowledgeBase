These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of rolling to hilly `a`a flows that are 5,000 to 15,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 180 to 510 millimeters (7 to 20 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from December through April.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2540 millimeters (80 to 100 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees C (76 to 86 degrees F).  The mean summer and the mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
