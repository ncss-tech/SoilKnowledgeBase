  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to horizons with more than 5 percent plinthite ranges from 24 to 50 inches. Nodules of ironstone range from 0 to 8 percent throughout the profile.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed. Most pedons have 2 to 35 percent, by volume, tongues of albic material in the B horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4. Organic matter and iron depletions in shades of gray range from none to many. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron and organic matter accumulations in shades of red, brown or yellow range from few to many. Texture is loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Bg/Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron and organic matter accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of one or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7. Iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many. Some pedons have no dominant color and are variegated in shades of gray, yellow, red and brown. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Btvg horizon is generally variegated in shades of gray, brown, red, and yellow. Many pedons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7 and having iron accumulations in shades of red, brown and yellow. The upper 20 inches of the Btvg horizon has more than 20 percent silt and 6 to 18 percent clay. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the upper part and loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the lower part. Some pedons have a texture of sandy clay or clay below a depth of about 50 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no known series in the same family. Series in closely related families include the Escambia, Pansey, Poarch, Robertsdale and Saucier series. The somewhat poorly drained Escambia and Robertsdale soils are on slightly higher positions. In addition, Robertsdale soils have fine-loamy control sections. Pansey soils are on similar positions and have fine-loamy control sections. The moderately well and well drained Poarch and Saucier soils are on higher positions. In addition, Saucier soils have fine-loamy control sections."

They formed in sandy and loamy marine deposits. The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches."

These soils have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in their profiles. Basin and Mashulaville soils have fragipans. In addition, the somewhat poorly drained Basin soil is on slightly higher positions."
