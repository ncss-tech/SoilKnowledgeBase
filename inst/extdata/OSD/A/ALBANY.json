    "content": "REMARKS: Albany soils have sandy layers that extend to a depth of more than 100 centimeters (about 40 inches). They were originally classified as Grossarenic Paleudults; however, they are presently classified as Aquic Arenic by the order in which they occur in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 10th Edition.  Plans are underway to revise the Key and a re-classification to a subgroup that recognizes the Grossarenic feature is anticipated.\nData collected in Effingham County, GA indicate depth to redoximorphic features thought to indicate dominant seasonal wetness range from about 53 to 74 centimeters with an average depth of 63 centimeters. However, during the wettest periods of the non-growing season (typically January), Albany soils may be saturated for short periods (less than 20 consecutive or 30 cumulative days in a normal year) at a depth of 30 to 50 centimeters.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to about 123 centimeters; about 48 inches (Ap, E1, E2, E3 horizons).\nGrossarenic feature--a zone with sandy particle-size class extending from 0 to about 122 centimeters; about 48 inches (Ap and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon--the zone from approximately 122 to 224 centimeters; about 48 to 88 inches (Bt and Btg horizons).\nAquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from about 64 to 203 centimeters; about 25 to 80 inches at some time during the year (endosaturation).\nRedox concentrations--the zone from 18 to 203 centimeters; about 7 to 80 inches (E, Bt, and Btg horizons)\nRedox depletions with chroma of 2 or less--the zone from 64 to 203 centimeters; about 25 to 88 inches (E2, E3, Bt, and Btg horizons)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters; about 80 inches\n07/2007. The type location was moved to another site in Effingham County, GA to better reflect the central concept of the series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (Lab Pedon Number=02N0660; User Pedon ID=S02FL-121-005).\nDatabase Information:\nData Mapunit ID--To be developed\nTypical Pedon User Pedon ID--To be developed\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
