  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Arp soils are on undulating to steep phyllite and schist hills. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 60 percent. These soils are formed in slope alluvium over schist and phyllite bedrock. Arp soils are at elevations of 4,000 to 5,500 feet in a semiarid continental climate with an average annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches. About one-half of this occurs in July and August as rain and about one-third in December, January and February as rain with some snow. The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 57 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 140 to 200 days."
