  "OVERVIEW": "The Alliance series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in a thin layer of loamy loess and the underlying calcareous, weakly cemented limestone or sandstone. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow. These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
