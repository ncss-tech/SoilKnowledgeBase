Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to calcareous materials is 6 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 20 percent throughout the whole soil and consist of 1/2- to 1-inch angular shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Matrix texture is typically sandy loam but ranges from sandy loam to very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  The matrix texture of the upper Btn is silty clay, sandy clay, clay, or clay loam averaging 35 to 50 percent clay.  The reaction of the upper Btn is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  Matrix texture of the lower Btn is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction of the lower Btn is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline unless buffered by salts.  ESP is 15 to 30.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Abston soils are on hillslopes and terrace escarpments. These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from soft, strongly sodic shales. Elevation is 6,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 34 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June. The frost-free season is about 80 to 110 days but frost may occur in any month."
