  "OVERVIEW": "The Abston series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to shale.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from sodic shales.  Abston soils are on upland hillslopes.  Slopes are 1 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Coarse fragments range from 0 to 20 percent throughout the whole soil and consist of 1/2- to 1-inch angular shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Matrix texture is typically sandy loam but ranges from sandy loam to very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  The matrix texture of the upper Btn is silty clay, sandy clay, clay, or clay loam averaging 35 to 50 percent clay.  The reaction of the upper Btn is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  Matrix texture of the lower Btn is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction of the lower Btn is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline unless buffered by salts.
