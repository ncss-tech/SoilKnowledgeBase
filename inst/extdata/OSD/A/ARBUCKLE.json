  "OVERVIEW": "The Arbuckle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Arbuckle soils are on low terraces, and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 508 millimeters (20 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

The parent material is alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Rock fragments are dominantly quartz and chert.. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 89 centimeters (10 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F.), average January temperature about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F.), and average July temperature about 28 degrees C (83 degrees F.) Frost-free season ranges from 152 to 280 days."
