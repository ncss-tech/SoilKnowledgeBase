  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Arbuckle soils are on low terraces at elevations of 9 to 610 meters ( 30 to 2,000 feet) and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The parent material is alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Rock fragments are dominantly quartz and chert.. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 89 centimeters (10 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F.), average January temperature about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F.), and average July temperature about 28 degrees C (83 degrees F.) Frost-free season ranges from 152 to 280 days."
