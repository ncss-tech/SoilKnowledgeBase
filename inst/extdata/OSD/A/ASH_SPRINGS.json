  "OVERVIEW": "The Ash Springs series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks and the alluvium has been modified by lime precipitated from upward moving thermal springs waters.  Ash springs soils are on smooth flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",

It commonly contains extremely hard lime cemented as much as 50 percent by volume of lime cemented nodules.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 25 to 40 percent.\nC horizon\nContains at least 5 percent less calcium carbonate than either the Bk horizons.\nRedoximorphic features: Some pedons have 5YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y hue below depths of 90 cm.  The redder hues are normally accompanied by chroma of 4 or more, and the yellow hues are accompanied by chroma of 2 through 4."

They formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks and the alluvium has been modified by lime precipitated from upward moving thermal spring waters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 175 cm.  The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C.  The frost free season is about 170 days."

The soils has seasonally high water table; the water table is highest in winter and spring and lowest in the fall.  Depth to the water table ranges from 90 to 137 cm in the better drained areas and from 46 to 90 cm in the wettest areas.  Runoff is very slow;  moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as calcium carbonate Solonchaks.  Properties for classifying the soil in an Aquic subgroup are marginal despite flucuating high water table.  It is assumed that these soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less and redox concentrations above 100 cm or that exchangeable sodium decreases below 50 cm, or both.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 33 to 94 cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizon)\nParticle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A, Bk1, Bk2 and the upper part of the C horizon)\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 4/2012. ET"
