  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ashflat soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on toeslope, footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in eolian volcanic ash and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,340 to 2,780 meters.  The climate is continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
