Armagh soils have more than 5 percent shale fragments in the lower part of the solum.  Elkton soils formed in costal plain sediments and have many minerals in sand size fraction which are quartz.  Kinkora soils have common to many mica flakes throughout the soil.  Purdy soils do not have sandy textures in the C horizon and are developed in slackwater deposited alluvial from shale and siltstone.  Baile, Chatuge and Shrewsbury soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Colemantown has glauconitic mineralogy.  Othello soils have a fine-silty particle size control section.  Roanoke and Worsham soils have a thermic temperature regime."
