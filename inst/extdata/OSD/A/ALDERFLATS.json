  "OVERVIEW": "The Alderflats series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on nearly level upland depressions.  They formed in material weathered from acid crystalline rocks of granite, gneiss and schists.  Mean annual air temperature is 51 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",

Armagh soils have more than 5 percent shale fragments in the lower part of the solum.  Elkton soils formed in costal plain sediments and have many minerals in sand size fraction which are quartz.  Kinkora soils have common to many mica flakes throughout the soil.  Purdy soils do not have sandy textures in the C horizon and are developed in slackwater deposited alluvial from shale and siltstone.  Baile, Chatuge and Shrewsbury soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Colemantown has glauconitic mineralogy.  Othello soils have a fine-silty particle size control section.  Roanoke and Worsham soils have a thermic temperature regime."
