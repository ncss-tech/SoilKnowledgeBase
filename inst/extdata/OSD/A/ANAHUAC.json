  "OVERVIEW": "The Anahuac series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (degrees 69 F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).",

Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils become saturated from 20 to 100 cm (8 to 40 in) below the soil surface from January to March and endosaturation occurs from 122 to 203 cm (48 to 80 in) below the surface during the same period."

The principal crops grown on these soils are sorghums, soybeans, and rice.  Pastures are bahiagrass or improved bermudagrass.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grass, mainly species of andropogons, paspalums, switchgrass and indiangrass."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification changed and type location moved to Jefferson County 1995 where complete characterization data is available.  Study of this series in Liberty, Chambers, and Jefferson Counties indicates this soil is a Oxyaquic Glossudalfs rather than Udollic Albaqualfs.  Soil moisture study at type location indicates this soil is in Oxyaquic subgroup.  Soils mapped with the Anahuac series that are on mounded positions will be included with the Spindletop series, which has smectitic mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 46 to 96 cm (18 to 38 in) (Bt/E and Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nUmbric epipedon 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in) (Ap and A horizons).\nGlossic horizon 46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 in) (Bt/E horizon).\nArgillic horizon 46 to 203 cm (18 to 80 in (Bt/E, Bt1, Bt2, Btg1,\nBtg2, Btg3 horizons).\nAdditional Comments: This soil has an Umbric epipedon. These soils do not qualify for Mollisols because the base saturation above the argillic horizon is less than 50 percent. These soils are saturated in the Bt/E horizon for 20 or more days in normal years. Mineralogy data indicate the clay to be smectitic."
