  "REVDATE": "01/2002",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Alicia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in medium and moderately fine textured silty calcareous sediments derived from shale and fine grained sandstone.  Alicia soils are on fans,  terraces, and piedmont slopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
