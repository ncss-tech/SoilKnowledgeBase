  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of shale is 24 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 to 66 F. at 20 inch depth.  From about late April or May until November the soils are continuously dry and cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of 20 inches or more.  The rest of the year the soils are moist in some or all parts below 5 inches and the cracks are closed.  Few to many slickensides are present in some part from near the surface to near the contact with soft shale.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2 with moist values of 3 or more.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or clay and has 35 to 55 percent clay.  Coarse fragments of shale and other rock fragments are less than 5 percent.  This horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline, but is not calcareous in the upper 12 to 20 inches or none of the A horizon is calcareous.  In the less alkaline soils, alkalinity increases with depth.\nThe Bk horizon is 10YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/4 and value is one or two units higher than in the A horizon.  It is clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Coarse fragments of shale and other rock fragments are 0 to 10 percent."

Altamont, Auld, Ayar, Centerville, Cropley, Myers, and Porterville soils have a paralithic contact at depths of more than 40 inches.  Aido soils have cracks that are closed for 90 days or less.  Cibo and Climara soils have a lithic contact.  Vaquero soils are calcareous throughout with a moist color value of more than 3 throughout."

The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.; average January temperature is 48 to 58 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 200 to 310 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Altamont series has been split into two series.  Soils deeper than 40 inches to a paralithic contact are retained in the Altamont series.  Soils less than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact are placed in the Alo series.  On July 17, 1984, a decision was made about the lowest possible limit of the mean annual precipitation.  This lowest limit appears to be 9 inches because it seems to keep the climate and the moisture necessary for a Xeric moisture regime.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 inches (A1,A2)\nParalithic contact - the boundary at 36 inches (Cr)\nSeries reclassified on June 1996\nRunoff terminology adjusted 6/96 to the adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Twp pedons sampled in Orange Co. as Solano.  They occur in MLRA outside what is typical for the series: NSSL pedons S71CA-059-008 and -009.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
