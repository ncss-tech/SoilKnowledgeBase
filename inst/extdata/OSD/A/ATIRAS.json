  "OVERVIEW": "The Atiras series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age over loamy Quaternary alluvium.  These soils are on gently undulating eolian plains associated with vegetated longitudinal dunes on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).",
