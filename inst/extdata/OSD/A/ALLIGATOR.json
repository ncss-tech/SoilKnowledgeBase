  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:\nDrainage class: Poorly drained\nSaturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): Cracks ranging from 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2.5 inches) wide and extending to as much as 0.6 to 0.9 meters (2 to 3 feet) in depth, form in these soils during the summer and early fall months in normal years. This allows for very rapid infiltration of water; and as the clay is wetted, it swells, forcing the cracks to close.  The upper 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) ranges from low to moderately high: 0.01 to 4.00 um/sec (0.0 to 0.6 in/hr).  The subsoil within the particle size control section ranges from very low to low: 0.01 to 0.42 um/sec (0.0 to 0.06 in/hr).\nPermeability: Very slow\nSurface runoff: Very high on slopes of 1 percent or more; high on areas with slope less than 1 percent; negligible in depressional areas.\nDepth to seasonal high water table: The soil is saturated in the surface layer and along cracks and slickenside faces in the subsoil from December through July during normal years.\nFlooding frequency and duration:  Rare to frequent flooding; brief to long in low-lying areas and along tributaries. Areas along the lower courses of tributary streams to the Mississippi River are subject to backwater flooding.\nPonding frequency and duration: It is ponded in depressional areas for brief to very long duration."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is reclassified from very-fine, montmorillonitic, acid, thermic Vertic Haplaquepts as the result of a special study in April 1986 by NCSS representatives from Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, the National Soil Survey Laboratory, and South National Technical Center. The classification was changed from Alfic to Chromic based on changes to the Keys to Taxonomy, 8th Edition, 1998. The present type location pedon actually classifies in an Aeric subgroup by 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) {2.5Y 5/2 matrix at 74 centimeters (29 inches) deep}, however additional study is needed to determine whether this is typical for Alligator soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap1, Ap2).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 165 centimeters (7 to 65 inches) (Bg, Bssg1, Bssg2, and Bssycg).\nAquic conditions - episaturation in the zone from 0 to 74 centimeters (0 to 29 inches) (Ap1, Ap2, Bg, and Bssg1 horizons).\nSlickensides- the zone from 48 to 165 centimeters (19 to 65 inches) (intersecting).\nAll phases of the Alligator series are listed as hydric soils in the \"Hydric Soils of the United States\" (SCS Misc. Pub. No. 1491).\nDrained phases (0-5 percent slopes) of the Alligator series that are protected from flooding and are not frequently flooded during the growing season are considered prime farmland.\nSoil classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data for the Alligator series is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http://ncsslab-datamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nUser Site ID: S1956MS083003\nUser Pedon ID: S1956MS083003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
