  "OVERVIEW": "The Armenta series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from pumice.  Armenta soils are on interfluves on undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
