They formed in slope alluvium derived from air-fall pumice of the Quaternary Age Cajete Member. Slopes are 3 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Chiminet soils are loamy, very shallow to bedrock, and are on shoulders and backslopes of interfluves."
