  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Adeland soils are on landforms influenced by Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying glacial drift over residuum. In places the residuum is from stratified siltstone and shale, but in other areas the residuum is from a single component. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

The well drained Loudonville soils are on higher lying rises on bedrock terraces. The poorly drained Mahalasville, bedrock substratum soils are in depressions. The very deep, moderately well drained Miami, Rainsville, and Rockfield soils, and the well drained Russell soils are on till plains. The well drained Silverwood soils are on lower lying stream terraces underlain with sand and gravel."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the loess or silty material; moderately high in the drift; and moderately low or moderately high in the underlying residuum. Permeability is moderate in the loess or silty material, moderately slow in the glacial drift, and slow or moderately slow in the underlying residuum."
