  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Adeland series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying glacial drift over residuum weathered from interbedded acid siltstone and shale. The Adeland soils are on landforms influenced by Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying glacial drift over residuum. In places the residuum is from stratified siltstone and shale, but in other areas the residuum is from a single component. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."
