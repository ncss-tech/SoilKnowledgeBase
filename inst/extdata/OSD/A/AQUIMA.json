  "OVERVIEW": "The Aquima series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from siltstone, sandstone and shale on structural benches, fan remnants of valley sides, and stream terraces of valley floors. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches (279 mm), and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F (11.1 degrees C).",
