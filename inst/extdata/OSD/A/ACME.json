  "OVERVIEW": "The Acme series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium or lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on stream terraces of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Acme series was previously described as having a solum 10 to 20 inches thick and underlain by gypsiferous caliche, gypsite or alabaster gypsum.  Study of these soils in 1999, across the series province, has shown solum depth to range mainly from 20 to 40 inches to gypsiferous materials and a gypsic horizon.  The Cottonwood series, which has been mapped mainly in upland positions, but also in a complex with Acme soils in some areas, will be typified with a paralithc contact of massive gypsum bedrock and will be limited to upland positions associated with Permain age materials.  A new series will be developed to typify the soils that have been mapped in a complex with Acme soils.  Mollisols that have been mapped in the Acme series underlain with massive gypsum bedrock, mainly alabaster, will be included with the Vinson series.\nEdited 01/2017 (RFG-ROG): Added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in).  (Bw, Bk, and Bky horizons).\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19 in).  (A and Bw horizons).\nGypsic horizon: 81 to 203 cm (32 to 80 in).  (Bky horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data (S98OK-065-005) Jackson County, OK, and type location (S99TX-075-002) Childress County, TX.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
