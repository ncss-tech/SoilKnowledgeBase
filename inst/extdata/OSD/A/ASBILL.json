    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 5 and 17 inches is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30.  Cracks open and close once a year.  Vertical cracks are 1 to 4 inches wide and 20 to 40 inches deep when fully open.  Cracks are fully open from July 1 to October 15 and fully closed from January 1 to April 30.  Common slickensides are present in at least the lower part of the A horizon and the upper part of the C horizon.  Gilgai relief is present in some pedons.  The profile is heavy clay loam, clay or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  The upper part of the A horizon has a clay content of 30 to 40 percent.  The soils are calcareous and mildly or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2; 2.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 6/2; 5Y 4/2 or 5/2.   Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 5/2; 5Y 3/2 or 4/2.  Color value is 5 or less dry, and 3 or less, moist, in at least half of the upper 12 to 15 inches.\nThe Bk horizon is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/2; 5Y 5/2, 5/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2; 5Y 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3."
