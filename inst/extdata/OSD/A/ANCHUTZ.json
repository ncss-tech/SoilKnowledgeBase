  "OVERVIEW": "The Anchutz series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on relict fan aprons, fan terraces, pediments, and toeslopes. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 11 to 20 inches. Depth to horizons of carbonate accumulation ranges from 4 to 15 inches. EC is less than 1 mmho in the A and Bt horizons and ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos in the Bk horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel. Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Clay ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel. Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine or coarser sands. It is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. Carbonate clay ranges from 5 to 10 percent. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 25 percent when averaged. Some pedons have pockets of carbonate ranging up to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline."

Elevations are 6,500 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow and less commonly as rain in April, May, and early June. The mean annual temperature is about 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is estimated to range from 75 to 110 days depending on elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
