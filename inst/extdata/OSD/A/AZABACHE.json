  "OVERVIEW": "The Azabache series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian and slope alluvium derived from basalt, sandstone, and shale. Azabache soils are on valley sides and floors, lava plateaus, and volcanic cones. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
