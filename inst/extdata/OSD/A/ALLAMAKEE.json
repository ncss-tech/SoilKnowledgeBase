    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: No other series in this family.  Similar series are Frankville, Massbach, Nassett, Valton and the Village(T) series.  Frankville and Nassett soils have limestone bedrock within 60 inches.  Massbach soils have shale bedrock within 50 inches.  Valton soils do not have a 20 percent clay decrease from the clay maximum within 150 cm.  The Village(T) soils do not have mollic colors in the surface layer."

Allamakee soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess over clayey pedisediment or residuum.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 38 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Downs, Lacrescent, Paintcreek(T), Tama and Village(T) soils.  The Downs and Tama soils formed entirely in loess and are on the less sloping, broader ridgetops above the Allamakee soils. Lacrescent soils formed in loamy colluvial material and are on the steeper side slopes below the Allamakee soils.  The Paintcreek(T) soils have a thinner loess mantle and are typically down slope from the Allamakee soils. The Village(T) soils formed in similar materials and are on similar landscape positions."
