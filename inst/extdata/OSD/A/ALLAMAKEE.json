  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Allamakee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a mantle of loess and in the underlying clayey pedisediment or residuum from dolomite on summits or upper side slopes of dissected uplands.  These soils have moderate permeability in the upper part and slow permeability in the lower part.  Slopes range from 5 to 18 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees, and mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.",

The Downs and Tama soils formed entirely in loess and are on the less sloping, broader ridgetops above the Allamakee soils.

The Paintcreek(T) soils have a thinner loess mantle and are typically down slope from the Allamakee soils. The Village(T) soils formed in similar materials and are on similar landscape positions."
