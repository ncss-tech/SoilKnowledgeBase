The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the upper part of the solum except for surface layers that have been limed.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum.  The calcium-magnesium ratio ranges from about 0.1 to 0.9.\nThe A horizon is brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  It is silt loam.\nThe B horizon is gray (10YR 6/1, 5/1; N 6/0) or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2).  It has few or common mottles in shades of yellow, olive, and brown.  It is silt loam.\nThe Bx horizon is gray (10YR 6/1, 5/1; N 6/0), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y  6/2) or light gray (10YR 7/1).  it has common distinct mottles of shades of olive, yellow, and brown.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe IIBt horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) or has colors similar to those given for the Bx horizon. It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam with a high component of sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Almaville soils have siliceous mineralogy and the fragipan is underlain by clay that developed in residuum from limestone.  Hatchie soils are better drained han Almo soils. Hatchie soils have dominant color of yellowish brown in the B horizon above the fragipan.  Henry soils have less than 10 percent sand to depths greater than 48 inches."
