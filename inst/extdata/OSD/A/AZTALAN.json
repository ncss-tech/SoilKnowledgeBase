Andres soils average more than 27 percent clay in the particle_size control section;  Darroch and La Hogue soils have less than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.   Francesville and Odell soils have a densic contact at 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches).  Gilboa, Le Sueur, and Marcellon soils are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section. In addition, Le Sueur and Marcellon soils have rock fragments there and Marcellon soils have less than 20 percent clay there. Houstenader soils do not have carbonates within the series control section and have gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Lahoguess soils have 80 to 98 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.   Newhaven soils have soils have lamellae in the lower part of the series control section.  Protivin soils average more than 28 percent clay in the particle-size control section.   Vigar soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Aztalan soils are on glacial lake basins and stream terraces.  Slope  ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in a mantle of loamy outwash and in mostly silty and clayey  stratified lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 890 mm (26  to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kibbie, Martinton, and Navan soils.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Navan soils form a drainage sequence with Aztalan soils and are the most common associates in the nearly level and gently undulating landscapes.  Aztalan, Kibbie, and Martinson are soils often associated in the landscape but cannot be identified with or separated one from another by specific relief; consequently, all reflect the varying influences of stratification and overwash.  Kibbie soils formed in thinly stratified silty and very fine sandy deposits, whereas Martinton soils formed in stratified silty and clayey deposits."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. Surface runoff is medium or low.   Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy outwash mantle and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying lacustrine deposits. Permeability is moderate in the loamy outwash mantle and moderately slow in the underlying stratified lacustrine deposit. These soil have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 76 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) for some time in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n7/04  The concept of this series is a mantle of loamy outwash over silty and clayey stratified lacustrine deposits. In some county surveys, soils that formed in loamy outwash over clayey till have also been correlated as Aztalan. This includes at least part of the acreage of Aztalan in the Kenosha-Racine and Ozaukee soil surveys and possibly the Milwaukee-Waukesha and other surveys. These areas need to be correlated to another (new?) series when the surveys are updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon -  0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (AP and A ); argillic horizon - 31 to 109 cm (12 to 43 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4); aquic feature  redox features and saturation within 16 inches of the surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
