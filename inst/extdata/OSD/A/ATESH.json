  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was derived from a fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Nadurargids (Jerryslu Series) but has been ripped to a depth of at least 43 inches in the typical pedon, and has been treated with farm chemicals (gypsum, sulfuric acid, etc.) and large amounts of irrigation water.  This has fractured and partially dissolved the duripan that was present, and destroyed the natric horizon leaving clay films on displaced fragments of the original horizon. This soil was originally proposed as a new subgroup of \"Duric Natric\" as the soils shows identifiable fragments of the original duripan and original natric horizons which have been destroyed. The identifiable fragments of these horizons no longer meet the criteria of a duripan or natric horizons. Part of the evidence used to determine these soils once had duripans and natric horizons are the soils in immediately adjacent areas that have not been modified, by analyzing previous mapping, the experience and judgement of the Soil Scientists responsible for the mapping, and by documenting the land use history.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization samples from pedon S92CA-107-002 and S92CA-107-003 from Tulare County, California, samples by SSL, Lincoln, NE, 3/94.
