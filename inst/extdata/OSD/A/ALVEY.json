  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Alvey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and reworked eolian material derived from sandstone and shale. Alvey soils are on alluvial flats, and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
