    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that is evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of a slight increase in the spring and a more significant increase in the late summer.  Melt water from snowpack causes these soils to be moist into April and early May.  The soil is driest during late May and June.  The soil has an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature: 47 to 53 degrees F\nDepth to argillic horizon: 2 to 4 inches\nDepth to lithic contact: 6 to 20 inches\nLithology of rock fragments: sandstone\nParticle-size control section:\nClay content: 18 to 35 percent\nA horizon:\nHue: 5YR to 10YR\nValue:3 to 5 dry or moist\nChroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist\nTexture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loam\nRock fragments: 0 to 75 percent\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 10 percent\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline\nBt horizon:\nHue: 5YR to 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma: 3 to 6 dry or moist\nTexture: sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam\nRock fragments: 0 to 30 percent\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 10 percent\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline\nBtk horizon (present in some pedons)\nHue: 5YR to 10YR\nValue: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma: 2 to 6 dry or moist\nTexture: sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam\nRock fragments: 0 to 30 percent\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 15  percent\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline\nSome pedons may have Bk horizons directly above the lithic contact."
