  "OVERVIEW": "The Arabrab series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in reworked eolian deposits, slope alluvium derived from sandstone, or slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  Arabrab soils are on structural benches, mesas, cuestas, hills, and ridges.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil has an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature: 47 to 53 degrees F\nDepth to argillic horizon: 2 to 4 inches\nDepth to lithic contact: 6 to 20 inches\nLithology of rock fragments: sandstone\nParticle-size control section:\nClay content: 18 to 35 percent\nA horizon:\nHue: 5YR to 10YR\nValue:3 to 5 dry or moist\nChroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist\nTexture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loam\nRock fragments: 0 to 75 percent\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 10 percent\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline\nBt horizon:\nHue: 5YR to 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma: 3 to 6 dry or moist\nTexture: sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam\nRock fragments: 0 to 30 percent\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 10 percent\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline\nBtk horizon (present in some pedons)\nHue: 5YR to 10YR\nValue: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma: 2 to 6 dry or moist\nTexture: sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam\nRock fragments: 0 to 30 percent\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 15  percent\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline\nSome pedons may have Bk horizons directly above the lithic contact."
