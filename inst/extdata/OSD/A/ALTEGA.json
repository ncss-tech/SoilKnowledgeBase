    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amal(NM), Buick(CO), Chevelon(AZ), Chita(NM), Elpedro(NM), Keiser(MT), Klinedraw(WY), Moncha(NM), Oshoto(WY), Pulpit(CO), Roubideau(CO), Sharps(CO), Verde(CO), Wetherill(NM), and Wiley(CO) series.  Amal and Elpedro soils receive higher amounts of winter precipitation. In addition, Amal soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches and Elpedro soils are weathered from limestone and are dominated by silt loam and silty clay loam textures.  Chita soils have igneous parent materials and do not have buried horizons.  Buick, Keiser, Klinedraw, Oshoto, and Wiley soils are more moist in the late spring and early summer (May and June) and dry in late summer in the soil moisture control section.  Chevelon soils are moderately deep to bedrock and do not have secondary carbonates within the profile.  Moncha soils have silt loam and silty clay loam textures and do not have accumulations of secondary carbonates.  Pulpit, Roubideau, and Verde soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Sharps soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Wetherill soils receive higher amounts of winter precipitation and have calcic horizons below 40 inches.\nOne of the above series currently listed as a competitor is the Chita(NM) series. Chita soils have calcic horizons within 40 inches and should be reclassified in the Calcidic subgroup."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Altega soils are on summits and shoulders of interfluves on undulating plateaus and on fan aprons. They formed in Triassic and Permian age eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes are 3 to 10 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 7,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Aliante soils have a mollic epipedon and occur on toeslopes and footslopes of undulating plateaus.  Altezita soils are loamy, are very shallow, and occur on beveled summits.  Estrada soils have a thick mollic epipedon and occur on footslopes and toeslopes.  Esquila soils are clayey, shallow to sandstone bedrock, and occur on toeslopes of plateaus.  Sabroso soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on steep south-facing backslopes.  Verano soils are loamy-skeletal, have a mollic epipedon, and occur on steep north-facing backslopes."
