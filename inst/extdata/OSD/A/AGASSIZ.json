  "OVERVIEW": "The Agassiz series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderate or moderately rapidly permeable soils on mountain slopes.  They formed in colluvium over limestone.  Slope ranges from 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about  20 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 70 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years.  The soil moisture regime is typic xeric.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from 7 to 19 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact is 7 to 20 inches.  The rock fragments are dominantly limestone but also include calcareous quartzite, calcareous sandstone, and dolomite.  These soils are generally noncalcareous but are slightly calcareous to moderately calcareous in spots in some pedons. The particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay and is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent by volume in the upper A horizon and 35 to 80 percent in the lower horizon and may contain up to 10 percent stones. The A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very cobbly or cobbly silt loam or silty clay loam to extremely stony loam.  Structure is weak to moderate, fine to medium, subangular blocky or granular.  A thin C horizon occurs between the A horizon and the bedrock in some pedons."

Alomax, Dipcreek, Gando, Grink Hogsby and Van Wagoner soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Anatone, Foxol, Little Pole and Swanner soils have cambic horizons.  Bluecanyon soils formed in igneous rock and contain less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, Bocker soils have cambic horizons and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Falula soils have Bk horizons and are moderately calcareous to strongly calcareous.  Gomine soils have a cambic horizon and  are dry for more than 60 consecutive days, Kenypeak soil aren't in the OSD file, Nayrib soils contain 12 to 18 percent clay and are are less than 10 inches to bedrock.  Onaqui soils formed in quartzite and the clay range is 18 to 27 percent, Rexmont soils are calcareous in the lower horizon and are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

They are on strongly sloping and very steep, dominantly south and west-facing mountain slopes with gradients of 4 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium over fractured, weathering limestone.  The climate is moist subhumid or humid, the average annual precipitation is about 16 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 31 to 47 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F. Freeze-free period is 30 to 100 days."
