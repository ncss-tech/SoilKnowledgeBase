    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The particle-size control section averages between 20 and 30 percent clay and has less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  There are no coarse fragments throughout the pedon.  The solum and substratum is medium acid or mildly alkaline.  The A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bg1 horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Common or many distinct or prominent mottles of high chroma are in this horizon but typically they are less than 20 percent of the volume.\nThe Bg2 or Bg3 horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 through 3 or it is neutral.  Common or many distinct or prominent mottles of high chroma occupy less than about 30 percent of the horizon.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Cg horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5BG, 5B, or 5G hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral.  Some pedons have thin lenses of silt loam or silty clay in the C horizon."

Evansville soils do not have red mottles in the B horizon and bluish gray or greenish gray colors at depths of less than 40 inches.  Boaz soils have darker surfaces, are less gray in their sola, and do not have bluish gray or greenish gray silty clay loam in thin C horizons above a depth of 40 inches.  Ettrick soils have mollic epipedons.  Lawson soils have mollic epipedons and do not have dominantly gray colors.  Orion soils are less gray in color and have buried mollic epipedons within the series control section."

Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent, but some are as much as 3 percent.  The regolith consists of alluvial silty deposits over massive, bluish gray or greenish gray silty clay loam slack-water deposits.  They are in depressions or old oxbows.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degreess F, and mean annual precipitation from 29 to 35 inches."
