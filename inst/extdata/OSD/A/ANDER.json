  "OVERVIEW": "The Ander series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone in the Goliad Formation.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on footslopes of low hills on an inland dissected coastal plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in).",
