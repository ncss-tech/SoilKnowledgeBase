  "OVERVIEW": "The Attica series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments . These soils are on dunes on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual precipitation is 28 inches (71 centimeters), and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",
