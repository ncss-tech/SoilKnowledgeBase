  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Ailey series were formerly classified as Fragiudults. The pedogenic firmness and brittleness of the Btx horizon is not as extensive as in a fragipan. The dense and compact properties of the Cd horizon are root-restrictive but are not thought to be pedogenic. Reclassification to Hapludults was recommended by the Coastal Plains-Dense Soils Properties Study, February 23, 1982. Classification was changed to Kanhapludults as agreed to October 29, 1987 at the SNTC State Soil Scientist meeting. The volume of brittleness was revised (2005) from 10 to 40 percent to 30 to 60 percent to reflect the range common to the fragic subgroup.\nThe central concept of Ailey soils, are to have significant fragic soil properties as to affect water movement and root penetration but not as significant to classify as a fragipan. It is anticipated with the next revision to Soil Taxonomy the series Great group will be changed to Arenic Fragic Kanhapludults. The present range in soil properties allows for Ailey soils to have a perched seasonal water table from four to six feet or below six feet. Additional study is needed to determine if these soils are interpretatively similar and have the same basic soil properties. Ultimately, it is anticipated Ailey soils will be split into two series; one with densic materials and a perched water table (episaturation) and one without the Cd layer with an apparent water table (endosaturation).\nDiagnostic horizons, soil characteristics, and special features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 24 inches (A, E horizons)\nArenic feature--sandy texture from 0 to 24 inches (A, E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 29 to 50 inches (Bt, Btx horizons)\nKandic horizon--the zone from 29 to 50 inches (Bt, Btx horizons)\nFragic soil properties--the zone from 36 to 50 inches (Btx horizon)\nDensic contact--the contact with densic materials at a depth of 50 inches\nDensic materials--the zone from 50 to 80 inches (2Cd horizon)\nLithologic discontinuity--contrasting sand sizes starting at a depth of 50 inches (2Cd horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nReference sample data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE; pedon numbers: 87NC153002 and 87NC153003.\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--468548\nUser Pedon ID--To be completed\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
