  "OVERVIEW": "The Appleseed series consists of shallow and very shallow somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone on mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 74 degrees F.",
