  "OVERVIEW": "The Annemaine series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on large stream and river terraces that are subject to flooding in the Southern Coastal Plain. They formed in stratified clayey and loamy fluvial sediments. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

A seasonal high water table ranging from 16 to 30 inches below the surface is present in the late winter and spring of most years.\nAnnemaine soils were included with the Craven series or Craven-red subsoil-variant.
