Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Some pedons have an upper Bt horizon, less than 7 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow and red range from none to common. Iron depletions in shades of gray, within the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon, range from few to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay with an average of 35 percent or more clay content in the control section.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has the same range in hue, value and chroma as the Bt horizon; or it is multicolored in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.

Soils in related families include Craven, Eulonia, Maubila and Sacul. The somewhat poorly drained Beason soils have yellower subsoils.  Buckatunna soils are on lower adjacent positions and have yellower subsoils. Bush River soils have yellower subsoils, are deep to bedrock and are on uplands of the Southern Piedmont (MLRA 136). Chickasawhay soils are on higher adjacent positions and are not subject to flooding. Cid soils have yellower subsoils, are moderately deep to argillite and are on uplands of MLRA 136. Creedmoor soils have upper B horizons of friable loamy materials over clayey lower B horizons and are on uplands in MLRA 136. Dogue soils are in similar positions in Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 153A) and Tidewater Area (MLRA 153B). Dorian soils have yellower subsoils and are on similar positions in MLRA 136. Gritney soils are on uplands and have less than 30 percent silt in the control section. Helena soils are on uplands of MLRA 136. Lignum soils have yellower subsoils and are deep to weathered bedrock, and are on uplands of MLRA 136. Nemours soils are not subject to flooding. Newco soils have no mica flakes and are on uplands of the Willis Formation in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. Prosperity soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on uplands of MLRA 136. Telfair soils are moderately deep to sandstone and are on uplands. Wolftever soils have yellower subsoils. Craven soils are in the subactive activity class, have yellower subsoils and are not subject to flooding. Eulonia soils are in the subactive activity class and are not subject to flooding. Maubila soils are in the subactive activity class, are on non flooding uplands and have significant amounts of iron stone flags and channers on the surface and upper subsoil.

Slopes are dominantly 0 to 5 percent but range up to 12 percent.  They formed in stratified clayey and loamy sediments.  The climate is humid semitropical. Near the type location, the average annual temperature of 65 degrees F. and average annual precipitation of 53 inches."

Angie soils have yellower subsoils that are more than 60 inches thick.  The well drained Bassfield and Cahaba soils are on higher adjacent positions and have coarse-loamy and fine-loamy control sections respectively.  The well drained Canton Bend soils have base saturation greater than 35 percent.  Izagora soils are on similar positions, have yellower subsoils and are fine-loamy.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 9 inches (Ap and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from about 9 inches to 37 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nAquic feature - Iron depletions with moist color value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less in the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon. A seasonal high water table ranging from 16 to 30 inches below the surface is present in the late winter and spring of most years.\nAnnemaine soils were included with the Craven series or Craven-red subsoil-variant.  The Annemaine series is restricted to hues of 5YR or redder and clayey Bt horizons with high Ca and Mg content in these horizons.\nAnnemaine soils are in MLRA 133A.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for the typical pedon were obtained by the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station. Sample No. S71AL066013 (1-7).\nThe following laboratory characterization data is available on the NSSL website: S86AL105004 (1-6).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
