  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Antero soils typically are calcareous throughout but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in most of the control section, and there are no subhorizons more than 4 inches thick above a depth of 20 inches that exceed 15 percent.  Depth to continuous concentrated horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  The control section is usually sandy loam but ranges from 5 to 80 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Loamy fine sand or coarser textures are excluded from the above range.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the control section and are typically less than 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.\nThe B2g horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  The Ccag horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Antero soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial parent materials derived from a variety of rock sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 61 degrees F."
