They are separated based on soil moisture control section (typic/ustic vs. udic/ustic), and reaction of the subsoil.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 24 to 44 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 24 inches.  (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 24 to 80 inches.  (Bt and 2Bt horizons)\nPale feature: clay content does not decrease from the maximum clay content by as much as 20 percent within 60 inches of the surface.\nRedoximorphic concentrations and depletions: 24 to 80 inches, corresponding to the argillic horizon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in geographically associated areas.\nTaxonomic version:  Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
