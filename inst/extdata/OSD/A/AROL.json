  "OVERVIEW": "The Arol series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey residuum weathered from tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone of the Catahoula formation of Miocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad, upland ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 to 1232 mm (35 to 49 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.4 to 21.1 degrees C (65 to 70 degrees F).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils do not have an aquic moisture regime. Classification change from Typic Albaqualfs is due to interpretation that the low chroma matrix is due to organic matter accumulations in conjunction with gray colored parent material. Field observations, water table studies from Texas A&M University, landscape position and climate indicate the soil is typically not saturated long enough to be reduced in most years. Arol soils were formerly included in the Wilson series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon-0 to 15 cm (6 in) Ap horizon\nAbrupt textural change from A to Bt horizon 15 cm (6 in)\nArgillic horizon-15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in)\nRedox depletions with chroma 2 or less - 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in)\nParalithic Contact-at depth of 76 cm (30 in) weakly cemented tuff\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL Data from type location - 70TX471004; Representative pedon for series - P1979TX4719501\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
