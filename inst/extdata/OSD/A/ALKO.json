  "OVERVIEW": "The Alko series consists of shallow or very shallow over a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from ignimbrite, granodiorite and basalt. Alko soils are on fan piedmonts and have slopes that range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
