    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Alko soils are on fan piedmonts and relict alluvial flats.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived commonly from ignimbrite, granodiorite and basalt, but components from quartzite, limestone, dolomite and shale are included in some areas.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 2400 to 5500 feet.  The climate is hot and arid.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 10 inches; mean annual temperature is 58 to 67 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 175 to 250 days."
