  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Antung soils are in shallow closed depressions primarily on outwash plains, lake plains, lake terraces, and flood plains, but can occur within moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Antung soils formed in a thin layer of herbaceous organic material overlying sandy deposits. Typically the adjacent soils are sandy.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 427 meters (580 to 1,400 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adrian, Edselton, Gilford, Granby, Houghton, Madaus, and Newton soils. The very poorly drained Adrian, Edselton, Houghton, and Madaus soils are on similar landform positions as the Antung soils. Adrian and Houghton soils formed in more than 41 cm (16 inches) of herbaceous organic deposits. Edselton and Madaus soils are underlain by marl and sand. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Granby soils, and the very poorly drained Newton soils are sandy or loamy throughout, and generally are at the margins of depressions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Where these soils are on flood plains the water table may be more that 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface when the associated stream overflows its banks. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic material and high or very high in the sandy material. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material and rapid in the sandy material."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are drained and used for cultivated crops. Common crops include corn and soybeans, with small areas in mint, hay and pasture. Undrained areas are in native vegetation. Native vegetation is marsh grasses such as sedges and reeds; and shrubs and trees such as willow, cottonwood, and soft maple."

Drained and undrained phases are recognized.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 152934 represents the drained phase and is the typical pedon.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 152935 represents the undrained phase.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S99IN-131-003) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T99IN-131-020) is on file in the MLRA project office in Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 90 percent Antung and 10 percent Madaus soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
