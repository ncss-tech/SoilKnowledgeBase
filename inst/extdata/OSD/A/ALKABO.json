Depth to glacial till ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates typically ranges from 15 to 30 inches but ranges to 50 inches in some pedons.  The upper lacustrine sediments have 0 to 2 percent coarse fragments and the glacial till 2C horizon has 2 to 10 percent coarse fragments of mixed lithology.  A thin lag line ranging up to 6 inches thick and containing up to 30 percent coarse fragments is at the contact between the two sediments in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btkn horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.
