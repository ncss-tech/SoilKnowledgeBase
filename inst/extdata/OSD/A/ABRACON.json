  "OVERVIEW": "The Abracon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestoneand quartzite.  Abracon soils are on fan remnants, hills, toeslopes, or mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
