  "OVERVIEW": "The Automba series consists of deep well and moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy glacial till on glacial moraines and drumlins.  These soils have moderately slow permeability.  Their slopes range from 1 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Thickness of the upper sequum ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 12 percent in the upper sequum and from 4 to 15 percent in the lower sequum.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 44 degrees F.\nA thin O horizon is in some pedons.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have a discontinuous A2 horizon with a maximum thickness of about 2 inches.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It is very strongly to medium acid.\nThe B horizon in the upper sequum has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles are lacking in this horizon in some pedons.  The lower value or chroma or both are only in the upper part.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam and ranges from very strongly to medium acid.\nSome pedons have a thin A2 horizon immediately below the B horizon.  In the A&B horizon the A2 material has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 and is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  High chroma mottles commonly are present.  The A2 horizon or material tongues into the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR with value and chroma of 3 or 4.  High chroma mottles commonly are in the upper part of this horizon.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam and contains 12 to 18 percent clay.  The Bt horizon ranges from medium to slightly acid in the upper part and slightly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Bulk density in the C horizon ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 g/cc."

The Parent soils are poorly drained and have a moderately thick black A horizon and have nearly level slopes.  The somewhat poorly drained Ronneby soils have nearly level slopes.  The very poorly drained Twig soils have a mucky surface layer and have concave slopes.  The well drained Ahmeek and Duluth soils are associated in some places.
