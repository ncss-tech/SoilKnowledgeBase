  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearvalley series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in coarse textured alluvium derived from dominantly serpentinitic minerals. Bearvalley soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes are 2 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
