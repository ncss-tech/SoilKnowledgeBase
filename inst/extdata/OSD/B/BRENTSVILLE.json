    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of rounded quartz gravel and sandstone fragments range from 2 to 35 percent in the A horizon, and from 2 to 40 percent in the Bt horizon.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, with value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nWhere present, the Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5 YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through lOR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through lOR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, or loam, in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is dense-in-place but well-weathered red acid sandstone that can be dug with hand tools.\nThe R horizon is hard red acid Triassic sandstone not removable with hand equipment."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dunellen, Lansdale and Rigley.  The Dunellen soils are more than 48 inches to bedrock and are developed in stratified materials on glacial outwash plains and stream terraces.  The Lansdale soils have bedrock more than 40 inches deep and formed in residuum weathered from Arkosic sandstone and conglomerate.  The Rigley soils have bedrock more than 60 inches deep and formed in colluvium from sandstone and siltstone."

Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils are formed in residuum of weathered, red, acid sandstones and conglomerate sandstone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F.; the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."
