  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Brentsville Series are moderately deep and well drained.  They formed in materials that weathered from Triassic acid sandstones.  They are on ridgetops, shoulders, and backslopes on dissected landscapes of the rim of the Culpeper Basin of the Northern part of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and annual precipitation is about 41 inches.",

Rock fragments of rounded quartz gravel and sandstone fragments range from 2 to 35 percent in the A horizon, and from 2 to 40 percent in the Bt horizon.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, with value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nWhere present, the Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5 YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through lOR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through lOR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, or loam, in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is dense-in-place but well-weathered red acid sandstone that can be dug with hand tools.\nThe R horizon is hard red acid Triassic sandstone not removable with hand equipment."

The Dunellen soils are more than 48 inches to bedrock and are developed in stratified materials on glacial outwash plains and stream terraces.  The Lansdale soils have bedrock more than 40 inches deep and formed in residuum weathered from Arkosic sandstone and conglomerate.  The Rigley soils have bedrock more than 60 inches deep and formed in colluvium from sandstone and siltstone."
