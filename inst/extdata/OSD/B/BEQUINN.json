The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F.  These soils are dry in all parts 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is warmer than 41 degrees F.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist.  The upper part is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  The lower part is extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sand."

The soils formed in colluvium derived mainly from conglomerate composed of sandstone, limestone and quartzite.  The climate is arid.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F.; the mean summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.; and the frost free season is 50 to 65 days."
