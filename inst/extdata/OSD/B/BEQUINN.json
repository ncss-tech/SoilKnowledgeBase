  "OVERVIEW": "The Bequinn series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from conglomerate.  These soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

These soils are dry in all parts 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is warmer than 41 degrees F.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist.  The upper part is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  The lower part is extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sand."
