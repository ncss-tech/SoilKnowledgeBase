  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the fill material ranges from 20 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid except where the surface has been limed.  Coarse fragments of quartz and ironstone range from 0 to 3 percent by volume in all horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Mottles in shades of yellow or brown are present in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 or it has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 2 to 8.  Soil colors are generally contrasting from layer to layer.  Low chroma colors are not indicative of wetness but a condition of the original soil.  The C horizon is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages from 18 to 35 percent clay.  Underlying horizons are variable in colors and texture."

The soil formed from materials that have been cut and filled and graded or smoothed for firing ranges, recreational areas, earthen runways, and adjacent areas.  The mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches near the type location."
