  "OVERVIEW": "The Birdow series consists of very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils.  These soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks on alluvial fans, in drainageways and flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.",

The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 41 inches thick.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent below a depth of about 20 inches and is slightly higher below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR dominantly, but ranges to 5YR, value is 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from loam to fine sandy loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has 5 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam or gravelly loam.  It is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nBuried A horizons occur in some pedons."

Blackrock soils are high in content of volcanic ash.  Coit soils are poorly drained.  Dagor, Goose Creek, and Soquel soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Eastcan soils have mottles within 25 to 40 inches.  Goosenawt soils are noncalcareous to 35 inches.  Gosinta soils are moderately well drained and have mottles.  Lakeview soils are noncalcareous in the A and B horizons.  Monroe soils have 0 to 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout.  Oxy soils are moderately deep to basalt.  Shoepeg soils are somewhat poorly drained and noncalcareous in the solum.  Willowdale soils have a layer of secondary carbonate accumulation and have 10 to 20 percent pumice sand in the particle size control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone of from the soil surface to a depth of about 30 inches (A horizons).\nCumulic feature - the mollic epipedon is greater than 20 inches thick and the soil has either an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth or the organic carbon content remains high at depth.\nThe 8/88 version of the series stated the moisture regime was Xeric in the remarks but the limits in the range in characteristics met the definition of Aridic.  The dry matter production of 1200 to 1500 pounds per acre and the precipitation range of 12 to 16 inches per year indicates that the Birdow series is not in an aridic moisture regime.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
