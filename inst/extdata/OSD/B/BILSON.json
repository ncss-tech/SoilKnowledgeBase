  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to siliceous sandy alluvium range from 20 to 40 inches.  Typically these soils have no coarse fragments, but the volume of sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy mantle but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the sandy alluvium.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt or 2BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy sand or sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Typically, a few thin strata of sandy loam or loamy sand are in the 2C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Bilmod and Silverhill series. Similar soils are the Billett and Hoop series.  Bilmod soils have redox features and an apparent seasonal high water table.  Silverhill soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Billett soils have 10 percent or more weatherable minerals.  Hoop soils have a mollic epipedon and have redox features and an apparent seasonal high water table."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bilmod soils are on pediments or stream terraces, or both.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in siliceous loamy alluvium underlain by siliceous sandy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 680 to 1100 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bilmod, Gardenvale, Hoop, Merimod, Merit, Silverhill, and Sooner soils.  The moderately well drained Bilmod soils and the somewhat poorly drained Hoop soils form a drainage sequence with Bilson soils.  Gardenvale and Silverhill soils are nearby on sandstone bedrock controlled uplands or terraces where there is sandstone bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.  The well drained Merit soils, the moderately well drained Merimod soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Sooner soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is more clay and less sand in the soil."
