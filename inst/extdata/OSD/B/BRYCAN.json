The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 to 47 degrees F.  and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 to 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chromas of 2 to 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  This horizon lacks the clay increase to qualify for an argillic horizon.\nThe BC and 2Bkb horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and is gravelly below 30 inches in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Enbar soils lack cambic horizons.  Frolic soils have mottles in the series control section and water tables at 3 to 5 feet.  Jodero, Mitch, and Nutrioso soils lack cambic horizons.  Also, Jodero soils have mollic epipedons more than 40 inches thick and Nutrioso soils have chroma of 1 or 2 throughout.  McGaffey soils lack cambic horizons and have hue redder than 7.5YR.  Straw soils lack cambic horizons and have chroma of 2 or less in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in deep alluvium from limestone, sandstone, and shale.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The average annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F. and the freeze-free period is 70 to 110 days."
