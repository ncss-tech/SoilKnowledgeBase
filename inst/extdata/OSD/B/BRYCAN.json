  "OVERVIEW": "The Brycan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Brycan soils are on alluvial fans and valley floors and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  This horizon lacks the clay increase to qualify for an argillic horizon.\nThe BC and 2Bkb horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and is gravelly below 30 inches in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
