  "STATES": "AR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonnerdale series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments over weakly cemented, tilted shale with thin strata of interbedded sandstone.  These soils are on uplands along the southern edge of the Ouachita Mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to tilted shale ranges from 40 to more than 72 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout except for surface layers where limed.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the A, BE, and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Mottles are in shades of brown.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Mottles are in shades of brown or gray.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 5 and chroma of 4 to 8 with mottles in shades of gray; or it is mottled horizon in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy loam in the upper part, but ranges to sandy clay loam in the lower part.  Subhorizons are brittle in 15 to 35 percent of the mass in most pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 and mottles in shades of brown or red; or it is mottled horizon in shades of gray, brown, and red.  It is generally quite variable in short distances.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay or with their gravelly or shaly analogs.  Coarse fragments of shale and sandstone range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe 2Cr horizon is gray, brown and red, soft, weakly cemented, acid shale with few thin strata of interbedded sandstone.  Fine-earth material is less than 5 percent of the volume.  Beds are fractured and dip ranges from 25 degrees to near vertical.  Hardness of this material on Mohs' scale ranges from 1.5 to 3.0."

Nansemond soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within 72 inches of the soil surface.  Munden soils are in a mixed mineralogy class.  Hammonton soils, have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.  Altavista soils are in a mixed mineralogy class and are in a fine-loamy particle size class.

The soil formed in loamy sediments over soft tilted, interbedded shale and sandstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent, but is dominantly less than 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F and the annual precipitation is about 52 inches near the type location."

Bismarck soils, which are on valley floors and lower sideslopes, are in a loamy-skeletal particle size class and are less than 20 inches deep to soft interbedded shale and sandstone.  Carnasaw soils, which are on sideslopes, are in a clayey particle size class and are better drained.  Pirum soils, which are on ridges, are in a fine-loamy particle size class and are 22 to 50 inches deep over hard sandstone.  Sherless soils, which are on ridges and sideslopes, are in a fine-loamy particle size class and are 20 to 40 inches deep over soft sandstone."
