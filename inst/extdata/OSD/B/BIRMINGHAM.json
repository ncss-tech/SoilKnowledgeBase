  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact of reddish sandstone is 40 to more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid throughout.  Content of coarse fragments, mainly flagstones and channers of ironstone and sandstone, ranges from 35 to 60 percent throughout the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very flaggy or very channery loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is very flaggy or very channery clay loam or loam.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered sandstone and ironstone.  It commonly is thinly bedded and can be dug, with difficulty, with hand tools or light equipment.\nThe R horizon is extremely hard, massive sandstone."

These soils formed in loamy residuum weathered from reddish sandstone and ironstone.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barfield, Bodine, Fullerton, Hector, and Nauvoo series.  Barfield and Hector soils are in positions similar to those of the Birmingham series and are shallow to hard bedrock.  The very deep Bodine and Fullerton soils are on side slopes and have a significant content of chert fragments throughout the profile.  Nauvoo soils are fine-loamy and are on side slopes."

Engineering test data is also available.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
