(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)\n^Oi -- 0 to 38 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) slightly decomposed plant material; 85 percent slightly decomposed needles and branches and 15 percent wood chips, a total of which 65 percent are greater than 20 mm in diameter; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; abrupt smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the organic fill materials ranges from 25 to 50 cm thick. The human transported organic material may be any organic material, but is dominantly wood chips. The human transported organic material is mainly fibric material that has undergone minimal decomposition. Consistence is loose.\nThe ^Oi horizon has hue 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 6. It has single grain or massive structure and is defined by minimally decomposed organic soil materials. Reaction is expected to be Dysic family, although at minimal levels of decomposition this can be difficult to measure. Windblown sand may be present.\nThe 2^M horizon is asphalt, concrete, or other continuously cemented anthropogenic material. Dry consistence is rigid and the material is weatherable only over extended periods of time.\nThe 3^C horizon has hue 10YR to 5Y, value 4 to 6, and chroma 1 to 6. It is commonly sand or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 34 percent; artifacts range from 0 to 10 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bulkhead soils are on nearly level slopes of artificially created or modified landforms. The human transported soil is relatively clean of artifacts and natural rock fragments. The human transported organic soil material is dominantly wood chips. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The microtopography in these units can undulate extremely over short distances depending on whether the organic fill was leveled after deposition. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 125 cm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 17 degrees C."

Shea (T) soils form in mineral human transported soil materials over the M horizon."

Fibric soil material - the 0 to 20 38 centimeter zone has 85 percent slightly decomposed and 15 percent undecomposed wood chips.\n2.Folistic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 38 centimeters (^Oi horizon).\n3. Thermic temperature class is estimated due to a high rate of organic matter decomposition. However, rate of organic matter decomposition may decrease over time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
