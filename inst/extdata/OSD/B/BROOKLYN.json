  "OVERVIEW": "The Brooklyn series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils on nearly level or depressional parts of loess covered outwash plains, till plains, and stream terraces. They formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches).",

Slope gradients commonly are less than one percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in 91 to 140 cm (36 to 55 inches) of loess and in the underlying stratified outwash, of Wisconsinan Age. The dominant clay mineral in the loess is smectite, and the outwash and underlying till is illite. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1219 mm (32 to 38 inches), frost free days range from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Blackberry soils, the somewhat poorly drained Brenton soils and the well drained Plano soils have mollic epipedons and are on higher parts of the landform nearby. Drummer soils have a mollic epipedon and contain less clay in the control section and are on lower lying parts of the landform nearby. The somewhat poorly drained Flanagan soils are on the till plain above the Brooklyn soils. The somewhat poorly drained Millbrook soils contain less clay in the control section and are higher on the landform than Brooklyn soils. Thorp soils have a mollic epipedon and do not have an abrupt textural change from the E horizon to the Bt horizon. They are in similar positions nearby."

Where drained, a perched seasonal high water table is within 31 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In the undrained condition, the perched seasonal high water table is within 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. These soils are subject to ponding of about 15 cm (0.5 foot) after heavy rains from November through June.  The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to moderately low (4.23 to 0.42 micrometers per second). The Permeability is moderately slow or slow."
