Cowden, Denny, and Smileyville soils average less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brooklyn soils are on nearly level and depressional parts of loess-covered outwash plains, till plains, and stream terraces. Slope gradients commonly are less than one percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in 91 to 140 cm (36 to 55 inches) of loess and in the underlying stratified outwash, of Wisconsinan Age. The dominant clay mineral in the loess is smectite, and the outwash and underlying till is illite. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1219 mm (32 to 38 inches), frost free days range from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackberry, Brenton, Drummer, Flanagan, Millbrook, Plano, and Thorp soils. The moderately well drained Blackberry soils, the somewhat poorly drained Brenton soils and the well drained Plano soils have mollic epipedons and are on higher parts of the landform nearby. Drummer soils have a mollic epipedon and contain less clay in the control section and are on lower lying parts of the landform nearby. The somewhat poorly drained Flanagan soils are on the till plain above the Brooklyn soils. The somewhat poorly drained Millbrook soils contain less clay in the control section and are higher on the landform than Brooklyn soils. Thorp soils have a mollic epipedon and do not have an abrupt textural change from the E horizon to the Bt horizon. They are in similar positions nearby."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Where drained, a perched seasonal high water table is within 31 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In the undrained condition, the perched seasonal high water table is within 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. These soils are subject to ponding of about 15 cm (0.5 foot) after heavy rains from November through June.  The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to moderately low (4.23 to 0.42 micrometers per second). The Permeability is moderately slow or slow."

Soil cracking is not evident and available data suggests that the LE to 1 meter is insufficient to qualify as Vertic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches) (Ap and Eg horizons);\nalbic horizon - the zone from 23 to 36 cm (9 to 14 inches) (Eg horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 36 to 132 cm (14 inches to about 52 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, 2Btg4, and 2Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
