    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bane soils are on alluvial fans at the mouth of steep canyons.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  They formed in recent deposits of granitic alluvium.  Elevations range from 1,500 to 2,700 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  The average frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Farnhamton, Ritz and Schnoorson soils.  Farnhamton soils are on natural levees and have coarse-silty control sections and are moderately well drained.  Ritz soils are on low stream terraces and plane to convex areas of flood plains, and have coarse-silty control sections and are poorly drained.  Schnoorson soils are on swales and concave areas on flood plains and have fine-silty control sections and are poorly drained."
