  "OVERVIEW": "The Bane series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on alluvial fans.  They formed in granitic alluvium.  Permeability is rapid.  Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",

The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  The average frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Farnhamton soils are on natural levees and have coarse-silty control sections and are moderately well drained.  Ritz soils are on low stream terraces and plane to convex areas of flood plains, and have coarse-silty control sections and are poorly drained.  Schnoorson soils are on swales and concave areas on flood plains and have fine-silty control sections and are poorly drained."
