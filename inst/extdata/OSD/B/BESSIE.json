  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the Oa horizon ranges from 16 to 40 inches, but is usually less than 30 inches.  Soil reaction in the Oa horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral in 0.01M calcium chloride.  Reaction in the 2C horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline, and from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline in the 3C horizon.\nThe Oa horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2.  This horizon is sapric and the content of fine mineral material ranges from 40 to 70 percent.  Texture is muck.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value 2 to 4, and chroma 1 or 2.  Pockets of organic material range from few to common.  Pockets or lenses of coarser materials range from none to common.  Texture is clay or sandy clay.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Shell fragments range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam."

Allemands series are in fresh water environments and have less than 3 dS/m in the control section.  Bellpass soils are in similar positions and have less 16 dS/m in the control section.  Clovelly soils are in similar positions but have less than 8 dS/m in the control section"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bessie soils are in tidal mangrove swamps in protected salt water or brackish water areas along the Indian River, the Intracoastal Waterway, and coastal tributary streams.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  They formed in marine deposits of organic material over clayey sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 76 degrees F."
