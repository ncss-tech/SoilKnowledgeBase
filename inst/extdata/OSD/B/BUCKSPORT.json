  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the organic material is greater than 130 cm, and ranges to over 4 meters. Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Fibers are typically of herbaceous and woody origin, but in some pedons fibers from sphagnum moss compose up to 70 percent of the surface tier, and thin layers in the subsurface and bottom tiers.\nWoody fragments consisting of twigs, branches, and stumps range from 0 to 20 percent throughout the soil. The content of mineral material ranges from 0 to 20 percent throughout.\nThe surface tier is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is typically sapric material, but in some pedons it is hemic or fibric material with or without sapric material. Consistence is nonsticky or slightly sticky. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in 0.01M calcium chloride.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. They are typically sapric material, but some pedons have layers of fibric material with a total thickness of less than 15 cm, or layers of hemic material with a total thickness of less than 25 cm. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the subsurface tier, and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the bottom tier (in 0.01M calcium chloride)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bucksport soils are primarily in swamps in glaciated uplands and lowlands. They also occur on floodplains. The soils formed in organic material greater than 130 cm thick. The organic material is derived mainly from herbaceous and woody plants with lesser amounts of sphagnum moss. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from about 5 to 800 meters above mean sea level."

With the exception of Wonsqueak soils, all of these soils are better drained and formed in mineral soil material. Wonsqueak soils are very poorly drained and formed in organic soil material 40 to 130 cm thick over mineral soil material."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are in swamps. Some are in shrubby or open bogs. Woodland vegetation includes northern white cedar, tamarack, black spruce, alder, red maple, gray birch, and balsam fir. Shrubby plants and understory vegetation include pale laurel, bog rosemary, labrador tea, lambkill, leatherleaf, chokeberry, sphagnum moss, and various grasses and sedges."
