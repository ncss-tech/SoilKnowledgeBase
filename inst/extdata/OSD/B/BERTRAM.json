  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bertram series consists of moderately deep, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of oxidized and leached sandy loam eolian material and in the underlying residuum from limestone.  These soils occur on convex summits of interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 fegrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters (35 inches).",
