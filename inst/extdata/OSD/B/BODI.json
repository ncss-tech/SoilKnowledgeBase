  "OVERVIEW": "The Bodi series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till.  These soils are on ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and very slow in the lower solum and substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
