Stony and wooded phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1; however, chroma of 2 is allowed below the Ap.  It typically is a loam but includes fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, and cobbly loam.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has 10 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedon have redoximorphic features that may or may not be relict.\nSome pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Some pedons do not have redoximorphic features.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
