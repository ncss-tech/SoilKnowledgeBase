    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 18 to 40 cm thick. The particle-size control section is loam or clay loam and contains up to 10 percent by volume of rock fragments.  It has more than 30 percent total sand and more than 20 percent fine sand and coarser sand.  Stony and wooded phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1; however, chroma of 2 is allowed below the Ap.  It typically is a loam but includes fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, and cobbly loam.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has 10 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedon have redoximorphic features that may or may not be relict.\nSome pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Some pedons do not have redoximorphic features.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Doland soils have less than 20 percent fine sand and coarser sand in the upper part of the series control section. Edgeley soils have a relatively high shale content and have bedded shale within 100 cm.  Formdale soils contain less than 30 percent total sand in the particle-size control section.  Hibar soils are moderately deep to sandstone.  Vienna soils have silty upper horizons.  Yeoman soils have hues redder than 10YR and occur at higher elevations."

Buse soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Langhei soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Forman soils are on similar positions to Barnes.  They have an argillic horizon. Hamerly, Parnell and Tonka soils are on lower lying foot slopes and flats and in depressions.  They are wetter and have water tables at or near the surface."
