    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches or are noncalcareous for a least the upper 3 inches of the C horizon if the solum exceeds 40 inches. Base saturation ranges from 40 to 100 percent with some subhorizon of the argillic horizon being less than 60 percent base saturated. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum, but increases with depth and exceed 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon. These are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter. The majority of subhorizons above 50 inches have hue of 5YR or redder. Some pedons have at depths of 30 inches or less few faint mottles with the chroma of both matrix and mottles exceeding 2. These soils are dry in some part at some time in most years and are restricted to areas having peak periods of precipitation.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 8, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. it ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 , 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is typically heavy clay loam or clay but clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent, silt from 5 to 50 percent, and sand from 10 to 55 percent with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand. This horizon ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR. It is typically stony or very stony clay or heavy clay loam but clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent, silt from 5 to 50 percent, and sand 10 to 55 percent. This horizon ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

Chubbs, Roxton, McVickers and Wetterhorn soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches. Gateway, Hatch and Mikesell soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches. Cowdrey and Dell soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in a majority of subhorizons in the solum and C horizon above 50 inches.  Muggins and Nokhu soils have greater than 60 percent base saturation in the Bt horizon and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of calcareous in the lower part of the solum or in the C horizons, and have horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bead soils are on hills, ridges, and mountainsides. Slopes typically range from about 2 to 50 percent. The\nsoil formed in thick noncalcareous, moderately fine to fine textured materials originating as slope wash from sedimentary and igneous bedrock. At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and summer months. Mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 55 degrees F."
