  "OVERVIEW": "The Bead series consists of deep, well to moderately well drained, slowly to very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick noncalcareous, moderately fine to fine textured materials originating as slope wash from sedimentary and igneous rocks. These soils are on hills, ridges, and mountainsides with slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
