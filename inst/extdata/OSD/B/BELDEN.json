    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 45 to more than 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bg1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2; mottles, if present, are few to common in shades of brown; or the horizon is mottled in shades of brown and gray.  The Bg2 and Bg3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 with few to many mottles in shades of brown and red.  The B horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  The particle-size control section, the 10-to 40-inch section is 25 to 35 percent clay, 40 to 60 percent\nsilt, and 5 to 25 percent sand, which mostly is very fine sand.  The upper part of the B horizon is medium acid or slightly acid, and the lower part of the B horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Black concretions, if present, are few to many in the B subhorizons."

Commerce soils have a solum ranging from 20 to 40 inches thick, and the control section is slightly acid to moderate alkaline.  Arkabutla and Mathison soils are very strongly acid or strongly acid in the 10- to 40-inch control section; also, Mathiston soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Bruin and Keo soils have a coarse-silty particle-size class.  Marietta soils do not have a grayish matrix in the upper part of the B\nhorizon and have a fine-loamy particle-size class."

The soil formed in silty and loamy alluvial sediment.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual precipitation is 51 inches, and mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F near the type location."

These soils on nearly level flood plains.  Catalpa, Leeper, and Tuscumbia soils have a fine particle-size class.  Moderately well drained Catalpa soils are in slightly higher positions.  Somewhat poorly drained Leeper soils are in similar positions as the Bleden soils, and the poorly drained Tuscumbia soils are in depressions and backswamps."
