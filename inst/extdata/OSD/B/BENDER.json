  "OVERVIEW": "The Bender series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone. These soils are on gently sloping to very steep uplands. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
