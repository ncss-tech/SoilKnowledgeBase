  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

They formed in residuum from sandstone. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Bendavis soils, and the Hogcreek, Lecoma and Poynor soils. Bendavis soils have less sand throughout the profile and are on similar positions. Hogcreek soils are on ridgetops, have less sand and fewer coarse fragments throughout the profile. Lecoma soils are very deep and occur on foot slopes. Poynor soils are very deep and are on shoulder slopes."
