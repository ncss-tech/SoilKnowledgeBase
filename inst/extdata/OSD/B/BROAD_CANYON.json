    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on lateral moraines or glaciated mountainsides at elevations of 1,980 or 2,960 meters.  In the southern part of Idaho, these soils formed in granite or limestone colluvium and occur on north-facing mountain slopes down to elevations of 1,520 meters. Slopes range from 20 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in materials weathered mainly from quartzite, sandstone, limestone and some shale.  Average annual temperature is 0.6 to 7.2 degrees C and the average summer temperature is 10.0 to 14.4 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.  Average annual precipitation is 635 to 1250 mm. Soil moisture regime is Udic."

Agassiz, Elder Hollow, and Foxol soils have bedrock at depths less than 50 cm.  Kiesel soils have natric horizons.  Ledgefork soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and lack cambic horizons.  Lucky Star soils have E horizons and argillic horizons.  Moweba and Poleline soils have mollic epipedons more than 50 cm thick.  Norway Flat soils have argillic horizons with the upper boundary at depths below 61 cm.  Agassiz and Foxol soils are generally on south and west-facing slopes.  The other associated soils are on positions similar to Broad Canyon soils."
