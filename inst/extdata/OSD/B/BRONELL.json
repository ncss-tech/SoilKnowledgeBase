  "OVERVIEW": "The Bronell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on terraces, mountain hill slopes, ridges, and toe slopes and foot slopes.  Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F.  The depth to secondary calcium carbonate is 6 to 15 inches.  The moisture control section is dry in most years in some part; more than one-half the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  However, in most years it is moist in some part for 60 or more consecutive days in early spring, summer, and early fall.  It is also dry for less than 60 cumulative days during the first 90 days following the winter solstice.  About equal amounts of precipitation are received each month while the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Rock fragment content of the particle-size control section ranges from 30 to 65 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It generally has a calcium carbonate equivalent content greater than 20 percent, but ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  The fine earth fraction is sandy clay loam or sandy loam, but thin strata of loam also are present in some pedons.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent in the particle-size control section, silt from 10 to 40 percent, and total sand content is 45 to 65 percent.  Sand is mainly fine or coarser sand."

Barkelew soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a cambic horizon.  Brownsto soils in most years receive a greater proportion of total precipitation when the soil temperature is less than 41 degrees F.  Bruja soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

Strata are of variable thickness and texture, and include weakly cemented conglomerate with fragments of volcanic rocks.  Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 8,400 feet.   The mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 16 inches."

Pinyon and juniper have been chained off many areas to improve grass production.  Principal vegetation in unchained areas is an open-to-moderately dense stand of pinyon and Rocky Mountain juniper and an understory of blue grama, western wheatgrass, mountain muhly, little bluestem, mountain mahogany, and other forbs and shrubs."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision updates the classification from a Borollic Calciorthids to be compatible to the 1994 Amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil include an ochric epipedon from 0 to 6 inches; and a calcic horizon from 6 to 60 inches; over 35 percent rock fragments in the texture control section.  It has an ustic aridic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.  Last updated by the state 8/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
