    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the very gravelly material and to the top of the calcic horizon ranges from 12 to 20 inches. The control section ranges from very gravelly fine sandy loam to very gravelly light sandy clay loam and very gravelly loam. Carbonate content ranges from 40 to about 65 percent in the control section. Soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F. The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. The C1ca horizon ranges from pinkish gray to white. It has weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure or is massive. The C2ca horizon has about the same color range as the C1ca horizon but contains only a few scattered rock fragments and is massive."

Andrews soils have average soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F. and have limestone bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Arch and Karro soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments and less than 40 percent carbonates in the control section. Aztec, Nickel, and Stagecoach soils contain less than 40 percent carbonates in the control section. Aztec, Nickel, and Stagecoach soils contain less than 40 percent carbonates in the control section. Dean and Willard soils have soil temperatures between 47 degrees and 59 degrees F., have less than 35 percent rock fragments and less than 40 percent carbonates in the control section. Ildefonso soils have average annual soil temperatures between 47 degrees to 59 degrees F. and contain less than 40 percent carbonates in the control section. Jal and Laveldo soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and have aridic moisture regimes. Polar soils have mixed mineralogy and the Potter soils are shallow. Mansker soils have mollic epipedons and contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Sanpete soils have mean annual soil temperatures between 47 degrees and 59 degrees F.  at a depth of 20 inches. Weiser soils have aridic moisture regimes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Bascom soils are on undulating to gently rolling uplands with slopes ranging from 1 to 9 percent. The soils formed in moderately coarse to medium textured mixed sediments with high carbonate content.  The parent material shows influence of reworked Jurassic and Triassic redbed material. The general landscape is rounded ridge crests and valley bottom; very few sharp features occur. The climate is semiarid continental. Near the type location, the average annual temperature is 58 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches of which more than 1/2 occurs in the summer months during heavy thunderstorms."

Ima and La Lande soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments and lack calcic horizons. The Montoya soils have fine textured control sections, crack when dry, and contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Redona soils are nonskeletal and have argillic horizons."
