  "OVERVIEW": "The Badgermont series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium mixed with loess over basalt.  These soils are in drainageways on piedmont slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 26 inches thick and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 25 to 55 percent.  The lower Bt averages 50 to 70 percent pebbles and cobbles.  Depth to basalt is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is 15 to 25 percent pebbles and cobbles by volume.  Base saturation is 60 to 75 percent.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is a cobbly loam or very cobbly loam. Base saturation is 65 to 85 percent with some part having base saturation of less than 75 percent.\nThe Bt3 and Bt4 horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam.  Base saturation is 75 to 90 percent."
