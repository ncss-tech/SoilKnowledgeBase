  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually dry between 8 to 24 inches for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to secondary lime is 15 to 25 inches.  The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 dry and 3 moist with chroma of 2 and 3 moist and dry.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist with chroma of 3 and 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Its structure is moderate fine or medium prismatic or weak or moderate subangular blocky.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 to 8 dry and 3 to 5 moist with chroma of 2 and 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Its structure is weak fine or medium subangular blocky or weak fine to coarse prismatic.\nThe 2C horizon is stratified loam to very fine sandy loam.  It is massive or platy.\nThe surface in some areas has basalt stones and cobbles from eroding cap rock."

The Bamos soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  The Bidwell soils have a moderately slow permeability, have 12 to 18 inches of precipitation and are dry for 120 to 150 days.  The Doyce soils have a calcic horizon.  Estive soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick and a mean soil temperature of 47 to 49 degrees F.  Haw soils lack free carbonates in the solum.  Lucero soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brogan soils occur on 10 to 65 percent slopes on northerly-facing terrace faces and uplands at elevations of 2,400 to 4,000 feet.  The soils are formed from loess over mixed lacustrine sediments.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with hot dry summers and cold winters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 48 to 50 degrees F, the mean summer air temperature is 69 degrees F, and the mean winter air temperature is 21 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 110 to 140 days."

Poall soils are formed from similar material but occur on south-facing slopes, lack mollic epipedons and are fine textured.  Locey soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock, lack mollic epipedons and are fine textured."
