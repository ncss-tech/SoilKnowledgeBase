  "OVERVIEW": "The Bulake series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt and rhyolite with surficial mantles of loess and volcanic ash.  Bulake soils are on plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Glass contents in laboratory data indicate enough for ashy texture modifiers.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Bulake has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID 80NV007806 (pedon # 81P0244).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
