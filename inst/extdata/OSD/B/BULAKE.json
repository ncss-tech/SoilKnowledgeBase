Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Elevations range from 1,585 to 1,740 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to l00 days."

Glass contents in laboratory data indicate enough for ashy texture modifiers.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Bulake has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID 80NV007806 (pedon # 81P0244).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
