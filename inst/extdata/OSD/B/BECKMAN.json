  "OVERVIEW": "The Beckman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in recent calcareous and saline clayey alluvium over Permian age shales and claystones.  These soils are on nearly level flood plains of minor drains of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA-78B, 78C).  Slope is 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",
