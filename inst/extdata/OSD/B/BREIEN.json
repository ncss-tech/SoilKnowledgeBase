  "OVERVIEW": "The Breien series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid over rapidly permeable soils that formed in recently deposited sandy and loamy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and low terraces and have slope ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates is more than 10 inches.  The depth to sand or loamy fine sand is 14 to 20 inches.  Some pedons contain one or more layers of very fine sand, loam, or finer materials.  Some pedons have thin layers of gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Values of 5 or less dry and 3 or less moist usually are in the upper part.  The C horizon is fine sandy loam, fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  Where fine sandy loam is present it is in the upper 4 to 15 inches only.  The C horizon may also have strata of loam, very fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Banks soils do not have a dark colored surface layer more than 6 inches thick and have carbonates at depths of less than 10 inches. Havrelon and Trembles soils are fine-loamy and coarse-loamy respectively.  Straw soils are fine-loamy.  Velva soils are coarse-loamy."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: irregular decrease in organic-carbon with depth - stratifications throughout C horizon (see remark below); mollic subgroup criteria - Ap horizon with values of 3 moist and 4 dry.\nPedon S80ND037-83, the typical pedon, has an average of 48 percent fine and coarser sand in the 15 inches of loamy material.  The 15 to 40 inch section has 72.1 percent fine sand and coarser and 75.2 percent in the 15 to 60 inch section.  The typical pedon does not show an irregular decrease in organic-carbon as sampled, however, it is stratified and OC would be expected to vary if sampled in smaller increments.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
