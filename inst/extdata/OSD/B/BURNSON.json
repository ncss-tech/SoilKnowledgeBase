  "OVERVIEW": "The Burnson series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey slope alluvium over residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and shale but with some influence from eolian material.  Burnson soils are on mesas, structural benches, and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
