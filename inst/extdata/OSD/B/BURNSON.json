(A and AB horizons)  The soil is dark enough but not thick enough for a mollic epipedon.\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 29 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nLithic contact:  Sandstone bedrock at 44 inches.  (R layer)\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 8 to 28 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nSoil Taxonomy: Series clasified according to Second Edition, 1999\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Hydrometer analysis of Bt horizons done at the field lab.  A nearby site sampled by NSSL, sample number S86-CO-033-001, sampled as Burnac but further study by the field party determined the need for the hydrometer analysis and a new series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
