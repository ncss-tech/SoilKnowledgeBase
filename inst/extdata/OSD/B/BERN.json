  "OVERVIEW": "The Bern series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and mixed alluvium. They are on stream terraces. Permeability is moderately slow. Bern soils have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
