Slopes are 5 to 25 percent. Elevations range from 1,480 to 1,710 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to  9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
