  "OVERVIEW": "The Brabble series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Brabble soils are on hills. Slopes are 5 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
