    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact commonly is between 40 and 60 inches, but can be deeper when there is a decrease of clay in the lower profile. The particle size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay content, and has hue of 5YR in at least some part of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Eroded areas are redder. The A horizon, where present, has hue if 10YR, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2 to 4 and is less than 6 inches in thickness.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 0 to 7 percent gravel.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 or 4, and is 2 to 4 inches in thickness. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 0 to 7 percent gravel. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt (where present) and the upper part of the 2Bt horizon have hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel. Reaction is slightly alkaline to very strongly acid.\nThe lower part of the 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, with some part more red than 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay, clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues. It contains from 0 to 50 percent angular chert gravel fragments that are 2 mm. to 76 mm. in size and 0 to 10 percent angular cherty gravel fragments that are larger than 76 mm. in size. Reaction is neutral to very strongly acid."

Beasley, Bledsoe, Bonnell, Brashear, Jessup, Lowell, and Newnata soils have Bt horizons no redder than 7.5YR in any part. Bland, Bratton, Caneyville, Chrome, Donahue, Eden, Faywood, Fredonia, Heverlo, Milton, Shrouts, Solway, Woodsfield and Wynn soils have either lithic or paralithic contacts within depths of 40 inches. Briggsville, Cosperville, Elba, Eldean, Kewaunee, Mountpleasant, and Muncie soils have free calcium carbonate in the lower part of the control section, usually within a depth of 40 inches.  Estate soils contain more than 15 percent sand in the upper one-fourth of the control section.  Heitt soils average less than 54 degrees F. in the soil temperature control section; are more moist in the soil moisture control section in July and August and have lower Thornthwaite P-E indices. Haggatt soils average from 45 to 60 percent clay in the particle size control section. Vandalia soils contain coarse fragments of shale, siltstone or sandstone throughout the control section.  Markland soils contain some thin subhorizons that average more than 75 percent silt and some that contain more than 75 percent clay in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These gently sloping to very steep soils are on upland side slopes and secondary summits.  Slope gradients are dominantly 5 to 20 percent, but range from 2 to 35 percent. These soils formed in loess and the underlying clayey materials or residuum from dolomite or limestone, and thinly interbedded shale. Average annual air temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F., and average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

Bardley and Gasconade soils are more shallow than 40 inches to bedrock.  Menfro and Winfield soils formed in deep loess and do not have hue as red as 5YR in any part.  Union soils have fragipans."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Bucklick soils were formerly mapped as Hagerstown soils in Missouri. Yield data for the Bucklick series is approximately half of what is obtained on the Hagerstown soils.  The forest ordination for Hagerstown series is 1, and for the Bucklick series, it is 3.  The principal reason for the difference is climate.  Missouri is midcontinental; hot summers and cold winters.  Hagerstown is temperate.  The annual temperature and precipitation is similar for both series, but the pattern of distribution is different.  Missouri has less rainfall and warmer temperatures in July and August.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to about 6 inches (Ap horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 6 inches to 50 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons); lithic contact - 50 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
