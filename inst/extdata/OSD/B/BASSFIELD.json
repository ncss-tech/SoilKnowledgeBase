Some pedons\ncontain as much as 10 percent by volume of quartz or chert gravel\nin the B horizon and as much as 20 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except in areas where the surface layer has been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, with either value of 4, and chroma\nof 1 to 3, or value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3, or it is mottled\nin shades of brown.  It is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and\nchroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy loam or loam.  The upper 20 inches\nof the Bt horizon has 8 to 18 percent clay, and it has 20 to 45 percent silt.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, value of 6, and chroma of 6, or\nit has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 6 to\n8, or it has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 to 6,\nor it is mottled in shades of brown, red, and white.  It is loamy sand or sand."

Latonia soils have a Bt horizon\nwith hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y.  Rumford soils have less than 20\npercent silt in the Bt horizon.  Cahaba and Maxton soils have 18\nto 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.\nLucy soils have an arenic epipedon.  McLaurin soils have a solum\nmore than 60 inches thick.  Ruston and Smithdale soils have a\nthicker solum and have a Bt horizon with 18 to 35 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in fluvatile or marine sediments that are loamy in the upper part\nand sandy in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 60 inches."

Well drained Cahaba soils are in\nsimilar positions as Bassfield soils.  Well drained Ruston and Smithdale soils are in higher positions on hillsides and ridges.  Somewhat poorly drained Kirkville soils and well drained Jena\nsoils, which are in lower positions on flood plains, do not have\na Bt horizon.  Moderately well drained Ora soils, which are in\nhigher positions on terraces and uplands, have a fragipan."
