    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 60 to 80 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 17 and 44 inches is moist in all parts from December 15 through March 30 and is dry in all parts from June 1 through October 15.  Most pedons have a surface pavement of 75 to 95 percent angular obsidian fragments 2 to 50 mm in diameter.  Coarse and very coarse obsidian sands ranges from 15 to 30 percent throughout.  The soil is dominated by amorphous materials.  Clay mineralogy is dominantly hallosite and gibbsite.  It is weakly or moderately smeary throughout.  Bulk density varies from 1 to 1.5 and typically increases with depth.  The pH ranges from 8 to 9.5 and increases with depth.  Base saturation varies from 50 to 75 percent throughout and typically decreases with depth.\nThe upper 1 to 2 inches of the A horizon is 90 to 95 percent obsidian gravel 2 to 50 mm in diameter occurring as a surface pavement.\nThe A2 horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  It is extremely gravelly with 70 to 85 percent gravel 2 to 50 mm in diameter.\nThe A3 horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3 or 5/4.  Rounded shot (2 to 10 mm) content is 40 to 60 percent.  It has 5 to 15 percent angular obsidian fragments from 2 to 50 mm in diameter.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/8, 6/2, 6/4, 7/6, 7/7; 2.5YR 3/6 or 10YR 7/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/3, 4/6, 5/6; 10YR 5/2 or 5/4.  Chromas of greater than 4 occur in some parts of the lower Bt horizon.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly clay.  In the lower part of the argillic horizon the texture is always very gravelly clay.  The particle size control section has 25 to 35 percent clay.  Rounded shot content varies from 1 to 10 mm and is 35 to 60 percent.  It has 5 to 15 percent angular obsidian fragments.  It is strongly or moderately acid."
