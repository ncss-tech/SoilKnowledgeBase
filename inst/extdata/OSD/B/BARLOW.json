  "OVERVIEW": "The Barlow series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess or eolian deposits overlying glacial till. Barlow soils are on ridges and steep smooth slopes in high mountainous areas and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
