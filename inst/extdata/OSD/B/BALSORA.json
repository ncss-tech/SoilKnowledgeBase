    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam that his distinctly or prominently stratified with one or more of these textures and thin lenses of very fine sandy loam or silty clay.  The weighted average clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Less than 15 percent of the soil is coarser than very fine sand.  The soil ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Interbedded strata of noncalcareous and calcareous materials are common.  Typically, the surface layer is noncalcareous.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mollic colored horizons are less than 10 inches thick.  Commonly the texture is silt loam or loam and less commonly silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have thin strata of very dark grayish brown or dark brown, and some pedons have a few brownish mottles.  Texture is dominantly silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam stratified with thin lenses of very fine sandy loam or silty clay.\nBuried horizons, when encountered, are typically below a depth of 40 inches and are dark gray, grayish brown, or dark grayish brown silty clay loam or silty clay."

Soils in similar families are Bergstrom, Bigetty, Bunyan, Colorado, Elandco, Energy, Iraan, Port, Pulaski, Pulexas, and Yomont.  Bergstron, Bigetty, Elandco, Iraan and Port soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Buyan, Colorado, and Energy soils have a fine-loamy control section and in addition Colorado and Energy soils are calcareous.  Pulaski and Pulexas soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Yomont soils have a coarse-silty control section and are calcareous."
