  "OVERVIEW": "The Bunky series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  The Bunky soils are on fans piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
