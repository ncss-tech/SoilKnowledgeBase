  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Stratification is present throughout the soil profile with rock fragment percentages, on average, ranging from 0 to 30 percent in the A horizon and the B horizon above 20 inches. Rock fragments, on average, range from 15 to 50 percent from 20 to 40 inches and 10 to 60 percent below 40 inches. Some individual subhorizons may have greater or lesser amounts.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 (more than 6 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 5 inches thick that has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon, where present, is up to 8 inches thick, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. The Ap, A, and E horizons are loam, sandy loam, and silt loam or their gravelly analogues. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have BE or BA horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 to 6. Textures are commonly sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly and very gravelly analogues, and less commonly silt loam or silty clay loam to a maximum depth of 24 inches, except as thin subhorizons in some pedons. The control section averages from 18 to 30 percent clay. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 to 6. Textures are sandy loam, loamy sand, sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, or their gravelly and very gravelly analogues. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures are commonly gravelly or very gravelly analogues of loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, and less commonly sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand with thin strata of gravel in some pedons. Stratification of other textures is present in some pedons. The C horizon commonly is strongly acid to slightly acid, and less commonly neutral or slightly alkaline. The lower part contains free carbonates in some pedons."

Centerburg, Cygnet, Jenera, Jugtown, Nicely, Swampoodle, Tuscola, and Vanlue soils have less rock fragments in the series control section. Haney and Thackery soils are more alkaline in the series control section. Houcktown and Williamstown soils have a densic contact within the series control section. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches. Scattersville soils have a higher mean annual temperature."

The moderately well drained Canfield, Ellsworth, and Rittman and somewhat poorly drained Wadsworth are adjacent soils on till plains. The well drained Chagrin and moderately well drained Lobdell soils are on flood plains. The well drained Chili on higher landscape positions, somewhat poorly drained Jimtown soils on lower landscape positions, and poorly drained Damascus and very poorly drained Olmstead soils on lower landscape positions and in depressions are in toposequence with Bogart soils. The somewhat poorly drained Fitchville and moderately well drained Glenford soils are on adjacent deposits of silty lacustrine sediments."
