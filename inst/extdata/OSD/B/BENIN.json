  "OVERVIEW": "The Benin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and loess high in volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits.  Benin soils are on lake terraces, dissected lake plains and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
