  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Benin soils are on smooth, nearly level or slightly concave dissected lake terraces, lake plains, and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and loess high in volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,130 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 230 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
