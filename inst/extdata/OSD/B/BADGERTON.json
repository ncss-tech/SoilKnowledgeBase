  "OVERVIEW": "The Badgerton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils form on stream terraces and flood plains on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
