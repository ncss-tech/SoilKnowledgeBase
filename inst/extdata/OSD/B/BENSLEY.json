The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and l2 inches during the summer.  The depth to bedrock commonly is more than 60 inches but it is as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section are 35 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam, very cobbly clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam, and averages 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has moderate or weak subangular blocky structure and peds are hard or very hard.  It has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments."

Endlich, Herterwa, Valsetz and Klootch soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Grenadier soils have an E horizon, have B horizons less than 20 inches thick and lack distinct dry period.  Leighcan soils have an E horizon and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Marsell soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the B horizon, have an E horizon and dominantly are coarse-textured. Oatman soils are slightly acid or medium acid, have a distinct dry period of slightly more than 45 days during the summer, and are friable throughout.  Jeru soils have less than 18 percent clay throughout the profile."
