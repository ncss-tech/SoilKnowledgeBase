    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This soil is dry in the soil moisture control section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Vertical cracks ranging in width of 5 to 37 mm extend from the surface to a depth of about 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle size control section is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  Depth to secondary carbonate accumulation is 15 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay.\nThe Bn horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  SAR is 20 to 50.\nThe Bk horizons have hues of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Carbonates appear as soft masses or as mycelium threads.  SAR is 20 to 40."

These soils formed in fine textured sediment weathered from the John Day Formation.  Elevation is 1,800 to 2,200 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
