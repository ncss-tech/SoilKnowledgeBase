  "OVERVIEW": "The Beeman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine textured, interbedded sediments weathered from the John Day Formation.  Beeman soils are on incised flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
