    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section more than half of the time when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 40 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments by volume. Solum thickness and depth to duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 2 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has 5 to 10 percent pebbles.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Btk and 2Bk horizons have value 5 or 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist.  They are very cobbly loam, very gravelly loam or very cobbly clay loam.  The 2Btk horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 3Bkqm horizon is indurated, has gravelly to extremely gravelly matrix, 8 to 36 inches thick with 1 to 5 inches thick silica plates and is above weakly cemented to indurated alluvium.\nThe 4Bkqm/C horizon is made up of weakly cemented to indurated layers of varying thickness, separated by continuous and discontinuous layers of alluvium."
