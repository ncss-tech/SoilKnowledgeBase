  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bitner soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff-breccia and similar pyroclastic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,630 to 2,100 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
