  "OVERVIEW": "The Bitner series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff-breccia and similar pyroclastic rocks.  Bitner soils are on plateaus. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
