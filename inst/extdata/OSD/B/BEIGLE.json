Domell and Tolany soils are very deep and have a solum more than 60 inches thick.  Giveout soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Hyas soils have 15 to 40 percent soft rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Jonas soils have silty clay loam and clay loam textures in the particle-size control section. Lates soils have a lithic contact with basalt at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Marty soils have a Bw horizon with hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Moe soils have an apparent clay content of 35 to 45 percent in the B horizon and lack hard rock in the particle-size control section.  Murnen soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Murtip soils are 40 to more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact.  Vailton soils have 15 to 40 percent soft siltstone and sandstone fragments in the particle-size control section. Wilhoit soils have an umbric epipedon more than 20 inches thick.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beigle soils are in upland basins, on benches, mountainsides, and broad ridgetops at elevations of 1,800 to 2,800 feet.   Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from highly weathered andesite and andesitic volcanic breccia with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. The climate is marine and characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 140 to 190 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED/SOILS:  These are the competing Jonas and Xeno soils, and the Pheeney, Sarazan, Voight, and Zynbar soils. Pheeney soils are medial-skeletal and have a lithic contact with andesite at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Sarazan soils are medial-skeletal.  Voight soils have an argillic horizon.  Zynbar soils have a bulk density of less than 0.85g/cc in the upper part of the particle-size control section."
