  "OVERVIEW": "The Broadus series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on hills and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 8 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
