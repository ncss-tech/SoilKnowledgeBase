  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is below 47 degrees F. from about January 15 to late February.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually dry all of the time from about May 15 until about January 1 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments are less than 1 percent.  Textures throughout are clay or silty clay.  Cracks 2 to 10 cm. wide extend from the surface to a depth of 20 inches or more or extend down to the paralithic contact.  Cracks usually remain closed from about January until April or May and are open all the rest of the time.  Slickensides are small and few to common, but intersecting slickensides are lacking.  The soils are effervescent throughout. Gypsum makes up about 6 to 25 percent of the soil, but the amount of gypsum in any pedon increases several percent from the surface to a depth of 4 to 12 inches and remains nearly constant in the remainder of the soil profile.  Other salts more soluble than gypsum have EC at 25 degrees C.  of 3 to 25 millimhos/cm.  The EC increases from the surface to a depth of about 4 to 12 inches and remains nearly constant in the rest of the soil profile.  The A horizon is light brownish gray to light yellowish brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4).  It has medium to strong granular and weak to strong platy structure.  The B2 horizon is pale brown to brown (10YR 6/3, 5/3, 6/4).  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure.  In some pedons the lower part of the B2 horizon has weak or moderate angular blocky structure.  The C horizon of soil material is brown to olive (10YR 7/2, 7/3, 6/3, 6/4, 5/3, 5/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 4/2; 5Y 5/2, 5/3, 5/4).  Colors are related to color of the parent material."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ayar, Karlo, Kettleman, Nacimiento, and Shedd series.  Ayar and Nacimiento soils have mollic epipedons and are moist for about 180 days when the temperature is above 47 degrees F.  Karlo soils have a lithic contact at depths of 24 to 40 inches and have a frigid temperature regime.  Kettleman and Shedd soils have less than 35 percent clay and lack deep wide soil cracks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ballinger soils are strongly sloping to very steep and are on rounded hills at elevations of 1,800 to 3,000 feet.  They formed in residuum weathered from soft shale and mudstone containing considerable gypsum and other salts.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches and snow is quickly melted.  Average January temperature is about 43 degrees F., average July temperature is about 75 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 180 to 250 days."
