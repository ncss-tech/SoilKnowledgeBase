This change was made to be consistent with the Vertic features described and the moisture regime.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil was the subject of a soil nutrient study and was intensively sampled.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
