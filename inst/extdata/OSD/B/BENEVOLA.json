  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no known soils in the same family. Soils in closely related families are the Atwell, Brooke, Bradyville, Caleast, Chilhowie, Clanton, Dandria, Fleming, Fulshear, Jericho, Markham McAfee and Salvisa series are similar soils in related families. The Atwell soils have vermiculitic mineralogy; Brooke, Caleast, Chilhowie, Fleming, McAfee and Salvisa soils have mixed mineralogy; Bradyville and Fulshear have mixed mineralogy and mean annual temperatures greater than 59 degrees F., and Dandria soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy. Clanton soils lack sandy substrata and has a silt mantle 8 to 15 inches thick. Jericho soils lack hues of 5YR or redder in the solum. Markham soils center on hues of 10YR and have mottling in the lower part of the IIB horizon."

Hagerstown soils formed in residuum weather from limestone.  Conestoga, Hyattstown, Letort, and Linganore soils are formed in residuum form micaceous calcareous schist and phyllite.  Conestoga and Letort are very deep and average less than 35 percent clay throughout.  Hyattstown and Linganore soils have bedrock less than 40.  Glenelg, Glenville, and Manor soils formed in residuum weathered from micaeous phyllite and schist, average less than 35 percent clay and occupy higher landscape positions.  Funkstown formed from local alluvium over limestone residuum, are moderately well drained and average less than 35 percent clay throughout.  Wiltshire soils formed from local alluvium and colluvium from phyllite and schist, have a fragipan and are moderately well drained."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Benevola was previously mapped in the sedimentary region of MLRA 147.  The concept was changed to cover areas of marble in MLRA 148.  This soil was previously mapped as Elioak in Frederick and Howard Counties Maryland.  Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\na) Mollic  epipedon - The zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon). This soil series meets all the requirements for a mollic epipedon except thickness.\nb) Argillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 57 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data can be referenced as S98MD021-132 from the National Cooperative Soil Survey.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
