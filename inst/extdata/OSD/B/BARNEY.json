  "OVERVIEW": "The Barney series consists of very deep poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy material deposited over sandy and gravelly alluvium on flood plains along major streams. Permeability is rapid or very rapid below the loamy material. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Many areas of soils in the Barney series have been called \"Wet alluvial land\" or \"Riverwash, stabilized\" in former surveys.\nOSD Modification RRZ 2/2002: Changed the ROC of gravels from 20 to 40 to 10 to 40 inches.\nDiagnostic features recognized in this pedon: mollic colors--the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon); aquic soil conditions--the zone from 7 to 60 inches (Cg1 and Cg2 horizons). The high chromas or brownish colors in the Cg horizons of these soils are due to the colors of the mineral sand grains rather than indicators of reduction and oxidation.\n1/2004 WAW: Added mucky loam and clay loam to texture range of A, and strata of mucky loam, clay loam, and mucky peat to the Cg horizons as suggested by Roger Hammer from work on the \"Interduanl soils mapped on flood plains\" project."
