    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the A horizon where present, and in the B horizon.  It ranges from 5 to 30 percent in the substratum. Rock fragments are pebbles, cobbles, channers, and stones.  Stones cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe Oa horizon, and the Oe horizon where present, have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 and chroma of 1 or 2.  They have weak or moderate fine granular structure.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 1.  It is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction and has granular structure.  Consistence is friable when moist and slightly sticky when wet.\nThe Bw horizon where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.  Consistence is friable when moist and non-sticky to sticky when wet.\nTh Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has granular, subangular blocky, or platy structure.  Consistence is friable when moist and nonsticky or slightly sticky when wet.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It is massive and consistence is firm or very firm."

Sisk and Enchanted soils are well drained and are on steeper slopes.  Surplus soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils in more convex or more sloping areas.  Ricker soils are organic and are very shallow to moderately deep to bedrock."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 13 inches (Bg horizon).\nc.  Cd horizon - a very firm, dense basal till at a depth of 13 inches.  d.  Aeric feature - chroma of 3 in the Cd1 horizon above 20 inches.  e.  Cryic feature - studies done in Franklin County, Maine show that these wet, high elevation soils are saturated with water during some part of the summer and that the average summer temperature is lower than 43 degrees F.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The soil interpretation record number for the Bemis series, stony is ME0139.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
