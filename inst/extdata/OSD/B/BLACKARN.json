    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSolum thickness ranges from 40 to 72 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 90 percent by volume. Average rock fragment content in the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 90 percent by volume. They range from gravel to boulders in size. Typically, the amount of rock fragments increases with depth. Rock fragment content is typically more than 50 percent in the C horizon.\nRange of Individual Horizons:\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nA thin AB horizon occurs in some pedons. It has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizion has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."
