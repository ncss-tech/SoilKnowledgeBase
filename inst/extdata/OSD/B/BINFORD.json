  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the underlying sand and gravel ranges from about 14 to 25 inches.  Typically the solum is sandy loam, but includes loam or coarse sandy loam.  It averages between 6 and 18 percent clay, 8 and 35 percent silt, and has as much as 8 percent gravel.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness, but ranges to 19 inches when underlain with sandy materials within 20 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 13 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1. It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Chroma of 4 is allowed in the lower part.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam.  It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have clay films.  Some pedons have 2Bw or 2Bk horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sand, coarse sand, very coarse sand or loamy coarse sand, or thier gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues. The gravel content of indiviual subhorizons ranges from 5 to as much as 70 percent, with the horizon averaging less than 35 percent gravel.  The 0.1 to 76 mm fraction in the 2C horizon averages more than 20 percent shale. Crossbedding and stratification is common in the 2C horizon.  The 2C horizon is moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Binford soils are on level to strongly sloping outwash plains, deltas, eskers, kames, terraces and beach ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits consisting of moderately coarse-textured material that is underlain by sand and gravel that has appreciable amounts of shale.  Mean annual air temperature is about 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 15 to 23 inches."

They are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Coe soils are on nearby steeper ridges and hills.  They are sandy-skeletal.  Divide and Wyrene soils are on nearby lower-lying areas.  They have an aquic moisture regime.  Walum soils are in concave areas and shallow swales.  They are moderately well drained."
