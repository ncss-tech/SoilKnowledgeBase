  "STATES": "AR,KY,MS,MO,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beulah series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium. These level to gently sloping soils are on floodplains and low terraces in natural levees positions bordering former channels of the Mississippi River, MLRA 131. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.",
