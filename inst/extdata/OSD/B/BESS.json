  "OVERVIEW": "The Bess series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Bess soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
