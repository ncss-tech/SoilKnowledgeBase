  "OVERVIEW": "The Brazon series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone and calcareous shales. These soils are on uplands and mountain foot slopes and fans. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 510 mm, and mean annual temperature is 5.5 degrees C.",
