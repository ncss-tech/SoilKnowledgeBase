  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigpiney series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 205 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
