  "OVERVIEW": "The Bakopi series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt.  Bakopi soils are on escarpments or lava flows.  Slopes range from 30 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13.3 degrees C (56 degrees F).",
