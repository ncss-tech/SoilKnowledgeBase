  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownscombe series consists of moderately deep, well\ndrained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from\ndiorite with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.\nThese soils are on hills and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.\nThe mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the\nmean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry in all parts\nbetween depths of 4 to 12 inches for at least half the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature is above\n41 degrees F and are continuously dry between depths of 4\nand 12 inches for more than three months following the\nsummer solstice.  The depth to weathered bedrock is 20 to 40\ninches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52\ndegrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to\n45 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches\nthick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent\ngravel.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5\ndry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is\nclay loam, sandy clay loam or sandy clay with 0 to 10\npercent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Carbonates are\npresent in some pedons but where present they are below 30\ninches.  It has 30 to 45 percent clay and contains over 15\npercent coarse and very coarse sand.  It is neutral to\nmoderately alkaline."

The Cagle series\nhas 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size\ncontrol section and 15 to 50 percent or more rock fragments\nin the A horizon.  Cagle soils have weathered from andesite\nand probably contain less than 15 percent coarse and very\ncoarse sand in the Bt horizon.  Correco, Northmore and\nSimpson soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Perla\nsoils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Sherar\nsoils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments dominantly\ncobbles throughout the solum.  Sherar soils have developed\nfrom clayey sediments and have less than 15 percent coarse\nand very coarse sand.  Wicup soils have carbonates within 30\ninches and have textures of the Bt horizons with less than\n15 percent coarse or very coarse sand."
