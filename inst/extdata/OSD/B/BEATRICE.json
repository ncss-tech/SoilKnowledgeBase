  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid except surface layers that have been limed.  The calcium magnesium ratio is less than 1.  The COLE is more than 0.09 in the Bt horizon.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon, where present, is as much as 4 inches thick and has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture of the A and E horizons is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have a few mottles in shades of red or brown.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 with common to many mottles in shades of gray, red, yellow, or brown; or it is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are within the upper 10 to 24 inches of the Bt horizon.  The clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 60 to 80 percent.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 with mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown; or it is mottled in shades of gray, red, yellow, and brown.  It is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has the same colors as the BC or CB horizon and it is weathered clayey shale; stratified with sandy clay loam and clay loam in some pedons.  The clayey shale layers range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness and the loamy material is a few millimeters thick.  At depths of more than 60 inches, the clayey shale is continuous."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Arundel soils are underlain by horizontally bedded sandstone, shale, or siltstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sacul soils have COLE values of less than 0.09."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beatrice soils are on smooth convex very gently sloping to sloping uplands of the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in clayey shaly marine sediments.  The climate is warm and humid with average annual temperature of 65 degrees F. and average annual precipitation of 54 inches near the type location."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Arundel and Sacul soils, these are the Iuka, Luverne, and Mantachie soils.  Arundel and Sacul soils are on similar landforms.  Iuka soils are on adjacent flood plains, have a coarse-loamy control section, and do not have an argillic horizon.  Luverne soils are on adjacent side slopes, have a control section with less than 60 percent clay, and have a moderate shrink-swell potential.  Mantachie soils are on adjacent flood plains, are somewhat poorly drained, have a fine-loamy control section, and do not have an argillic horizon."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Beatrice series was formerly included in the Boswell and Sacul series.  The low chroma mottles in the argillic horizon are interpreted as being inherited from the parent material and do not indicate wetness.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 3 to 41 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size, chemical, and mineralogy data are available for the typical pedon (S79AL-99-13-(1-6).  Alabama Highway Department test data are also available on the typical pedon.  Partial data are available on one other pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
