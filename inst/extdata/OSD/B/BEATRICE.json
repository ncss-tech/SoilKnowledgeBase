    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid except surface layers that have been limed.  The calcium magnesium ratio is less than 1.  The COLE is more than 0.09 in the Bt horizon.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon, where present, is as much as 4 inches thick and has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture of the A and E horizons is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have a few mottles in shades of red or brown.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 with common to many mottles in shades of gray, red, yellow, or brown; or it is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are within the upper 10 to 24 inches of the Bt horizon.  The clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 60 to 80 percent.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 with mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown; or it is mottled in shades of gray, red, yellow, and brown.  It is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has the same colors as the BC or CB horizon and it is weathered clayey shale; stratified with sandy clay loam and clay loam in some pedons.  The clayey shale layers range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness and the loamy material is a few millimeters thick.  At depths of more than 60 inches, the clayey shale is continuous."

Arundel and Sacul soils are on similar landforms.  Iuka soils are on adjacent flood plains, have a coarse-loamy control section, and do not have an argillic horizon.  Luverne soils are on adjacent side slopes, have a control section with less than 60 percent clay, and have a moderate shrink-swell potential.  Mantachie soils are on adjacent flood plains, are somewhat poorly drained, have a fine-loamy control section, and do not have an argillic horizon."
