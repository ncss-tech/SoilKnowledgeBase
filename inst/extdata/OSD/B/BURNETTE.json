  "STATES": "CO,MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Burnette series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alpine till, alluvium, colluvium and slide deposits derived from shale and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, moraines, till plains, mountain slopes and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
