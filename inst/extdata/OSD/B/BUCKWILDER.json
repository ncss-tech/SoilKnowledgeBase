    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are moist in the winter and spring and dry in the summer and fall for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 56 to 59 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is 60 to 75 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments, mainly as gravel and cobbles.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches thick and includes the 2Bt horizon.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 16 to 30 inches.  The linear extensibility of the solum is 6.0 to 8.0 centimeters.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  There is an absolute clay increase of 25 to 40 percent between the A and 2Bt horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is clay with 60 to 75 percent clay.  It contains 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Btk horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is clay with 60 to 75 percent clay.  It contains 10 to 25 percent rock fragments.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,200 feet.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
