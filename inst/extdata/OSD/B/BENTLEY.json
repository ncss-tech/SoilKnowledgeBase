  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Bentley soils were formerly mapped with the Mattaponi series. The 04/97 relocation of the mesic/thermic soil temperature regime line necessitated the creation of soils that are mesic counterparts within MLRA 136.  These soils are affected by periodic episaturation (seasonally perched water table) at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet below the soil surface. Redoximorphic characteristics and associated aquic conditions are typically too deep for these soils to classify in an \"Aquic\" subgroup.  It is not uncommon for Bentley soils to include areas of a similar soil that has a pale clay curve.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 and 23 inches (Ap and BA horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 23 and 61 inches (Bt and BCt horizon)\nAquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction within 30 to 42 inches of the soil surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 80 inches of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone (episaturation)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 61 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data from 3 pedons in Halifax County Virginia is available from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Lab #98-41 (5-10); #98-41 (11-16); and #98-41 (17-20)).\nDatabase Information: Typical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--104341\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\nBENTLEY     0-25   52-57    170-205    40-55   400-1000\nSOI-5  FloodL  FloodH  Watertable  Kind     Months   Bedrock  Hardness\nNONE            2.5-3.3     PERCHED  DEC-MAR  >60         -\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture    3-Inch  No-10    Clay%  -CEC-\n0-17   SL FSL LS  0-0    85-100    5-18    4-10\n0-17   L          0-0    85-100   10-27    8-15\n0-17   CL SCL     0-0    75-100   20-40   10-20\n17-61   CL SC C    0-0    75-100   35-65   10-20\n61-80   VAR         -       -        -       -\nSOI-5  Depth   -pH-      O.M.
