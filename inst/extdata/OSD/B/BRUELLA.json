    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 47 degrees F. the entire year.  The soil moisture control section, 6 to 19 inches, is dry in all parts from June 1 to September 30, unless irrigated, and is moist in some or all parts from November 1 to May 31.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent to a depth of 60 inches or more.  Clay content of the Bt horizon does not drop 20 percent from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has color of 7.5YR 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 5/2; 10YR 6/3, 5/4, 5/3.   Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4, 3/2; 5YR 4/4,3/4; 10YR 4/4, 3/4, 3/3.  Clay content is 12 to 25 percent.  It is slightly acid to neutral, but the range includes moderately acid as a result of long term applications of sulfur for disease control.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 7.5YR 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 5/6, 4/6.   Moist color is 7.5YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 3/4; 5YR 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, 3/4.  The upper part is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  The lower part is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  Content of coarse plus very coarse sand is 10 to 20 percent.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nA Btq horizon is present below 40 inches in some pedons, it is weakly cemented soil material (but not a duripan) that will slake in water after prolonged wetting.  It has similar colors and reaction as the Bt horizon.  It is sandy clay loam, or sandy clay with 30 to 40 percent clay."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bruella soils are on low terraces and fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock sources.  Elevation is 30 to 150 feet.  Climate consists of hot dry summers and cool moist foggy winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F. and average July temperature is 77 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."
