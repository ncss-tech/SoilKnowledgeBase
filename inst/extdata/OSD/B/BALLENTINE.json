  "OVERVIEW": "The Ballentine series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent in valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 292 mm and the average annual temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",

Phyllis soils are very poorly drained (hydric) and on concave geomorphic positions. Eagle soils are on similar geomorphic positions."
