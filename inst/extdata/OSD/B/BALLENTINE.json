  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ballentine soils are on stream terraces at elevations of 748 to 869 meters. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in recent alluvium from granitic rocks with minor influence of other igneous materials. The average annual precipitation is 254 to 330 mm. The average annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C. The frost-free period is 145 to 155 days."

Eagle and Notus soils do not have mollic epipedons, and are less than 50 cm deep to sand and gravel. Moulton and Notus soils are somewhat poorly drained and on lower geomorphic positions. Phyllis soils are very poorly drained (hydric) and on concave geomorphic positions. Eagle soils are on similar geomorphic positions."

These soils are commonly saturated during the growing season due to flood irrigation."

Native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye. Recently large tracts have been urbanized and river corridors used for recreation and wildlife habitat."
