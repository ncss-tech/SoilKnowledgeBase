  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boelus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian sand deposited over loess.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is rapid in the sandy part and moderate in the silty part.  These soils are on uplands and stream terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 11 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
