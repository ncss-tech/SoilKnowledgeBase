  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 60 to 80 inches deep to a paralithic contact of weathered tuff.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from April 20 to December 25 and exceeds 47 degrees F from May 5 to November 5.  The soil is dry, in most years, between the depth of 4 and 12 inches from mid-July until mid October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Organic matter is 1.5 to 4 percent to a depth of 20 to 25 inches.  The base saturation is assumed to be 50 to 75 percent in some or all parts of the A horizon and upper part of the Bt horizon.  There are few to many stones on the surface.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray, very dark grayish brown, dark brown, dark gray, dark grayish brown or brown (10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2).  Moist colors are black, very dark brown, very dark gray, very dark grayish brown, or dark brown (10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2).  It is clay loam, stony clay loam, very stony clay loam, stony loam, or very stony loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay.   Rock fragments are 0 to 35 percent.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon has variegated colors and ranges from olive brown to reddish yellow (2.5Y 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6, 7/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6).  Moist colors range from olive brown to strong brown (2.5Y 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6).  The variegated colors are dominantly lithochromic from strongly weathered rock fragments.  It is heavy clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 60 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 2 to 15 percent in the upper part of the B2t horizon and from 0 to 5 percent in the lower part.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid.  When the soil dries, cracks from 5mm to 10mm wide are in some parts of the B2t horizon.\nThe B3 or B3t horizon has the same color and reaction range as the B2t horizon but the content of soft saprolite form the underlying tuff layers ranges from 10 to 35 percent.  There are only a very few hard rock fragments or they are lacking.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay loam and averages 27 to 40 percent clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Jacket and Bertag, Deter, Medford, Mindego, Pinehurst and Top series in other families.  Jacket soils have a large component of loess and a slightly acid to mildly alkaline B2t horizon.  Bertag and Top soils have frigid soil temperatures.  Deter, Medford and Mindego soils have greater than 75 percent base saturation throughout the upper 30 inches of the soil.  Pinehurst soils have a fine-loamy argillic horizon and bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bogus soils are on uplands at elevations of 3,500 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  They formed in material weathered from Tertiary volcanic tuff or tuff breccia.  There are a few cobbles and stones on the surface.  The climate is continental, and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 12 to 36 inches.   Mean January temperature is 27 to 33 degrees F; mean July temperature is 63 to 68 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 44 to 49 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 60 to 110 days."

Iller and Sheld soils formed in volcanic ash over weathered tuff and have frigid soil temperatures.  Jenny and Lassen soils have clay texture with wide cracks to the surface and have slickensides in the A horizon.  Kuck soils have some cracks in the A horizon that do not extend to the surface and are underlain by a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
