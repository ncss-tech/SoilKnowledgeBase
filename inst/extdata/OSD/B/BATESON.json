  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bateson series consists of very deep, well drained soils on broad plateaus.  They formed in alluvium or water-reworked eolian deposits overlying material derived from tuffaceous conglomerate.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Depth to tuffaceous, loamy-skeletal material ranges from 14 to 28 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments, mainly pebbles, are commonly less than 15 percent but range to 30 percent in some pedons.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It averages clay loam or sandy clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  Commonly, the upper part of this horizon has more than 35 percent clay.  In some pedons the lower part is loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments, mainly pebbles, are typically less than 15 percent but range to 30 percent in some pedons.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon, or 2C horizon in some pedons, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Carbonates are irregular, occurring as isolated pockets in some pedons, and are mainly authigenic.  However, some movement is evident in most pedons.  The matrix is composed largely of tuffaceous materials and is mainly coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is loamy coarse sand or loamy sand in the lower part of some pedons.  Field texturing is difficult because of the tuffaceous materials and high percentages of coarse sand and fine pebbles.  Rock fragments range form 35 to 60 percent and are mainly pebbles with 0 to 10 percent cobbles. It is commonly mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  However, some pockets of carbonate are strongly alkaline."
