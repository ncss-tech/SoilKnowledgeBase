  "OVERVIEW": "The Braf series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively or excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits, slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone.  Braf soils are on mesas and structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
