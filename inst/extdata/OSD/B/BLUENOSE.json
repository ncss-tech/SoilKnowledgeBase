    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and the depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The soil is dry between a depth of 14 to 38 inches from June to October in most years, and usually is moist in all parts from December to May.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 degrees to 54 degrees F.  In January and February the soil temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Organic matter to a depth of 10 inches is greater than 1 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2, 5/3; or 7.5YR 4/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam with 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 100 percent.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; or 7.5YR 4/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4; or 7.5YR 3/4.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam with 30 to 55 percent gravel and 10 to 15 percent cobbles.  The ratio of gravel to cobbles is greater than 2 and the total volume of rock fragments is 35 to 60 percent.  It has 15 to 27 percent clay.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent.\nThe BC horizon is similar in color and total rock fragment content to the Bt.  It is very gravelly sandy loam and very gravelly loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 60 percent.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid."

Bluesprin, Bobbitt, Gavel, Jellico, and Sallyann soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Fordice soils are formed on old alluvial terraces, have 25 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have moisture control sections that are dry for only 60 to 80 days. Hunsinger soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the control section. Keuterville soils are dry for less than 60 days and have bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Nashmead soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 54 degrees F and are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Tekoa and Vilot soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Sawtell soils have a lithologic discontinuity at depths of 15 to 25 inches.  In addition Sawtell soils are dry for only 45 to 60 consecutive days in the summer."
