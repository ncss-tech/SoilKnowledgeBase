  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beetlerock series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from granite and granodiorite rocks. The Beetlerock soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 980 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
