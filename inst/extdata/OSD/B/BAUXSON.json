  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragmental substratum ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 10 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil mantle is typically noncalcareous to the contrasting fragmental material but may be calcareous immediately above the fragmental material in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent fine channers and 0 to 5 percent angular cobble.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically clay loam or silty clay loam and more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments are typically 10 percent or less but range from 0 to 15 percent fine porcelanite channers.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 though 4.  Matrix texture is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 45 to 75 percent fine porcelanite channers and 0 to 5 percent angular cobble.\nThe 2C horizon consists of red, yellowish red, and brown fractured porcelanite.  Only a few interstices in the upper few inches are partially filled with soil material.  The porcelanite has been displaced and fractured by the heat generated when coal seams burned. Clinkers are common in some strata.  Carbonate coatings are common on coarse fragments in the upper part of this material but typically decrease with increasing depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Wilaha series in the same family and the similar Harlan and Kirtley series.  Wilaha soils formed in materials derived from pyroclastics and have substrata of cinders.  Harlan and Kirtley soils do not have fragmental substrata.  Also Kirtley soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bauxson soils are on ridge, summits, and hillslopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from weathered porcelanite.  Slopes are both complex and simple and range from 3 to 100 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches at the type location but ranges from 15 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees but ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is from 110 to 130 days depending upon aspect and elevation."

Baux soils occur intermixed with the Bauxson soils and do not have an argillic horizon.  The Shingle and Spearmont soils occur on contiguous areas over clay shale.  Both soils lack argillic horizons."
