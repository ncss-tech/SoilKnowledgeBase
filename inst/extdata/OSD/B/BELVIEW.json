    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 18 to 30 cm (7 to 12 inches) thick. Carbonates are typically at the surface or are at the surface if the upper 18 cm (7 inches) is mixed. Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 2 to 10 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam. It has 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent. Some pedons have few to many relict mottles in the Bk and C horizons. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is loam or clay loam. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 20 percent. The moderately coarse substratum phase has textures of loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It has 12 to 22 percent clay and more than 40 percent total sand. The moderately fine substratum phase has textures of loam or clay loam. It has 20 to 30 percent clay and less than 45 percent total sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Redox features are considered as relic as they do not relate to present day soil saturation. It is friable or firm based on the geomorphic surface it occurs on."

They formed in calcareous, loamy glacial till or drift of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 762 mm (25 to 30 inches). Frost free days range from 155 to 200. Elevation ranges from 213 to 479 m (700 to 1570 feet) above sea level."

The well drained Amiret, Annton (T), Clarion, Omsrud, and Ves soils are on less convex sideslopes and low rises and knolls. The somewhat poorly drained Crippin, Walnut Grove (T) and Nicollet soils are on lower lying, less sloping areas. The poorly drained Delft, Pell Creek (P), and Webster soils are on adjacent flats or drainageways. The well drained Storden and Belview soils are on the sharply convex knolls and ridges."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - zone from surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon); calcic horizon - the zone from 23 to 127 cm (9 to 50 inches) (Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons); udic moisture regime.\nCurrently, a firm clay loam till C horizon is associated with the Gary moraine in Minnesota. A friable loam till C horizon is associated with the Bemis and Altamont moraines in Minnesota. A glacial till study and distribution of similar soils by geomorphic areas in Minnesota and Iowa is needed to more accurately characterize this series by landform.\nWhere the Storden series is correlated in uncultivated areas, the Belview series may be a better fit.\nADDITIONAL DATA: For results of laboratory analysis, refer to MN. Agr. Exp. Sta. Central File Code Nos. 2103 for some data on the typical pedon and to 2104 and 2105 for data on two additional pedons. The lab data was formerly correlated as Swanlake. These pedons will now be correlated as Belview.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
