  "OVERVIEW": "The Bodry series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale.  Bodry soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
