  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 10 to 30 inches, and is not shallower than the upper 3 inches of the B2t horizon.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate ranges from 15 to 40 inches, but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons.  Thickness of sola ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches to the base of the composite argillic horizons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 inch to 10 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 70 degrees F.  Buick soils have polygenetic solums in which a younger soil is superimposed on, and merges with, a paleosol, so that either or both of the following conditions occur:  (1) have sola more than 40 inches thick to the base of the argillic horizon with subhorizon in the lower solum having darker value or grayer chroma than overlying horizon accompanied by horizons of silicate clay accumulation in which visible secondary calcium carbonate has accumulated predominantly on the surfaces of peds or in structural cracks between peds; (2) have solums more than 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon accompanied by subhorizons of silicate clay accumulation predominantly on the faces of the peds, or in the structural cracks between peds, and with the interiors of at least some peds in these subhorizons being noncalcareous.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 60 percent silt, and 10 to 50 percent sand with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand plus coarse fragments.  Buick soils usually have a large amount of very fine sand in their sand fraction.  The B2t horizon ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe B2tcab horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 75YR.  It is similar to the B2t horizon in texture.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline (crushed soil).  It grades to uniformly calcareous C horizons of loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam having subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blanding, Del Rio, Fernando, Keiser, Nepesta, Pulpit, Roubideau, Sharps, Tensleep, Verde, Wiley, and Witt series.  Blanding and Tensleep soils have hue of 5YR or redder in most of the control section.  Blanding, Del Rio, Fernando, Keiser, Tensleep, Wiley, and Witt soils lack polygenetic characteristics.  Del Rio soils have calcic horizons and have a significant component of volcanic ash and cinders.  Fernando, Keiser, Nepesta, and Wiley soils have sola less than 40 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon.  Nepesta soils have manmade Ap horizons bordering anthropic horizons in chemical character.  Roubideau soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Wiley soils are calcareous at or near the surface.  Witt soils have calcic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Buick soils are on gently to moderately sloping uplands.  The soils formed in polylithologic parent materials consisting of a deposit of eolian sediments over relatively silty alluvial materials.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches, most of which falls during the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F."
