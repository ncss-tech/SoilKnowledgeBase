  "OVERVIEW": "The Bolivar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from acid sandstone with thin beds of clayey and sandy shales.  These soils are on undulating to gently rolling uplands. Slope ranges from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
