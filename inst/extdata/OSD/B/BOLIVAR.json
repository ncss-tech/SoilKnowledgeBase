  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deanburg, Stiversville, and Toine series.  Deanburg and Toine soils have thicker sola and do not have weathered sandstone within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).  Stiversville soils formed in residuum from phosphatic sandy limestone and are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to weathered bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bolivar soils are on undulating to gently rolling upland that has somewhat broken topography.  Slope ranges from 1 to 50 percent but are typically less than 9 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from acid sandstone with thin beds of clayey and sandy shales.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 mm to 1140 mm (35 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 17 degrees C (59 to 63 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barco, Barden, Bates, Collinsville, and Hector soils.  Barco soils are in a mollic subgroup and are on similar landscapes. Barden soils are higher in the landscape and are in the fine particle size family.  Bates soils are on similar landscapes and have a mollic epipedon.  Collinsville soils are on steeper side slopes and have bedrock within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches).  Hector soils are lower in the landscape and have bedrock within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches)."
