  "OVERVIEW": "The Bidwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan remnants and fan skirts. They formed in ashy alluvium from tuffaceous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm (12 inches); mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
