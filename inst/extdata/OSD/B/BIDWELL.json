Coppersmith soils have depth ranging from 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and have Bq horizons with 20 to 70 percent durinodes. Ponyspring soils are intermittently moist in the summer for 10 to 20 days due to convection storms and have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. Simpson soils have a mollic epipedon thickness of 50 to 69 centimeters (20 to 27 inches)."

Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The climate is cool semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is about 305 to 406 mm (12 to 16 inches). Mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 9.4 degrees C (45 to 49 degrees F). The frost-free period is about 80 to 130 days."
