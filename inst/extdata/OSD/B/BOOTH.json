  "OVERVIEW": "The Booth series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived  from tuff or basalt. Booth soils are on mountains, hills or plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
