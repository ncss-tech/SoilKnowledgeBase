Iphil and Rexbrug soils have mollic epipedons and a coarse-silty particle-size control section.  Brifox soils are on terraces and hills, lower and higher on the landscape than Bearhollow soils.  Iphil soils are on similar positions as Bearhollow soils, but are on smooth to convex north and west-facing slopes.  Rexburg soils are on loess covered hills and terraces lower on the landscape than Bearhollow soils."
