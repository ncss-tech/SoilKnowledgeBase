  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  They are on hills, fan terraces and undulating basalt plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Bearhollow soils have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
