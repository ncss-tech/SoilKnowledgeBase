  "OVERVIEW": "The Brickner series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from hard sedimentary or fine grained igneous rock. These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
