  "OVERVIEW": "The Bridget series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy sediments on foot slopes, stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F at the type location.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 15 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is typically very fine sandy loam with the range including loam, and silt loam.  Reaction is typicallyneutral or slightly alkaline but is moderately alkaline in some pedons.\nThe AC horizon is transitional in color and texture between the A horizon and the upper part of the C horizon.  The texture is typically very fine sandy loam with the range including loam and silt loam.  Some pedons do not have an AC horizon.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The percent of clay in the control section averages between 5 and 18.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically very fine sandy loam with the range including loam and silt loam. Fine sandy loam is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."
