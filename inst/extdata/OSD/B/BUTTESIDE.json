  "OVERVIEW": "The Butteside series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic rocks.  Butteside soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on Cascade foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches, (686 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
