Genegraf and Ricert soils have horizons with a firm, brittle matrix.  Jerval soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 15 degrees C and visible gypsum in the series control section.  Nyserva soils are less than 38 cm to the base of the natric horizon, have very strongly alkaline reaction, and horizons with stratified strongly contrasting textures."
