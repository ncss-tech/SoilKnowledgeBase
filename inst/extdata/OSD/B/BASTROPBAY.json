  "OVERVIEW": "The Bastrop series consists of very deep, subaqueous (permanently submersed), high or very high saturated hydraulic conductivity soils that formed in sandy overwash deposits. These nearly level soils occur on sandy lagoons and bay bottoms adjacent to the barrier island. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
