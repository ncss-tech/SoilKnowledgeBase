  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to carbonates range from 16 to 35 inches.  Rock fragments, mostly pebbles and cobbles, range from 0 to 35 percent in the A horizon, 35 to 60 percent in the B horizon, and 40 to 70 percent in the C horizon.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the solum and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the 2C horizon. Some pedons have neutral, noncalcareous C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam through loamy sand. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Undisturbed areas have an A horizon up to 5 inches thick, which have properties within the range described for the Ap horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. Higher values are more common in the upper part of the B horizon. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. In some pedons thin subhorizons are sand and lack pebbles. Consistence is friable or very friable. The pH is 6.5 or more at the contact with the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 8 and chroma of 2 through 8. Texture is very gravelly or very cobbly sand, or it is stratified sand and pebbles."

Gravesend (T) and Riker (T) do not have an OSD on file to check for contrasting characteristics. Hinckley, Manchester and Otisville are moderately acid or more strongly acid in the C horizon and, in addition, Manchester soils have 5YR or redder hues throughout. Mecosta soils have a texture of the fine-earth fraction that is dominatly sand in the solum. Multorpor soils lack B horizons and have chroma of 2 or less below the A horizon. Quonset soils lack free carbonates in the C and are dominated by slate, shale and phyllite."

Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation, from 30 to 40 inches; mean annual frost-free period, from 130 to 165 days. Elevation ranges from 400 to 1500 feet above sea level."
