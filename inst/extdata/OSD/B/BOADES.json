  "OVERVIEW": "The Boades series consists of shallow to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from bedded shale and sandstone. Boades soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
