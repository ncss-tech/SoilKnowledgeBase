    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bonnydoon, Caperton, Cotharin (T) and Mipolomol series. Bonnydoon soils are somewhat excessively drained. Caperton soils have less than 18 percent clay in the solum and Cr horizons comprised of quartz diorite. Cotharin and Mipolomol soils have Cr horizons comprised of volcanic rock and are neutral throughout."

Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 10 to 1570 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, the mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F., and the frost free season is to 290 to 350 days."
