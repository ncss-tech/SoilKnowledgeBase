    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the silty mantle over clayey limestone residuum ranges from about 3 to 6 feet. Fragments chert and rounded gravel range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and Bt horizons, 0 to 20 percent in the Btx horizon, and 0 to 35 percent in the 2Bt horizon. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 34 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A and Ap horizon have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam.\nMost pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Few to common redoximorphic features are in shades of brown; some pedons have redox features in shades of gray in the lower 2 to 5 inches.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and are in shades of yellow, brown and gray, or it is an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has colors similar to the Bx horizon, except some pedons may have dominate hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  Texture is clay, silty clay, and rarely silty clay loam or their gravelly analogs."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Byler series is the only one in the family.  Series in similiar families are the Bussy, Libuse, Dulac, Loring and Providence series.  The Bussy and Libuse soils lack a clayey 2Bt horizon within the series control section and in addition the Libuse soils are over coastal plain sediments.  The Dulac, Loring and Providence soils have more than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the silt and sand fractions."

These soils formed in silty alluvium and the underlying clayey residuum of limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 58.1 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 53.1 inches."
