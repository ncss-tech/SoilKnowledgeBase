Abgese soils have more than 35 percent medium and coarse sand in the control section.  Ackley, Esha, Greenbrae, Hardtrigger (T), Harsan (T), Lankbush, Paulville, Sevy and Turria soils are greater than 40 inches to sand and gravel.  Bluelight, Colbar and Sidlake (T) soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Eusbio (T) soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Hoosegow (T), Lankbush, Morfitt and Turria soils lack carbonates above 40 inches.  Paulville and Windypoint soils have a Bk horizon.  Sevy and Zane soils have hues redder than 10YR. Shawave soils have average annual soil temperature of 53 degrees F. to 56 degrees F., and Bt horizons that are mildly or moderately alkaline."

Elevation ranges from 3,000 to 4,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost free season is 120 to 140 days."
