These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Elevation is 579 to 1700 m (1900 to 5580 ft). Mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1930 mm (39 to 76 in). The mean annual air temperature is 9 to 15 degrees C (48 to 59 degrees F).
