  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth of contrasting 2Bk or 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean annual summer temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  Rock fragment content above the 2Bk or 2C horizon ranges from 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  This horizon is typically free of carbonates but may effervesce slightly in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  EC is less than 2 mmhos. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.  The Bt is a diagnostic argillic horizon, and in most pedons the Btk is also part of the diagnostic argillic.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  The Bk is a diagnostic calcic horizon with 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe 2C or 2Bk horizon has variable colors depending upon the lithochromic colors of the clean sand and gravel.  Texture is gravelly sand, extremely gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand, loamy sand or sand.  This horizon may be stratified with lenses of sand or gravel.  Rock fragments vary with strata but average from 0 to 70 percent fine and medium quartzitic or granitic gravel.  There is less than 5 percent cobbles present."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Platoro, Relsob, and Tigiwon series.  Platoro and Tigiwon soils do not have calcic horizons.  In addition, the Tigiwon soils have sandy-skeletal material at 10 to 20 inches. Relsob soils are typically noncalcareous throughout; but when carbonates occur above the 2C, they are discontinuous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bosler soils are on gently to moderately sloping relict high terraces, fan aprons, and fan piedmonts.  They formed in medium textured, mixed alluvium over sand and gravel strata. Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow and rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to be 70 to 110 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."

The Alcova, Forelle, and Rock River soils are similar but do not have the strongly contrasting sand and gravel at 20 to 40 inches.  The Ryan Park soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and also do not have contrasting textures at 20 to 40 inches."
