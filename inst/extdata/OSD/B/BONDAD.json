  "OVERVIEW": "The Bondad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources but mostly from sandstone.  Bondad soils are on hillslopes and paleoterrace risers.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
