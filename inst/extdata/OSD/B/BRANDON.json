  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to more than 48 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and from 30 to 80 percent in the 2 Bt and 2C horizons. Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam and the range allows silty clay loam in severely eroded pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture  is silt loam or rarely silt.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have mottles and redox depletions in shades of brown or gray below a depth of 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon.\nThe 2C horizon is variable in color, texture, and structure. Colors are commonly in shades of red, brown, or yellow. Some pedons have redox depletions and variegated parent material colors and/or silt coatings in shades of gray or brown. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have a 2Bt horizon with colors and textures similar to the 2C horizon. Many pedons have sandy or clayey strata within this horizon with gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly modifiers. Many pedons have thin seams of ironstone or sandstone in the 2C horizon. This horizon can vary from 20 to 40 percent brittleness to strongly cemented in some strata and pockets."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Choccolocco, Hallison, and Nixonton series.  Choccolocco soils have few to common rounded quartz gravel throughout and are on nearly level stream terraces and flood plains. Hallison soils formed in Triassic basin siltstone, mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone and have a paralithic contact between 40 to 60 inches. Nixonton soils formed in loamy and silty marine sediments on the lower Coastal Plain and lack gravelly and very gravelly layers in the lower subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gently sloping to steep upland ridges and hillsides. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in a silty mantle, presumably loess, 20 to 40 inches thick, overlying very gravelly or gravelly water deposited materials.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is 58 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 54 inches."

Memphis and Feliciana soils formed in more than 48 inches of loess. Grenada, Loring, and Lax soils have fragipans and are moderately well drained.  Lexington soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick and have loamy sand or sand horizons at depths less than 48 inches. Sengtown soils are fine and formed in limestone residuum.  Minvale soils are fine-loamy and formed in colluvium on footslopes.  Saffell soils have loamy-skeletal textural control sections."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Brandon series was classified as Red-Yellow Podzolic soils in the 1938 classification system.The MLRA soil survey regional responsibility was changed from was Lexington, Kentucky (MO18) to Little Rock Arkansas (MO16) on 1/19/2011. The justification for this change is the concept of Brandon is thin loess over Tertiary gravelly deposits and is not typical of the highland rim.  In addition, the type location is currently located in MO16 and the majority of it is mapped in MLRA 134.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 9 inches (A & E)\nArgillic horizon: 13 to 30 inches (Bt)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
