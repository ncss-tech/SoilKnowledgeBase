  "OVERVIEW": "The Burchflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, tuff, or tuff breccia.  Burchflat soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
