Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Vipont soils have rock fragments of sandstone, quartzite, or mica schist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burchflat soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit or shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, tuff, and tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,135 to 2,535 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 610 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
