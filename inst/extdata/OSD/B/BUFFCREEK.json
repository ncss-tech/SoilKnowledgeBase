  "OVERVIEW": "The Buffcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on pediments, fan remnants and alluvial fans.  Rock fragments are from mixed sources, and the matrix material is derived mainly from red sedimentary rock.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent.
