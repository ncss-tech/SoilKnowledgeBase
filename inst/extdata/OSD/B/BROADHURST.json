  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Colors throughout the soil are largely inherited from the parent rock.  The control section averages between 60 and 70 percent clay.  The soil has an Ustic moisture regime that borders on Aridic.  Consistence is hard to extremely hard when dry and very firm when moist.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 1 inch wide and several feet long extend downward for 20 inches or more.  The soil typically is very strongly acid but ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nA and AC horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Few or common partially weathered very fine fragments of shale are in the C horizon in most pedons.  Nests of gypsum and other salts are few or common in the lower part of the  C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Broadhurst soils are on colluvial fans and terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in clayey material derived from acid shales.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Demar, Graner, and Grummit soils.  Demar soils have argillic horizons and are on similar positions as the Broadhurst soils.  Graner soils are friable throughout and are on adjacent undulating to rolling uplands.  Grummit soils have shale within depths of 20 inches and are on steeper parts of the landscape."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to very high depending on slope.  Permeability is very slow except after dry periods when the initial intake in cracks is rapid."
