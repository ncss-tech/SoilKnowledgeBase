  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Broadhurst series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey material derived from acid shales on colluvial fans and terraces.  These soils have very slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Colors throughout the soil are largely inherited from the parent rock.  The control section averages between 60 and 70 percent clay.  The soil has an Ustic moisture regime that borders on Aridic.  Consistence is hard to extremely hard when dry and very firm when moist.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 1 inch wide and several feet long extend downward for 20 inches or more.  The soil typically is very strongly acid but ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nA and AC horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Few or common partially weathered very fine fragments of shale are in the C horizon in most pedons.  Nests of gypsum and other salts are few or common in the lower part of the  C horizon."

Graner soils are friable throughout and are on adjacent undulating to rolling uplands.  Grummit soils have shale within depths of 20 inches and are on steeper parts of the landscape."
