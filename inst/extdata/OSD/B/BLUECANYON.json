Volcanic glass and ashy modifier added to the A horizon, which reflects the concept as mapped in the Blue Mountains. Samples should be collected from representative sites to confirm the presence of a Vitrandic subgroup feature. Most shallow and very shallow rangeland soils in Eastern Oregon do not recognize significant ash in the surface layer, so the Bluecanyon series stands out as an outlier.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
