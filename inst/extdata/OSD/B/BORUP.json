  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches. The top of the calcic horizon is at depths of less than 16 inches. This soil is typically slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout but is strongly alkaline in the Bk horizon of some pedons. These soils do not have rock fragments to depths of 40 inches or more. In the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section, the average content of noncarbonate clay is less than 18 percent. The calcic horizon has 15 to 45 percent calcium carbonate with as much 35 percent noncarbonate clay. The control section contains less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have an Ak or ABk horizon up to 10 inches thick.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It does not have accumulations of gypsum in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or less and typically has redoximorphic features.  Value of 7 is allowed below depths of 48 inches.  Texture is very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon and/or do not have a Cg horizon.\nA 2C horizon of loamy till or clayey lacustrine sediments or sandy or gravelly sediments begins at depths as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons."

They formed in calcareous lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  The frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 2000 feet."

Augsburg and Wheatville soils have clayey material above 40 inches. Glyndon and Wheatville soils are on slightly higher lying terrain and are somewhat poorly drained. Moderately well drained Gardena soils are on nearby uplands. They do not have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches."
