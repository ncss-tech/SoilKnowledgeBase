  "STATES": "MN,ND,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Borup series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy calcareous lacustrine sediments on lake plains.  These soils have moderate or moderately rapid permeability and slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches. The top of the calcic horizon is at depths of less than 16 inches. This soil is typically slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout but is strongly alkaline in the Bk horizon of some pedons. These soils do not have rock fragments to depths of 40 inches or more. In the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section, the average content of noncarbonate clay is less than 18 percent. The calcic horizon has 15 to 45 percent calcium carbonate with as much 35 percent noncarbonate clay. The control section contains less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have an Ak or ABk horizon up to 10 inches thick.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It does not have accumulations of gypsum in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or less and typically has redoximorphic features.  Value of 7 is allowed below depths of 48 inches.  Texture is very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon and/or do not have a Cg horizon.\nA 2C horizon of loamy till or clayey lacustrine sediments or sandy or gravelly sediments begins at depths as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons."
