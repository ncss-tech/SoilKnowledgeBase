    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broland soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit and backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,768 to 2,286 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
