  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Broland series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from volcanic rocks.  Broland soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
