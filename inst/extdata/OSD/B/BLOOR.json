  "OVERVIEW": "The Bloor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Bloor soils are on fan skirts, axial stream flood plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
