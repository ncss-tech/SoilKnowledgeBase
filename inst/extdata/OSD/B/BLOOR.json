These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 120 days."
