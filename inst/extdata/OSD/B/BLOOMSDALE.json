  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is greater than 80 inches.  Clay content of the particle-size control section averages 24 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or rarely 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4, 6 or 7 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Total rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe Bw or BA horizon is similar to the A horizon with the addition that it includes color value of 5 and chroma of 4.\nThe 2Bw or 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs of silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or clay loam with rock fragments ranging from 25 to 70 percent.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and rarely 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is the very or extremely gravelly analogs of sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay. Rock fragments range from 50 to 80 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bloomsdale soils are on narrow flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  They formed in loamy and clayey alluvium with an increasing coarse fragment content with increasing depth. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gladden,Haymond, Razort soils on similar positions of the flood plain.  On the nearby uplands are Gasconade, Goss, Hildebrecht, Rueter, and Weingarten soils.  Haymond and Ross soils are commonly silt loam to 40 inches or more without any appreciable chert or gravel content.  Gasconade soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Goss soils are clayey-skeletal and formed in cherty residuum.  Hildebrecht and Weingarten soils are fine-silty and formed in thin loess and the underlying cherty residuum. Razort soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic colored surface layer. Rueter soils formed in cherty residuum."
