  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bloomsdale series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium and have an increasing coarse fragment content with increasing depth.  These soils are on narrow flood plains in MLRA 116. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or rarely 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4, 6 or 7 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Total rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe Bw or BA horizon is similar to the A horizon with the addition that it includes color value of 5 and chroma of 4.\nThe 2Bw or 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs of silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or clay loam with rock fragments ranging from 25 to 70 percent.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and rarely 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is the very or extremely gravelly analogs of sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay. Rock fragments range from 50 to 80 percent."

On the nearby uplands are Gasconade, Goss, Hildebrecht, Rueter, and Weingarten soils.  Haymond and Ross soils are commonly silt loam to 40 inches or more without any appreciable chert or gravel content.  Gasconade soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Goss soils are clayey-skeletal and formed in cherty residuum.  Hildebrecht and Weingarten soils are fine-silty and formed in thin loess and the underlying cherty residuum. Razort soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic colored surface layer. Rueter soils formed in cherty residuum."
