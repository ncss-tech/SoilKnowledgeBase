They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and in some areas in colluvium from shale, sandstone or conglomerate.  Elevations are 1,465 to 2,135 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and frost-free season is 80 to 120 days."
