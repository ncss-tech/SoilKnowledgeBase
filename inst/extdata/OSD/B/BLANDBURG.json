This horizon is mainly derived from the leaf litter of oaks, northern hardwoods, hemlock, red spruce and ferns.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bh horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, in the fine-earth fraction. Moist consistence is friable to firm. Manner of failure is weakly or moderately smeary.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or less, chroma of 3 or less. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Moist consistence is friable to firm. Manner of failure is weakly or moderately smeary.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. The Gauley, Hermon, Leetonia, Nipissing and Winnecook series are in closely related families. Gauley soils are moderately deep (51 to 102 cm) to bedrock.  Hermon soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and are formed in granitic glacial till.  Leetonia soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Nipissing soils are moderately deep (51 to 102 cm) to bedrock and formed from glacial lake beach deposits.  Winnecook soils are moderately deep (51 to 102 cm) to bedrock and are formed in glacial till derived from phyllite, slate or shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blandburg soils are on gently sloping ridgetops and side slopes at 640 to 1494 meters (2100 to 4900 feet) elevation. Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. They formed in residual, colluvial or frost-churned materials derived from acid sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 1067 to 1321 mm (42 to 52 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 6 to 7 degrees C. (43 to 45 degrees F.). The frost-free period is about 90 - 120 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Elko, Gaudineer, Gauley, Leatherbark, Mandy, Onoville, Paddyknob, Shinglehouse, Snowdog, Trussel and Wildell soils. Elko, Snowdog and Onoville are moderately well drained, have a fragipan, and do not have a spodic horizon.  Gaudineer soils have more clay and less sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Gauley soils are moderately deep.  Mandy soils are moderately deep and do not meet the definition of spodosol based on iron, aluminum and ODOE values. Paddyknob soils are moderately deep and do not have a spodic horizon.  Leatherbark soils are moderately deep and somewhat poorly drained. Shinglehouse soils are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained and have a fragipan. Trussel soils are very deep, poorly drained have a fragipan, and do not have a spodic horizon. Wildell soils are moderately deep and have mixed mineralogy."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 48 cm (Oi, Oa, A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 13 to 48 cm (E horizon)\nSpodic horizon--the zone from 48 to 76 cm (Bhs and Bs horizons)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 76 cm\nThe 7/2020 revision moves the Type Location and the Typical Pedon for the series to Potter County, PA from Garrett Co. MD where it was never correlated. It also revises the mineralogy class from mixed to siliceous. The revision of the mineralogy class is based on laboratory data and the classification of soils which have formed in materials weathered from the same parent bedrock; these include Dekalb, Gauley, Hazleton, Leetonia, and Paddyknob soils.\nPrevious revisions: 1/84--DLY, CER; 12/05-DLY, CER\nThese soils were previously recognized as members of the Hazleton and Leetonia series in areas where soil temperature studies by the Pennsylvania State University and NRCS have shown that the soil temperature class is frigid.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data are available from Pennsylvania State University for the following pedons sampled as members of the Hazleton series; S71 PA11-1, S71 PA11-2, S71 PA11-3, S67 PA062-001, S67 PA062-002, S78 PA056-005, S78 PA053-007, S78 PA053-008, S79 PA042-007, S88 PA017-039. The data from these pedons support the classification of the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
