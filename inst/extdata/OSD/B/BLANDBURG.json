  "STATES": "PA,WV",
  "OVERVIEW": "Blandburg series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively and excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on gently sloping ridgetops and side slopes. They formed in residual, colluvial or frost-churned materials derived from acid sandstone. Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C (43 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 inches).",

Gauley soils are moderately deep (51 to 102 cm) to bedrock.  Hermon soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and are formed in granitic glacial till.  Leetonia soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Nipissing soils are moderately deep (51 to 102 cm) to bedrock and formed from glacial lake beach deposits.  Winnecook soils are moderately deep (51 to 102 cm) to bedrock and are formed in glacial till derived from phyllite, slate or shale."
