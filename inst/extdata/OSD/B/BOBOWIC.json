  "OVERVIEW": "The Bobowic series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on dissected hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
