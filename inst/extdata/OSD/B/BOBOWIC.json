    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1595, MT3074.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a layer of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves from 1 inch to the mineral soil surface (Oi horizon); an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, E horizons); an albic horizon from 3 to 11 inches (E horizon); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 21 to 34 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 34 inches (R horizon); a cambic horizon from 11 to 21 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 21 inches (E, Bw horizons).  Bobowic soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
