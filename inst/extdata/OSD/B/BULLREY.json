  "REVDATE": "03/2011",
  "STATES": "ID,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bullrey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium from rhyolitic or similar rock sources. Bullrey soils are on alluvial fans and colluvial slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
