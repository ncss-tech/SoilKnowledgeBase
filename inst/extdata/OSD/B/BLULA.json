  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Carbonates are typically leached below a depth of 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness and extends into the Bw horizon of most pedons.  The C horizon contains 2 to 15 percent by volume of soft to hard sandstone fragments that range in size from 1/8 to 3 inches is size.  The fragments typically are calcareous.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly fine sandy loam but includes sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It dominantly is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blula soils are generally on north and east facing back slopes and foot slopes of deeply dissected sandstone plains. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium from soft sandstone with additions of eolian sand in places.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F.; and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 23 inches.  Growing season ranges from 130 to 160 days; growing season precipitation is about 14 to 15 inches; and growing degree days ranges from 2800 to 3000."

The poorly drained Bigwinder soils, the excessively drained Inavale soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Yockey soils are on flood plains.  The excessively drained McKelvie and Peji soils do not have mollic epipedons and are on shoulders and back slopes above the Blula soils."
