  "OVERVIEW": "The Blula series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that are generally on north and east facing back slopes on uplands.  They formed in loamy and sandy material weathered from sandstone with additions of colluvium and eolian sands in places.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Carbonates are typically leached below a depth of 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness and extends into the Bw horizon of most pedons.  The C horizon contains 2 to 15 percent by volume of soft to hard sandstone fragments that range in size from 1/8 to 3 inches is size.  The fragments typically are calcareous.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly fine sandy loam but includes sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It dominantly is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."
