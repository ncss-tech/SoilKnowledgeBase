The soil between depths of 25 to 100 cm is usually dry from May 15 to November 15, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 5.0 degrees C. from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from April 15 to November 30.  The mean annual soil temperature is 8.3 to 15 degrees C.  Base saturation is 90 to 100 percent throughout the profile.  Ash content is 60 to 100 percent by weight.  Fine and medium pumice gravel covers 15 to 50 percent of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/2.  Textures are loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly loamy sand.  Gravel content is 15 to 50 percent for the surface, and is 5 to 15 percent in the lower A horizons.  The gravel is mostly pumice.  The organic carbon content is 0.1 to 0.3 percent.\nThe C horizon color is 7.5YR 8/2; 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 8/1 or 8/2.  Moist color is 7.5YR 6/2; 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 6/1 or 6/2.  Textures are loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.  Gravel content is 5 to 30 percent.  The gravel is mostly pumice."
