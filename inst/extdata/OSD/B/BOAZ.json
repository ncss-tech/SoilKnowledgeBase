  "OVERVIEW": "The Boaz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvial deposits on flood plains.  They have moderate permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 47 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 25 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture typically is silt loam but some pedons have subhorizons of silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or more. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is like the Bg horizon above.\nThe Bg horizon has color and texture like the Bg horizon described above.\nSome pedons have a BCg horizon which has colors and textures like the Bg horizon Described above.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons havethin lenses of silty clay, silt, or very fine sand at depths of 40 inches or more."

Arenzville and Orion soils have dark-colored buried horizons and are coarse-silty.  Ettrick soils have a mollic epipedon and are poorly drained and very poorly drained.  Lawson soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick and are not as gray."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches (Ap); cambic horizon - 9 to 35 inches (Bg, Bw, and Bg); aquic feature - have dominant chroma of 2 or less and saturation in the cambic horizon within 20 inches of the soil surface;  Aeric subgroup - chroma of 3 or more in more than 50 percent of the matrix in at least one subhorizon between the A horizon and 30 inches.\n2006 - Boaz soils were not correlated in the update of Richland County. Therefore, this revision provides a new typical pedon in Monroe County.\nBoaz soils need study. Three counties where they were originally correlated have been updated and Boaz soils were not correlated in any of these updates."
