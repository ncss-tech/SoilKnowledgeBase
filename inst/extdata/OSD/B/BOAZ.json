    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from  moderately acid to neutral throughout the soil.  The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 25 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture typically is silt loam but some pedons have subhorizons of silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or more. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is like the Bg horizon above.\nThe Bg horizon has color and texture like the Bg horizon described above.\nSome pedons have a BCg horizon which has colors and textures like the Bg horizon Described above.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons havethin lenses of silty clay, silt, or very fine sand at depths of 40 inches or more."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. Similar series are the Arenzville, Ettrick, Lawson, and Orion series.  Arenzville and Orion soils have dark-colored buried horizons and are coarse-silty.  Ettrick soils have a mollic epipedon and are poorly drained and very poorly drained.  Lawson soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick and are not as gray."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Boaz soils formed in moderately thick silty alluvium derived from loess-mantled uplands. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F."

The well drained and moderately well drained Arenzville soils are nearby on higher positions in the floodplain than Boaz soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Orion soils are nearby in similar landscape positions.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Ettrick soils are in lower positions in the floodplain than Boaz soils."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Undrained areas are used mostly for pastureland and woodland.  Drained areas are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  Native vegetation is a forest of maple and elm, and some grasses in the understory."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches (Ap); cambic horizon - 9 to 35 inches (Bg, Bw, and Bg); aquic feature - have dominant chroma of 2 or less and saturation in the cambic horizon within 20 inches of the soil surface;  Aeric subgroup - chroma of 3 or more in more than 50 percent of the matrix in at least one subhorizon between the A horizon and 30 inches.\n2006 - Boaz soils were not correlated in the update of Richland County. Therefore, this revision provides a new typical pedon in Monroe County.\nBoaz soils need study. Three counties where they were originally correlated have been updated and Boaz soils were not correlated in any of these updates.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
