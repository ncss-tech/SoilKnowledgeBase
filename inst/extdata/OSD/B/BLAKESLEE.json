  "OVERVIEW": "The Blakeslee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in Wisconsinan age glaciolacustrine sediments and in the underlying stratified glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains and terraces. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Adamstown is tentative series that does not have an OSD on file for comparison. El Dara soils do not have subhorizons with as much as 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Funkstown soils are formed in colluvium and alluvium that is not glacial in origin. Kidami soils have a higher pH in the lower part of the subsoil. Cazenovia, Hilton, Lima, Miami, Rainsville, Rawson, and Shawtown soils have carbonates within the series control section. Pevely soils have a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches. Vaughnsville soils have hues redder than 10YR in the surface layer."

Zion series is listed as a competitor in the SC file, but is coarse-loamy. The SC file will be changed. The Glenhall series is listed as a competitor in the SC file, but its classification will change to Mollic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs by the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 5 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 8 to 26 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Bt4 horizons).\nAquic conditions - from a depth of 20 to 80 inches.\nUdic moisture regime."
