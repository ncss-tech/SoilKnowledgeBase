    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adamstown, Cazenovia, El Dara, Funkstown, Hilton, Kidami, Lima, Miami, Pevely, Rainsville, Rawson, Shawtown, and Vaughnsville series. Adamstown is tentative series that does not have an OSD on file for comparison. El Dara soils do not have subhorizons with as much as 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Funkstown soils are formed in colluvium and alluvium that is not glacial in origin. Kidami soils have a higher pH in the lower part of the subsoil. Cazenovia, Hilton, Lima, Miami, Rainsville, Rawson, and Shawtown soils have carbonates within the series control section. Pevely soils have a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches. Vaughnsville soils have hues redder than 10YR in the surface layer."

Elevation ranges from 570 to 1,100 feet above msl. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 43 inches. The frost free period is 133 to 198 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils that were mapped as Braceville loam, classified as Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Fragiochrepts in the Soil Survey of Ashtabula County, Ohio, published 1973, were converted to the Blakeslee series during the modernization project of that survey.\nThe Mt. Zion series is listed as a competitor in the SC file, but is coarse-loamy. The SC file will be changed. The Glenhall series is listed as a competitor in the SC file, but its classification will change to Mollic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs by the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 5 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 8 to 26 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Bt4 horizons).\nAquic conditions - from a depth of 20 to 80 inches.\nUdic moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon AB-134 for characterization data on the typical pedon, sample numbers 27181 - 27194 from Ashtabula County, Ohio; analysis by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
