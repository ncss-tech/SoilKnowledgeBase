  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blappert series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock. Blappert soils are on mountain slopes and hills. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
