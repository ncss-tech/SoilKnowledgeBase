  "OVERVIEW": "The Birdwood series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits. These soils are on valley sides of sandhills and have slopes ranging from 9 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 48 centimeters (19 inches), and mean annual temperature is 9.5 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.",
