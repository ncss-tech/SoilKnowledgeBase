  "OVERVIEW": "The Berville series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits overlying till on lake plains and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
