Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the outwash and moderately slow in the till."
