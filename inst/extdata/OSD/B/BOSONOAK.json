Arnor, Dermala, and Iwela soils, have greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Augustine, Flugle, Parkelei, and Pinitos soils have greater than 35 percent sand in the control section. Bigbow soils have buried paleosols at moderate depths. Carri, Celacy, Celavar, Elwop, Evpark, Gateson, Nyjack, and Ribera soils are moderately deep to a lithic or paralithic contact. Flugle and Pinitos soils receive less winter precipitation and are not continuously moist, in most years, in some part of the soil moisture control section November through April and have mean annual temperatures above 50 degrees F. Goesling have calcic horizons and would classify in a Calcidic subgroup. Navajita soils formed from the Bandelier Tuff formation and have a significant content of volcanic glass and pararock fragments. Pinitos soils do not allow rock fragments and have hues yellower than 5YR. Lykorly, Orlie, and Parkelei soils have hues yellower than 5YR. Rockybutte soils are moderately deep to fragmental material. Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Gateson, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils receive most of the annual precipitation in the spring and fall and are in LRR-E or LRR-G."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bosonoak soils formed in alluvium and fan alluvium derived from siltstone and shale of the Owl Rock member of the Chinle Formation.  Bosonoak soils are on drainageways and fan remnants on valley sides.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The frost free period is 100 to 135 days."

Bryway and Evpark soils are moderately deep to shale and sandstone.  Highdye, Toldohn, and Vessilla soils are very shallow and shallow to sandstone and shale.
