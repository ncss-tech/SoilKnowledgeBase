Potential competitors not yet reclassified are Falkirk (ND), Garlips (CO), Garza (WY), Lonecone (CO), Obrein (MT), Roseglen (ND), Shawa (CO), and Sheckle (UT) series.  Arnegard soils are moist in the spring and summer.  Bowery and Sheckle soils have no carbonates and are medium acid to neutral.  Falkirk soils have gravelly loam 2C horizons and glacial till within 40 inches.  Garlips and Roseglen soils have calcic horizons.  Garza soils have no visible carbonate accumulations and have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Lobe soils are poorly drained.  Lonecone soils are moderately deep.  Obrein soils have high bulk density and formed in till.  Shawa soils have no carbonates above 40 inches."
