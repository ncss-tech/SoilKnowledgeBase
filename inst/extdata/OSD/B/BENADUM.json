  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Rockmill, Snohomish, Wallkill, and Wunabuna series are in closely related families. Rockmill and Wunabuna soils do not have coprogenous material above a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). In addition, the Wunabuna soils are in the fine textural family. Snohomish soils have 15 to 60 percent volcanic ash in the upper part of the particle-size control section. Wallkill soils are in the fine-loamy textural family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benadum soils are in closed depressions and potholes on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The soils formed in slope alluvium overlying herbaceous organic material and coprogenous material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Houghton, Muskego, and Southwest soils. The very poorly drained Houghton and Muskego soils are on similar landform positions and do not have mineral overwash layers. In addition, Houghton soils do not have coprogenous material above a depth of 129 cm (51 inches). The poorly drained Southwest soils formed in mineral deposits and are on similar landforms but are on slightly higher lying areas."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 61 cm (2 feet) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral part, high in the organic material, and moderately high or moderately low in the underlying coprogenous material. Permeability is moderate in the mineral part, moderately rapid in the organic material, and slow in the underlying coprogenous material."
