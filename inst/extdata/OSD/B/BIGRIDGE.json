  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigridge series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks.  Bigridge soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on Sierra Nevada foothills and mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches, (1219 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, (14 degrees C).",
