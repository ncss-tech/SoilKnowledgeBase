  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 48 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Content of mica flakes typically ranges from none to common throughout the profile; in some pedons, the C horizon has many flakes of mica.  Content of rock fragments typically is 15 to 35 percent, but ranges up to 50 percent in some subhorizons.  Rock fragments range in size from pebbles to stones.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile in unlimed areas.  Most pedons have stones or boulders in and on the surface.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, if it occurs, is less than 8 inches thick, and has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon typically has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, but includes hue of 10YR with value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow are none to common.  The Bt horizon is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Thin layers of sandy clay are in some pedons.\nThe BC horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow are none to common.  The BC horizon is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow are few to many.  The C horizon is loamy saprolite in the fine-earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cheaha, Fruithurst, Montonia, Rawlings, Rion, Rome, Sherwood, State, Sugargrove, Tidings, and Wickham series of the same family, and the Durham soils in a related family.  Cheaha and Rawlings soils have hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, Cheaha soils have greater than 15 percent sandstone cobbles in each horizon.  Fruithurst and Montonia soils have a paralithic contact of weathered sericite schist or slate at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Rome, State and Wickham soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces, and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the solum.  Sherwood soils have hard bedrock at depths of 30 to 60 inches.  Sugargrove soils have a paralithic contact of weathered interbedded siltstone and limestone at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Rion soils have a solum that is 20 to 40 inches thick, and contain less than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the control section.  Tidings soils have a paralithic contact of weathered slate and sandstone at depths of 40 to 60 inches, and have more than 15 percent pebbles in each horizon.  Durham soils have siliceous mineralogy, have less than 5 percent rock fragments throughout the profile, and have 7.5YR hues or yellower in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Buckhead soils are on gently sloping to steep summits and sideslopes in the Piedmont uplands.  Slope ranges from 6 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite or granite gneiss.  Mean annual temperature is in the range of 59 to 62 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is in the range of 45 to 50 inches."

Cecil, Gwinnett, Lloyd, and Pacolet soils are in fine families, and are generally on less sloping landform positions.  Additionally, Gwinnett soils have a paralithic contact of hornblende gneiss at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Wickham soils are on stream terraces.  Rawlings soils are on landform positions similar to those of Buckhead."
