  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 inches to 35 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 inches to 60 inches. Gravel from 0.5 inches to 2 inches in diameter are less than 5 percent in the upper part of the A horizons of most pedons, but range from 0 to 15 percent by volume. Content of gravel ranges from 35 to 60 percent in the lower part of the A horizon and in the B horizon, where present; and from 45 to 90 percent in the C horizon. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral in each horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, and the C horizon, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. In pedons where the lower part of the mollic epipedon has chroma more than 2, the horizon can have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 or 5, and chroma 2. It has few to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow gray. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

Arrington, Egam, Godwin and Lynnville soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Also Lynnville soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick and do not have a gravelly substratum. Cannon and Lobelville soils are fine loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soil formed in 2 to 3 feet of recent silty alluvium underlain by very gravelly to extremely gravelly clayey sediments. Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches."
