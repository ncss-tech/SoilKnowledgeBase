The moderately well drained Downsouth soils form a hydrosequence with the Bethalto soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Edwardsville soils have a mollic epipedon and are in similar landform positions farther from the drainageways.  The poorly drained Mascoutah soils are on lower parts of the landform nearby and they have a mollic epipedon.  The Bethalto soils form a biosequence with the Caseyville and Edwardsville soils.  The well drained Wakenda soils have a mollic epipedon and are on more sloping summits farther from the drainageways."
