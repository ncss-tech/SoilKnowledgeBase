The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and contains less than 7 percent sand.  Sand content of the A and E horizons is less than 10 percent and includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 56 to slightly less than 59 degrees F.\nThe upper part of the control section has properties as follows:  The Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral depending upon liming practices.\nThe Eg or E horizon has value of 4 to 6 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 1 to 3.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an EB or BE horizon.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe middle part of the control section (B and BC) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Redoximorphic iron depletions and concentrations have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is silty clay loam in the upper part and is silty clay loam or silt loam in the lower part.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent in the upper part and is 20 to 30 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral, and ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe lower part of the control section (C) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic iron depletions and concentrations commonly have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bethalto soils are on nearly level or gently sloping summits on till plains.  They are in areas of transition between prairie grass and deciduous forest.  Slope gradients typically are between 1 and 3 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in loess.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 400 to 800 feet above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Caseyville soils, the moderately well drained Winfield soils, and the well drained Menfro soils formed under deciduous forest in areas closer to the drainageways.  The moderately well drained Downsouth soils form a hydrosequence with the Bethalto soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Edwardsville soils have a mollic epipedon and are in similar landform positions farther from the drainageways.  The poorly drained Mascoutah soils are on lower parts of the landform nearby and they have a mollic epipedon.  The Bethalto soils form a biosequence with the Caseyville and Edwardsville soils.  The well drained Wakenda soils have a mollic epipedon and are on more sloping summits farther from the drainageways."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Bethalto soils were formerly included with the Atterberry series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches (Ap, Eg1, and Eg2 horizons).  Albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 15 inches (Eg1 and Eg2 horizons).  Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 15 to 62 inches (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons).  Aquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
