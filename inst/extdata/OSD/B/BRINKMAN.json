  "REVDATE": "09/2001",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brinkman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and in the underlying clayey pedisediment.  Dolostone bedrock is at a depth below 80 inches.  Permeability is moderate in the loess and very slow to slow in the pedisediment.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loess deposits and depth to the clayey pedisediment ranges from 45 to 80 inches but generally is from 60 to 80 inches.  A lithic contact with dolostone bedrock is between a depth of 80 and 120 inches or more.  Thickness of the A horizon, depth to layer of maximum clay content, thickness of the Bt horizon, and depth to dolostone bedrock decrease with increasing gradient on convex slopes.  Clay content of the particle-size control section averages from 20 to 25 percent.  Total sand content is less than 12 percent in the loess and content of fine sand or coarser is 5 percent or less.  Rock fragments are absent in the loess mantle, except in the horizon directly above the clayey pedisediment, which may have up to 5 percent chert fragments.  Dolostone and chert fragments are in the pedisediment.  Total volume of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the clayey pedisediment.  Volume of channers ranges from 5 to 35 percent and volume of flagstones ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 29 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, silty clay, or the channery and flaggy analogues.  Clay content is 35 to 75 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

In the past it was thought to be clayey residuum from dolostone.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 9 inches (A horizon); argillic horizon - zone from approximately 9 to 80 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, and 2Bt6 horizons); udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
