  "OVERVIEW": "The Bendire series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic, igneous or metamorphic rock. Bendire soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
