  "OVERVIEW": "The Baldock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on floodplains and low terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches.",
