Slope is dominantly less than 1 percent but ranges to 4 percent.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F and average annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches including 0.5 to 3.0 feet of snow.  Summers are dry.  The average frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."

Balm, Bowman, Powder, and Wingville soils have mollic epipedons.  Bramwell soils are fine silty and have a calcic horizon.  Letha soils are coarse loamy.  Stanfield soils have a duripan.  These soils all occupy similar landscape positions."
