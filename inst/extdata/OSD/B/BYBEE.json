Bybee soils are on mountains and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 55 percent clay.  Rock fragments average 5 to 25 percent of which 5 to 20 percent are gravel and 0 to 5 percent are cobbles.  A stoneline occurs in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR of 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe 2B and 2C horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or gravelly clay."
