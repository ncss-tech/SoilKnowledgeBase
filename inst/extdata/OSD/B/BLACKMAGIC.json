    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dona Ana, Headquarters, Jagerson, Kidwell, Mohave, and Nutt series. Dona Ana, Headquarters, Mohave, and Nutt soils receive more rainfall and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section between July and October. Jagerson and Kidwell soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. In addition, Jagerson soils allow redder hues in the control section. Kidwell soils are greater than 10 inches to secondary lime, have a thicker epipedon, and have cooler soil temperatures."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Blackmagic soils are on alluvial fan remnants.  Slope ranges from 2 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in material from dominantly igneous alluvium.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters.  Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."

Crosgrain and Pioneer soils are on ballenas and eroded fan remnants and do not have argillic horizons. In addition, Crosgrain soils are shallow to a duripan and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Pioneer soils are shallow to a cambidic duripan and have loamy particle-size control sections."
