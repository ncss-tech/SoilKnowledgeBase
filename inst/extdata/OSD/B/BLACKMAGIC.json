  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackmagic series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in dominantly igneous alluvium.  The Blackmagic soils are on alluvial fan remnants.  Slope ranges from 2 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

Dona Ana, Headquarters, Mohave, and Nutt soils receive more rainfall and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section between July and October. Jagerson and Kidwell soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. In addition, Jagerson soils allow redder hues in the control section. Kidwell soils are greater than 10 inches to secondary lime, have a thicker epipedon, and have cooler soil temperatures."
