  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches) (A horizon)\nThese soils were previously mapped with the Dix soils, but they lack a mollic epipedon and average about 15 to 35 percent gravel by volume in the series control section, but some layers have 60 percent or more gravel by volume.  The beds of granitic gravelly material in which these soils formed are coarser nearest the source and become more variable in composition and layer thickness as you move away from the source.  The geomorphic landscape on which these soils occur remains reasonably uniform throughout the area of occurrence and the interpretations do not change.  It is difficult, therefore, to determine the gravel content in the series control section that best represents the series concept.  The soil survey in Sioux County supports greater than 35 percent by volume of gravel, while others to the east support less than 35. Interpretations and map unit composition are about the same.  At this time it appears futile and impractical to map 2 soils.  For now, similar soils that range from 35 to 60 percent by volume of gravel in the series control section will be included with the Blueridge series and documented accordingly in the appropriate correlation documents. Further study is needed for final placement in Taxonomy.\nLast updated by LM and JCR in 09/2005 to include metric conversion and changing permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Pedon S90NE-069-031 sampled and described for NSSL.\nhttp://ssldata.sc.egov.usda.gov/rptExecute.asp?p=17693&r=1&submit1=Get+Report\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
