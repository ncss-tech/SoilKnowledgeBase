  "OVERVIEW": "The Bavaria series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Bavaria soils are on stream terraces on river valleys in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills MLRA 74. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

Changed to semi-tabular format. Added quadrangle, latitude and longitude. Added soil temperature regime, soil moisture regime, mean annual soil temperature, particle clay and sand content. Added sand and clay content in RIC. Updated competing series. Updated geographic setting. Updated geographically associated soils. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\n06/2020 DJK\nMinor formatting changes to meet current standards."
