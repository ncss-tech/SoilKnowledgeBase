(Bkn horizon)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: In the zone from 89 to 200 cm (35 to 79 inches). (Bkn, C horizons)\nKeys to soil Taxonomy: Twelfth edition, 2014\n08/2011 GLP\nAdded metric conversions. Changed to semi-tabular format. Added quadrangle, latitude and longitude. Added soil temperature regime, soil moisture regime, mean annual soil temperature, particle clay and sand content. Added sand and clay content in RIC. Updated competing series. Updated geographic setting. Updated geographically associated soils. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\n06/2020 DJK\nMinor formatting changes to meet current standards.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Physical and chemical data for two pedons are available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory: 87KS169003 and 87KS169004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
