  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 28 inches.  Carbonates are below depths of 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is fine sandy loam, but the range includes loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is fine sandy loam and less commonly loam or loamy very fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is fine sandy loam, but loamy very fine sand is included.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam through fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brunswick soils are on gently sloping to steeply sloping uplands with gradients ranging from 3 to 30 percent.  The Brunswick soil formed in residuum weathered from soft sandstone bedrock.   The mean annual air temperature varies from 47 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation varies from 21 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bazile, Doger, Ortello, Paka, Thurman and Trent soils.  The Bazile, Paka and Trent soils contain more clay in the solum and have mollic epipedons.  They generally occur above Brunswick soils.  Doger and Thurman soils are deep and have a mollic epipedon.  Ortello soils are deep and formed in eolian sand or sandy glacial deposits.  Doger, Ortello and Thurman soils occur above Brunswick soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Brunswick soils were called Holt fine sandy loam on earlier surveys.  These soils contain appreciable volcanic glass and border on an ashy mineralogy.  Further study is needed for verification of the family.\nSome laboratory characterization data indicates the soil has an argillic horizon and would classify as Udic Haplustalfs.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab sample numbers 73L662 to 73L667 from the type location were analyzed by the Soil Survey Investigations Unit, Lincoln, Nebraska.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
