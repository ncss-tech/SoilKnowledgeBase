The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches and extends into the upper part of the Bt horizon in many pedons. Rock fragments are typically lacking throughout the profile. The particle size control section has less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days for the 120 days following the summer solstice.  It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days per year in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silty clay loam, silt loam or silty clay.  The reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam averaging 35 to 60 percent clay.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC or Bk horizon when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam or silty clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is typically stratified or varved with textures of silty clay loam, silt loam or silty clay with thin lenses of loamy very fine sand or very fine sand between strata. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
