    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, they are dry less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 4 and 12 inches following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is less than 9 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  The texture control section averages more than 35 percent clay.  Moist chromas of 2 or less occur between 22 and 30 inches.  Water worn gravel may occur in some pedons.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry with 27 to 40 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizons have value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry with 40 to 60 percent clay.\nThe BCtg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It averages 35 to 60 percent clay with chroma of 2 or less within the particle-size control section and is well drained."

Fendal soils are 20 to 40 inches thick to a paralithic contact and lack an argillic horizon.  Grindbrook soils average less than 35 percent clay in the texture control section and lack an argillic horizon.  Hebo soils are poorly drained and lack argillic horizons.  Reedsport and Tolovana soils are on adjacent mountain areas and average less than 35 percent clay in the texture control section.  Reedsport soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Tolovana soils are dominated by bulk densities less than 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter."
