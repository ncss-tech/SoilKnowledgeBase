  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beaverslide series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on stream terraces, fan remnants, alluvial fans and depressions. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
