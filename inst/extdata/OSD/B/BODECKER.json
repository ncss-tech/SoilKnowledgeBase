  "OVERVIEW": "The Bodecker series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in fan or stream alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
