  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bosland soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The soils formed in mixed colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanics. Elevations are 61 to 396 meters (200 to 1,300 feet). The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). The mean annual precipitation is 2286 to 3302 millimeters (90 to 130 inches).  The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."

Umbric epipedon - from 3 to 31 centimeters.  (A1, A2 horizons) The thickness of the dark colored surface is more than 1/3 the thickness of the solum.\n2. Cambic horizon - from a depth of 31 to 69 centimeters. (Bw1, Bw2 horizons)\n3. Particle-size control section - from 28 to 100 centimeters (11 to 40 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, and C horizons).\n4. Depth to a lithic contact - 100cm.\nHumic Dystrudepts feature - the soil has a base saturation (assumed) of less than 50 percent by ammonium acetate in some subhorizon between depths of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 and 40 inches), and has 21 kilograms of organic carbon per square meter form the surface to 100 centimeters (40 inches).\nSoil classified using the 11th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNASIS User Pedon ID 85OR015002\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
