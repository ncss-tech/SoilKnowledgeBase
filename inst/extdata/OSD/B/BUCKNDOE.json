Chicosa, Katzine, Upler and Yatne soils do not have petrocalcic horizons.  Saraton soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Tinaja soils average 18 to 30 percent clay and are moist in the late spring and early summer months. Twobutte soils are moderately deep to hard caliche bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buckndoe soils are on fan terraces on plateaus at elevations of 4600 to 5500 feet.  These soils formed in tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 160 days."
