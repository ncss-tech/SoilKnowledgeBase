  "OVERVIEW": "The Baldmountain series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from metamorphic or metasedimentary rock.  Baldmountain soils are on uplands with slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",

The soil between depths of about 8 and 24 inches usually becomes moist in some part of late October or November and remains moist until mid-May or June.  Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is silt loam or loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay.  The soil is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR or 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4, and moist color of 7.5YR or 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It has weak or moderate very fine to medium subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe Bw1 horizon has dry color of 7.5YR or 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4 or 5/3, and moist color of 7.4YR or 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  The Bw2 has dry color of 7.5YR or 10YR 3/4, 4/3 or 4/4.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 7.5YR or 10YR 5/4 or 5/6, and moist color of 7.5YR or 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4 or 5/6.
