Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is silt loam or loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay.  The soil is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR or 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4, and moist color of 7.5YR or 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It has weak or moderate very fine to medium subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe Bw1 horizon has dry color of 7.5YR or 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4 or 5/3, and moist color of 7.4YR or 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.

They formed in material weathered from Pre-Cretaceous metasedimentary and metamorphic, and Pre-Cenozoic metamorphic rocks.  Elevations are 7,500 to 9,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 75 to 150 days."
