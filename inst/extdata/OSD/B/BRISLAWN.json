  "OVERVIEW": "The Brislawn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over weathered porcelanite.  The soils are moderately deep to fragmental material.  Brislawn soils are on fans remnants, terraces, broad ridges and on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
