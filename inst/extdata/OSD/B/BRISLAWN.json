    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brislawn soils are on fans remnants, terraces, broad ridges and plateaus.  They formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over weathered porcelanite or very channery slopewash derived from porcelanite.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
