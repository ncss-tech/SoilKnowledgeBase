The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C., from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from April 15 to November 30.  Summer thundershowers occur but are sporadic and usually do not wet the control section; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C.; Extrapolated from actual temperature transect data using Rod Arkley's equation.\nDepth to bedrock: 152 cm or more.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nParticle-size control section - Rock and pararock fragments: 35 to 70 percent, mainly pumice paragravel and obsidian gravel.\nA horizons\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nTexture: Ashy sand, ashy loamy sand, or paragravelly ashy sand.\nPararock fragments: 5 to 30 percent.\nStructure: Single grain or massive.\nVolcanic glass content: 30 to 60 percent in coarse silt through very coarse sand fractions.\nC horizon\nValue: 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist.\nChroma: 1 or 2 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nPararock fragments: 35 to 60 percent; cobbles and stones are 0 to 10 percent, with cobbles predominating.\nVolcanic glass content: 30 to 60 percent in coarse silt through very coarse sand fractions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Benemes soils are on lake terraces and volcanic craters such as Panum Crater near Mono Lake.  These soils formed in rhyolitic volcanic ash and pumice.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,985 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, much of it as snow.  Precipitation ranges are extrapolated from data at weather stations in Pumice Valley and Mono Lake.  The mean January temperature is about -2 degrees C. and the mean July temperature is about 19 degrees C.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 115 to 135 days."
