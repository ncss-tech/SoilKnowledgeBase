  "OVERVIEW": "The Bangtail series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in sedimentary residuum and colluvium. These soils are on hills, mountains, and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.",
