  "OVERVIEW": "The Beaumont series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on coastal plains. These nearly level soils formed in clayey sediments on the Beaumont Formation of the Pleistocene Age. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).",
