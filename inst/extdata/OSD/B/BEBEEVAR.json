The Escawetter series overlap existing series and are inactive. Lesbois soil have a seasonal water table as high as 50 cm and experience different climate patterns in MLRA 11 and Land Resource Area B.  Labyrinth soils occur in MLRA 34 and have an ustic aridic soil moisture regime.  Carwalker and Sagouspe soils have a soil moisture regime bordering on xeric."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bebeevar soils are on inter-channel bars of low, braided flood plains along perennial streams. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, granite, and quartzite. Eolian re-working is occurring in some areas. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 5,610 feet (1402 to 1710 meters). The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches (127 to 254 mm). The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F (10 to 14 degrees C). The average frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."

Walrees soils have a contrasting particle-size class and are in lower, more frequently flooded channel areas. Escavada soils are drier and occur on higher flood plains.
