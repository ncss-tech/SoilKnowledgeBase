  "OVERVIEW": "The Bebeevar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, granite, and quartzite. Bebeevar soils are on inter-channel bars of low, braided flood plains along perennial streams. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches (178 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C).",
