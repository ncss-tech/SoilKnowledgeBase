The Bangor, Berkshire, Groveton and Houghtonville soils do not contain free carbonates within 60 inches. The Becket, Dixfield, Marlow, Mundal, Plaisted and Potsdam soils are underlain by dense glacial till between depths of 40 to 60 inches. Chatham soils contain free carbonates at depths from 40 to 60 inches. The Chesuncook, Dekapen and Lombard soils have a paralithic contact of weathered bedrock within 60 inches.  The Elliottsville, Michigamme, Onota, Penquis, Rawsonville, Revel, Tunbridge  and Welcome series have a lithic contact within 60 inches."
