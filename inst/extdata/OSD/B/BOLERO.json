    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bolero soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitoid or gneissic rocks. Elevations range from 475 to 950 meters (1,558 to 3,116 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

TheBlackeagle, Ironage, and Supplymine soils are on similar landscape positions and Dalelake soils are on sandsheets adjacent to or partially covering lower mountain slopes. Blackeagle, Ironage and Supplymine soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. In addition, Ironage and Supplymine soils have a diagnostic calcic horizon. Blackeagle soils have a cambic horizon. Dalelake soils have sandy particle-size control section, are formed in eolian materials and are very deep."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nC horizon - from a depth of 0 to 15 centimeters.\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 15 to 18 centimeters (A horizon).\nLithic contact - the zone beginning at 49 centimeters (R horizon).\nParticle-size control section - from a depth of 25 to 49 centimeters (part of\nthe Bk and the Ck horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The Bw, Bk and Ck horizons, when present, are either too thin, have insufficient accumulation of carbonates or clay, do not meet color change requirements, are too low in calcium carbonate equivalence, or have some combination of these factors which prevents the horizon from being considered a diagnostic cambic or calcic horizon. Ck horizons with total rock fragments greater than 90 percent are dominantly gravel with pockets of soil material filling fractures between gravel.
