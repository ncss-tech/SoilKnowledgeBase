  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is 5 to 10 feet. Stones range from 0 to 10 percent in the upper part of the solum or on the surface. Rock fragments of fine quartzite gravel range from 0 to 15 percent in the 2Bt and 2C horizons. The soil, if unlimed, is strongly acid to extremely acid; if limed, it is neutral to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Value of 2 or 3 is confined to undisturbed A horizons less than 6 inches thick. The texture of the A horizon ranges from loam to silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2 with mottles in shades of red, yellow and brown. Textures are loam or silt loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2 with mottles in shades of red, yellow and brown. The B horizon is silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon is strongly gleyed and has hue commonly greener or bluer than 5Y unless mottled. Some pedons have a mottled C horizon in which high-chroma colors dominate. The C horizon is silt loam, loam, sandy loam or silty clay loam, but some pedons have thin clay loam subhorizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Chatuge series in the only other series in this family. Chatuge soils are formed in loamy sediments on low stream terraces, are underlain by gravelly coarse sand and are commonly flooded, and have mean annual precipitation greater than 70 inches.  The Armagh, Elkton, Fallsington,  Kinkora, Othello, Purdy, Roanoke, Shrewsbury and Worsham series are in closely related families. The Armagh, Elkton, Kinkora, Purdy, Roanoke and Worsham soils have a clayey particle size control section and a thermic temperature regime.  Fallsington soils have active cation-exchange activity classes and do not have bedrock within 5 to 10 feet; also, they have Bt horizons with sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Othello soils have a fine-silty particle size control section. Shrewsbury soils have active cation-exchange activity classes, sandy clay loam Bt horizons and also have glauconite in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Baile soils are on upland depressions and footslopes in the northern Piedmont Plateau. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. These soils developed in contrasting materials of silty local alluvium over residuum from acid crystalline rocks, chiefly mica schist and granitized schist and gneiss. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 40 inches."

The somewhat excessively drained Brandywine, well drained Chester, Elioak and Glenelg, and well to somewhat excessively drained Manor soils are on associated uplands. The moderately well to somewhat poorly drained Codorus, well drained Comus, and poorly drained Hatboro are on adjacent flood plains. The moderately well to somewhat poorly drained Glenville soils have a fragipan."
