  "OVERVIEW": "The Bishop series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks.  The Bishop soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

It ranges from sandy loam to light clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y and has distinct to prominent mottles of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Mottling becomes more pronounced with depth.  Below the control section the C horizon is stratified and of variable texture."
