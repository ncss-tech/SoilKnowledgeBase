  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil ahs an Ustic moisture regime that borders on Aridic.  Depth to sandstone ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments ranging in size from channery sandstone fragments up to massive slabs of sandstone about 3 feet in diameter are on the surface and mixed throughout the A and C horizons.  Some pedons also have rounded cobble and stones of igneous and metamorphic rocks unrelated to the underlying sedimentary sandstone.  The coarse fragments and flagstones make up 10 to 35 percent by volume of the soil mass.  The control section typically is loam averaging between 15 and 25 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1.5 to 3 dry or moist.  Where the color value is as dark or darker than 5.5 and 3.5 moist, the A horizon is too thin for a mollic epipedon.  The A horizon is cobbly loam, cobbly fine sandy loam, stony loam, stony fine sandy loam, channery loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon typically has 10YR hue, but some pedons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR due to variations in color of the underlying sandstone, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The C horizon is cobbly loam, channery loam, stony loam, stony fine sandy loam, channery fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam and fine sandy loam.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  In some pedons there is an incipient cambic horizon 1 to 2 inches thick that is intermediate in color between the A and C horizon and has more pronounced structure than the C horizon.  It is not continuous and is irregular in its shape and occurrence.\nThe R horizon is very hard sandstone and is hard and difficult to penetrate.  It lacks free carbonates."

The Butche soils are formed in loamy materials weathered from noncalcareous sandstone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches.  Elevations range from 3000 to 5500 feet."

Boneek soils are on high terraces above the Butche soils and have fine argillic horizons.  Canyon and Spearfish are on similar landscapes.  They have carbonates and paralithic beds within depths of 20 inches. Lakoa soils are on north-facing wooded slopes and are deep soils with argillic horizons.  Nevee soils are formed in deep calcareous alluvium and are on fans and terraces below the Butche soils."
