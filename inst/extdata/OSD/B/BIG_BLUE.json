  "OVERVIEW": "The Big Blue series consists of deep, poorly or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary rock. These soils are on floodplains and terraces and have slopes from 0 to 6 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches but typically is 14 to 18 inches thick. The control section is calcareous in all parts between depths of 10 to 20 inches, but is noncalcareous in the lower part in some pedons. Continuous concentrated horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate do not occur within the control section although some visible carbonate or other accumulation is present in some pedons at any depth as a characteristic of the parent material. The control section is heavy clay loam, silty clay or clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 50 percent silt and 10 to 55 percent sand. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter. The solum ranges from mildly to strongly\nalkaline. The average annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 44 degrees F., and average summer soil temperature is 61 degrees to 63 degrees F. without an 0 horizon. A seasonally high water table ranges from one-half to one foot from the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 0 through 4.\nThe Cg horizon where present, has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 0 through 2. Textures of gravelly or cobbly sand occur in this horizon at depths below 50 inches."

Clearwater soils have much higher rates of mean annual precipitation (21 inches) at lower elevations and longer frost-free periods of about 30 days. The Brownton soils lack salts at or near the surface. The Egas soils have Csa horizons in the control section. The Brownton and Egas soils also have mesic temperatures."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches with a spring and summer peak rainfall pattern. The frost free period is 90 to 100 days and the mean annual temperature is 38 degrees to 42 degrees F."
