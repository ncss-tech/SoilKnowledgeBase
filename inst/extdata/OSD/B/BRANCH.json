The well drained Boyer, Fox, and Oshtemo soils are also associated in some places. Boyer and Oshtemo soils do not have iron depletions and do not have sandy surface layers more than 51 cm (20 inches) thick. Fox soils have loamy surface layers, average more clay in the argillic horizons, are browner, and have thinner sola."
