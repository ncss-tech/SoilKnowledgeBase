  "OVERVIEW": "The Banbury series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  Banbury soils are on hills, terraces, terrace plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe classification of this pedon has been revised as of 4/00 from loamy, mixed, mesic Lithic Xerollic Haplargids to loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids based on revision to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
