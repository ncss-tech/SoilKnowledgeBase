  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Banbury soils are on hills, terraces, lava flow lobes, pressure ridges and tumuli on shield volcanoes and lava plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in old alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,500 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches.  Average annual temperature is 49 degrees to 54 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 150 days."

Emberton soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Fathom soils occur on lower terraces and breaks, are sandy, and very deep.  Owinza soils occur on depressional terraces, are fine, and very deep."

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe classification of this pedon has been revised as of 4/00 from loamy, mixed, mesic Lithic Xerollic Haplargids to loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids based on revision to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
