Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nWhere present, an AB or BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe second part of the series control section (Bt horizon) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blackberry soils are on loess covered outwash plains, stream terraces and till plains of Wisconsinan age. They formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 76 to 114 cm (30 to 45 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brenton, Clare, Drummer, Elburn, Flanagan, and Proctor soils. The somewhat poorly drained Brenton, Elburn and Flanagan soils are on slightly lower lying landform positions. The moderately well drained Clare and well drained Proctor soils are on similar landform positions where the loess cap is thinner. The poorly drained Drummer soils are in slight depressions or on low-lying parts of the landform below the Blackberry soils."

An intermittent apparent water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the outwash. Permeability is moderate in the loess and moderate or moderately rapid in the outwash."
