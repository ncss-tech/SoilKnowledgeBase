Bauscher soils lack volcanic ash in the soil\nand have more than 30 percent fine sand and coarser.  Brinegar soils\nare moderately well drained.  DeMasters and Pinehurst soils have \"O\"\nhorizons.  DeMasters soils are skeletal in the lower part of the\nargillic horizon.  Pinehurst soils have a 5YR hue and are moderately or\nstrongly acid in the lower part of the profile.  Watchabob soils are\nmoderately deep to bedrock."

The soil formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.\nThe annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, most of which\nfalls as snow and early spring rain.  The annual air temperature ranges\nfrom 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
