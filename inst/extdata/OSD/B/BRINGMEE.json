  "OVERVIEW": "The Bringmee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that\nformed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Bringmee soils are on stream\nterraces and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.\nPermeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is\nabout 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43\ndegrees F.",
