  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 140 cm. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm. Rock fragment content throughout the soil is less than 5 percent by volume. Stones cover from 0 to 3 percent of the surface. Iron depletions occur within 61 cm of the mineral soil surface. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface horizon, unless limed, from strongly acid to neutral in the subsoil, and from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, with value and chroma of 2 to 5. Some undisturbed areas have an A horizon 3 to 15 cm thick, that has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, with value and chroma of 2 to 5. They are silt loam or silty clay loam. They have weak to strong, very fine to medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8, with chroma of 2 being inherited. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular, very fine to coarse blocky or thin to thick platy structure. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. It has blocky or platy structure or has primary structure that is prismatic. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It has blocky, platy or prismatic structure, all of which are considered inherited, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Common or many black to dark reddish brown patchy oxide coatings are on faces of peds. Some pedons have films on faces of peds that appear to be silt."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in the same family. Similar soils in related families are the Boothbay and Elmwood series. Boothbay soils have a fine-silty particle-size class. Elmwood soils have a coarse-loamy over clayey particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buxton soils are on coastal lowlands and river valleys. Slope ranges from 3 to 50 percent. The soils formed in medium, moderately fine, and fine textured glaciolacustrine or glaciomarine deposits. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 860 to 1220 mm, and mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 8 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 2 to 274 meters above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biddeford, Elmwood, Lamoine, Melrose, Scantic, Swanton and Whately soils. The very poorly drained Biddeford soils are in depressions on the landscape. The somewhat poorly drained Lamoine soils and poorly drained Scantic soils are in lower positions on the landscape. The Elmwood, Melrose, Swanton, and Whately soils all have a coarse-loamy over clayey particle-size class. Elmwood soils are in similar positions on the landscape; Melrose soils are in higher positions; Swanton soils are in lower positions and Whately soils are in depressions."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Cleared areas are used mainly for hay, forage crops, or pasture. Some areas are used for silage corn or vegetables. The remaining areas are forested. Common tree species include eastern white pine, balsam fir, paper birch, white spruce, eastern hemlock, and northern red oak."
