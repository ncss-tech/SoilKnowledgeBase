  "OVERVIEW": "The Busterback series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and alluvium.  Busterback soils are on outwash fans and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part. Slopes  are 2 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
