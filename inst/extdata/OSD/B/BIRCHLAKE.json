    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Free calcium carbonate is at depths of 12 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up about 1 to 4 percent of the volume of the horizons.  The particle size control section contains more that 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  The lower part of the series control section contains more than 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2  or 3, and chroma of 1.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btk, Bk and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Doran soils formed in a 15 to 40 inch thick lacustrine mantle overlying glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity.  Mehurin soils have less than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section."

The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 26 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."
