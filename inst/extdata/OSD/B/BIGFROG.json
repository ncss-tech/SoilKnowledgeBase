  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Bedrock is at a depth of greater than 60 inches.   The thickness of the solum and depth to the duripan is 8 to 18 inches.  The particle size control section averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragments mainly as gravel, and 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and a chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.  It has 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkqm horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is 6 to 20 inches thick.\nThe C horizon is stratified very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam and very gravelly loamy sand.  It has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and a clay content of 5 to 25 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acana, Argalt, Bartome, Bruncan, Chuckridge, Chuska, Colthorp, Dewar, Grassval, Handpah, Packwood, Pipeline, Roseworth, Thoms, and Wellington soils.  Acana soils have a strongly calcareous argillic horizon and are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the subsoil, duripan and substratum.  Argalt, Bruncan, Chuska, Colthorp and Packwood soils have bedrock immediately under the duripan.  Chuckridge, Handpah, Pipeline and Wellington soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 degree F or warmer and have a frost-free season of over 100 days.  Grassval soils are calcareous throughout the profile.  Roseworth soils have carbonates at 6 to 13 inches.  Thoms soils are slightly acid or neutral and have hue of 5YR in the subsoil.  Bartome soils have a duripan at 14 to 20 inches, and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments, and 18 to 26 percent clay in the particle-size control section; this series cannot be separated adequately from Bigfrog nor can it be expanded adequately to incorporate Bigfrog soils.  Dewar soils have a duripan at 14 to 20 inches and the pan is over 20 inches thick."

Elevations are 4,200 to 5,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.  The frost free period is 80 to 100 days."
