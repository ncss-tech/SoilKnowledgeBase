(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on October 1976, the soil was dry throughout.)  About 60 percent of the surface covered by rock fragments consisting of 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones.\nA1--0 to 3 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely stony fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; 35 percent gravel; 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones (25 to 30 cm in diameter); strongly effervescent, disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)\nA2--3 to 18 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely stony fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel 2 to 5mm in size, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; strongly effervescent, disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 28 cm thick)\nR--18 cm; hard basalt with few fractures, no displacement of fragments."

The upper part is moist for about 10 days between June and September, due to thunder showers.  The soils are continuously moist for 30 to 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature is warmer than 8 degrees C; typic aridic soil moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature: 13 to 15 degrees C.\nDepth to a lithic contact: 10 to 25 cm.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline through moderately alkaline.\nEffervescence: Slightly effervescent through strongly effervescent.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 70 percent.\nA horizon\nChroma 2 or 3."

Pintwater soils have a Bqk horizon and depth to hard bedrock is 25 to 50cm.  Singatse soils lack moisture in the upper part caused by summer convection storms during June through September. Cadrina, Sojur, Tsaya and Walknolls soils have more that 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are dominated by channers."

The soils formed in material derived from extrusive basis igneous rocks.  Elevations are 1,254 to 1,980 meters in California and ranges to 2,130 meters in Nevada.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers with infrequent thunder showers of short duration; and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  Mean January temperature is 4 degrees C, mean July temperature is 27 degrees C, mean annual temperature is 11 to 12 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 140 to 235 days."
