  "OVERVIEW": "The Budlewis series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a duripan that formed in alluvium and loess from mixed sources and residuum from basalt.  They are on terraces, calderas, foothills, structural benches, and tablelands.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
