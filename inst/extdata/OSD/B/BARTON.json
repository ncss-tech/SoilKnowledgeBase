  "OVERVIEW": "The Barton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rocks.  Barton soils are on hills.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
