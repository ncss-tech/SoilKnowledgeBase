  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barton soils are on hills above the surrounding lake plain of Great Salt Lake.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rocks such as tillite, fluvial conglomerate, varved slate, and graywacke.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Leland soils are fine-loamy, have ochric epipedons and natric horizons, and occur on lake terraces.  Saltair soils are fine-silty, have ochric epipedons and salic horizons, and occur on lake plains.  Warm Springs soils are fine-loamy, have calcic horizons, and occur on lake terraces."
