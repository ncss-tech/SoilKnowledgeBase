  "OVERVIEW": "The Balman series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from basic igneous rocks. Balman soils are on lake terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 to 488 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This soil is moistened from capillary rise from a fluctuating water table as well as by precipitation.  It remains moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches from mid-November until the middle of July.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 48 to 50 degrees F.  Soil temperatures at a depth of 20 inches exceed 41 degrees F from March 15 to November 15 and 47 degrees F from April 1 to November 1.\nThe 10 to 40 inches control section is dominantly loam and averages 18 to 28 percent clay.  Some strata of sandy loam or fine sandy loam are present in some pedons.  Exchangeable sodium is 2 to 25 percent in the upper 15 inches of the soil profile and averages less than 1 percent in the horizons below a depth of 15 inches.  Calcium carbonate is about 15 and 25 percent, and averages 1 to 5 percent below a depth of 25 inches.  The upper boundary of the calcic horizon is within 10 inches of the surface.  Abrupt stratification is lacking.  Lime is generally disseminated but some pedons have filaments and threads of lime in the mid-part of the profile. The A and upper C horizons are moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon is light gray and very pale brown to brown (10YR 7/3, 7/2, 7/1, 6/3, 6/2, 6/1, 5/2, 5/1; 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2, 5/2) dry and moist colors are brown, grayish brown, and dark grayish brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue. It has weak or moderate medium to thin platy structure, commonly with vesicular pores.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the A horizon and in addition light olive gray, pale yellow or pale olive (6.3) in 5Y hue.  The upper part of the C horizon ranges from clay loam to sandy loam.  Below depth of 40 inches the C horizons are stratified and range from sand to clay.  The lower part of the C horizon is moderately alkaline to neutral."
