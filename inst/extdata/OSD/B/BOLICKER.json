  "OVERVIEW": "The Bolicker series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over colluvium derived from basalt. Bolicker soils are on canyon walls, slumpblocks, and footslopes. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
