The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.

These soils formed in loess over colluvium derived from basalt. Elevation is 800 to 2,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free season is 135 to 160 days."

Walla Walla soils are coarse-silty and lack secondary lime within the particle-size control section. Asotin and Schuelke soils are on canyon side slopes. Nims soils are on basalt plateaus. Walla Walla soils are on hills."
