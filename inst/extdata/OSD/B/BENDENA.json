Sogn soils are Haplustolls and typically are in a drier climate.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon include: mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 20 centimeters, lithic contact - bedrock at 20 to 30 centimeters.\n09/2008 GJJ changed from loamy to clayey, removed mixed, superactive and replaced with smectitic, fixed range in characteristics, added metric conversions, removed English\nunits, and made some format changes.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
