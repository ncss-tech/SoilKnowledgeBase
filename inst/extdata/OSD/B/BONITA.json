  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonita series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from basalt and related pyroclastic rock.  Bonita soils are on plateaus, fan piedmonts and relict basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
