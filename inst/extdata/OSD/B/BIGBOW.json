  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigbow series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, eolian loess deposits of Holocene age. These soils are on level to gently sloping plains and interdunes of the Southern High Plains, Northern part (MLRA 77A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
