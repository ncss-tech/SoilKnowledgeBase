  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearmouth series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, outwash or till derived from mixed sources. These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, outwash plains, moraines, fan remnants, alluvial fans and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F",
