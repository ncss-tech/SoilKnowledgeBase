The particle size control section averages between 35 and 90 percent rock fragments by volume and greater than 70 percent fine sand or coarser. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon. The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A and E horizons are loamy sand, sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam or very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bhs horizon is coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bete Grise soils are in slightly depressional areas and drainageways on glacial lake benches, stream terraces and outwash plains underlain by cobbly and gravelly till.  The upper deposits were formed in cobbly, gravelly and sandy glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits.  The substratum was formed in cobbly and gravelly till. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 36 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."

The moderately well drained Copper Harbor soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. Nipissing soils are moderately deep, well drained soils on bedrock benches.  The somewhat poorly drained Gratiot soils are on similar landscape positions and formed in gravelly and cobbly sandy loam glacial till. The very poorly drained Tawas soils are in the lowest depressions and drainageways and formed in organic material over sandy deposits."
