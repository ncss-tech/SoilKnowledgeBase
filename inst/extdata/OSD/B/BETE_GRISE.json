  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bete Grise series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on glacial lake benches, stream terraces and outwash plains underlain by cobbly and gravelly till.  The upper deposits were formed in cobbly, gravelly and sandy glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits.  The substratum was formed in cobbly and gravelly till.  Permeability is rapid.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
