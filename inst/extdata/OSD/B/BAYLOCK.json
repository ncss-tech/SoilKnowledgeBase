    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ginat, Laconia, and Sunken series. The Ginat soils have a shallower argillic horizon and they formed in silty alluvium in the Ohio River drainage basin. Laconia soils have a 2Btg horizon with a higher content of clay and occur in depressions on karst landscapes.  Sunken soils have a 2Btg horizon with a higher content of sand and formed in loamy eolian or alluvial sediments."
