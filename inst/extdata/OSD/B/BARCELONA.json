  "OVERVIEW": "The Barcelona series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments and the underlying till. They are on lake plains with bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Westboro (T) soils do not have bedrock between 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Aptakisic, Creal, Fitchville, Hatmaker, Iva, Kendall, Starks, Stronghurst, Waynetown, and Yeddo (T) series may be in the same family when they are classified to the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Aptakisic and Starks soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Creal soils have eluvial horizons more than 14 inches thick. Fitchville, Iva, Kendall, and Stronghurst soils do not have 2B and 2C horizons within either the series control section or within depths of 40 inches. Waynetown soils have a sandy substratum. Hatmaker and all the soils indicated above do not have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Canadaigua, Caneadea, Churchville, Derb, Rhinebeck and Wallington series are in closely related families. Canadaigua and Derb soils do not have argillic horizons. Caneadea, Churchville, and Rhinebeck soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Wallington soils have a fragipan."

Arkport, Colonie, Raynham and Williamson soils do not have fine-silty particle size control sections. Associated soils on glacial outwash terraces include Chenango, Pompton and Red Hook. The associated Fremont, Hornell, Orpark, Busti and Chautauqua soils are on adjacent till plains."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The Barcelona series has previously been mapped as a bedrock variant of Niagara and Churchville soils. CEC activity class assigned as superactive based on one pedon of data from Cornell Univ.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches (Ap and BEg horizon).\nb.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 29 inches (Bt horizon).\nc.  Aquic moisture regime - evidenced by redoximorphic features in the horizon below the Ap horizon, and ped faces with 2 chroma or less and mottles in the argillic horizon (Bt horizon).\nd.  Aeric subgroup - evidenced by more than 40 percent high chroma matrix in the zone from 15 to 30 inches (Bt and 2BC horizon).\nCEC activity class - Assigned as superactive based on pedon data from Cornell Univ.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
