Rock fragments, mainly channers or gravel, range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the surface layer and upper part of the subsoil, and from 15 to 50 percent in the lower part of the subsoil and substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BEg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BE or Eg horizon. The BE horizon has chroma of 3 through 5, and the Eg horizon has value of 5 or 6 and lacks patchy clay films. Texture is similar to the BEg horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is angular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is angular or subangular blocky, or platy. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline. A 2CB horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has color and texture similar to the 2BC horizon. It is massive or has plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2R or 3R horizon is horizontal bedded shale or siltstone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Niagara and Westboro (T) series are in the same family. Niagara soils do not have bedrock within 60 inches. Westboro (T) soils do not have bedrock between 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Aptakisic, Creal, Fitchville, Hatmaker, Iva, Kendall, Starks, Stronghurst, Waynetown, and Yeddo (T) series may be in the same family when they are classified to the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Aptakisic and Starks soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Creal soils have eluvial horizons more than 14 inches thick. Fitchville, Iva, Kendall, and Stronghurst soils do not have 2B and 2C horizons within either the series control section or within depths of 40 inches. Waynetown soils have a sandy substratum. Hatmaker and all the soils indicated above do not have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Canadaigua, Caneadea, Churchville, Derb, Rhinebeck and Wallington series are in closely related families. Canadaigua and Derb soils do not have argillic horizons. Caneadea, Churchville, and Rhinebeck soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Wallington soils have a fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barcelona soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in silty lacustrine sediments underlain with till having a high shale content. Bedrock, mainly shale and siltstone, occurs at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F., and the growing season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

Collamer and Niagara soils are fine-silty but do not have the underlying glacial till and bedrock within a depth of 60 inches. Arkport, Colonie, Raynham and Williamson soils do not have fine-silty particle size control sections. Associated soils on glacial outwash terraces include Chenango, Pompton and Red Hook. The associated Fremont, Hornell, Orpark, Busti and Chautauqua soils are on adjacent till plains."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Barcelona series has previously been mapped as a bedrock variant of Niagara and Churchville soils. CEC activity class assigned as superactive based on one pedon of data from Cornell Univ.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches (Ap and BEg horizon).\nb.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 29 inches (Bt horizon).\nc.  Aquic moisture regime - evidenced by redoximorphic features in the horizon below the Ap horizon, and ped faces with 2 chroma or less and mottles in the argillic horizon (Bt horizon).\nd.  Aeric subgroup - evidenced by more than 40 percent high chroma matrix in the zone from 15 to 30 inches (Bt and 2BC horizon).\nCEC activity class - Assigned as superactive based on pedon data from Cornell Univ.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
