    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees F. The soil between depths of 6 to 16 inches is usually dry all of the time from April 15 to November 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. The moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic. Some pedons may contain 5 to 10 percent cobble sized shale fragments. The soil is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nColor of the A horizon is 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/3, 5/4. Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 3/4. It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam. Shale fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are 2 mm to 100 mm in diameter.\nColors of the C horizon are similar to the A horizon. It is shaly clay or shaly clay loam. Shale fragments range from 15 to 35 percent and are 2 mm to 100 mm in diameter."
