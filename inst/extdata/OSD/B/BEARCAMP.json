  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearcamp series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Bearcamp soils are on broad ridgetops and north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 105 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
