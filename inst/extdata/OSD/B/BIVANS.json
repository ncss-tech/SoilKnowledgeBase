  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 50 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in all horizons except where the surface has been limed.  Nodules and fragments of ironstone and limestone, less than 5 percent by volume, are throughout the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  In some pedons, the E horizon has been mixed with the Ap horizon.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red range from few to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Btg horizon ranges from 35 to 59 percent.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Crowley, Paisley, and Wyick series in the same family.  The somewhat poorly drained Crowley Paisley soils have a more alkaline Btg horizons due to the influence of underlying carbonatic materials, lack ironstone nodules, and are west of the Mississippi River.  The somewhat poorly drained Wyick soils are moderately deep to a cemented pan and are largely confined to Texas."

Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches."

Blichton and Lochloosa, Wacahoota soils are arenic and have loamy subsoils.  In addition, Lochloosa soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Boardman soils have loamy argillic horizons and contain more than 5 percent nodules and fragments of ironstone and limestone.  Flemington soils have more clay in the subsoil.  Kanapaha soils are grossarenic and have loamy argillic horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained Micanopy soils have mixed mineralogy."

The natural vegetation consists of loblolly, longleaf, and slash pine, sweetgum, maple, hickory, magnolia, water oak, live oak, laurel oak, and holly.  The understory vegetation is dominated by waxmyrtle, blackberry, greenbrier, bluestems, panicums, low paspalum, threeawns, and dwarf huckleberry."
