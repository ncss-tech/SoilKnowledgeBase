  "OVERVIEW": "The Blinn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on escarpments and basalt plateaus. They formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 44 degrees F.",
