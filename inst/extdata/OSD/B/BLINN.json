  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are on basalt plateaus and escarpments. They formed in basalt colluvium and residuum with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations range from 2,100 to 3,200 feet. Slope is 5 to 65 percent but the soils occur mainly on less than 35 percent north-facing slopes. The climate is subhumid. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches, including 2 to 4 feet of snow. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."

Bobbitt and Lacy soils have a mesic soil temperature regime, occur on south slopes at lower elevations and have mollic epipedons. Dorb soils occur on north slopes at higher elevations and have a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Santa soils do not have bedrock above depth of 40 inches and have a fragipan."
