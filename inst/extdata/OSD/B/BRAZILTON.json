    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brazilton soils are on summits and shoulders of interfluves on uplands that have been created and/or altered by earth moving equipment. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent and are similar to the original landscape before coal was excavated from the surface mines. The soils are in excavated materials that have been replaced by major horizons. The original soils mainly had a silty surface layer and a clayey subsoil that developed from Pennsylvanian age geology. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 991 to 1194 mm (39 to 47 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 16 degrees C (54 to 61 degrees F). Elevation is 200 to 330 meters (655 to 1083 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index is greater than 64."
