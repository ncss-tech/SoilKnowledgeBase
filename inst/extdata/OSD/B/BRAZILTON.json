  "OVERVIEW": "The Brazilton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on interfluves and hillslopes. They formed in excavated material that has been replaced by major horizons.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",

Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent and are similar to the original landscape before coal was excavated from the surface mines. The soils are in excavated materials that have been replaced by major horizons. The original soils mainly had a silty surface layer and a clayey subsoil that developed from Pennsylvanian age geology. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 991 to 1194 mm (39 to 47 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 16 degrees C (54 to 61 degrees F). Elevation is 200 to 330 meters (655 to 1083 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index is greater than 64."
