  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Biaggi series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone or shale.  Biaggi soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil, between the depths of 6 and 19 inches, is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 and is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 in most years.  Organic carbon content in the upper cubic meter is 12 to 20 kg.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/3 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.   Gravel content is 0 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is 20 to 50 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid through slightly acid.  Organic carbon content ranges from 2 to 4 percent.  Some pedons have a thin Bw horizon above the lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Biaggi soils are on marine terraces.  They occur in areas along the front edge of terraces, along terrace shoulders, and in other areas where the underlying wavecut bedrock platform is closer to the soil surface.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 100 to 400 feet.  The soil formed in material weathered from sandstone or shale.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range in temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 48 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."

The Crispin soils, in a similar geographic setting, are underlain by a dense, gravelly pan at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The Cabrillo, Flumeville, Heeser, Mallopass and Windyhollow series are more than 60 inches deep and are on areas of the marine terraces that have received accumulations of sediment."
