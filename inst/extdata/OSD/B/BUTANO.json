  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Butano series consists of well drained, moderately permeable soils developed from weathered siliceous shales of the Monterey formation.  They occur on sloping to steep topography under coniferous forests.  Mean annual rainfall is 30 to 50 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Butano soils occur at elevations usually above 600 feet in a subhumid mesothermal climate having a mean annual rainfall of 30 to 50 inches with warm, dry but somewhat foggy summers and cool, wet winters; an average January temperature of about 50 degrees F; an average July temperature of about 57 degrees F; a  and a\nCharacteristically the Butano soils have thin medium acid, light brownish gray A1 horizons that grade into very strongly acid, brown B2 horizons.  The clay content gradually increases to the parent rock which is fractured in the upper portion.\nVariations are mainly in depth to bedrock and in color and texture of B2 horizon.  On steeper slopes, the B2 may be weak and only slightly more clayey than the A.  In slightly concave positions the depth to bedrock is greater than at the type location possibly due to some additions to the surface by colluvial deposition. Also the B2 tends to be of somewhat redder hue and slightly more clayey than on plane or convex slopes.  The proportion of shale fragments above the Cr is variable from place to place.  Loam and gravelly loam types have been recognized."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  They resemble the Hugo, Lobitos, Melbourne, Mendocino, and Santa Lucia soils.  All of these soils except the Santa Lucia developed on less siliceous rocks.  The Hugo soils lack textural B horizons and usually are underlain by relatively soft sandstone to considerable depths.  The Lobitos soils have thick dark A1 horizons and are slightly acid throughout.  The Melbourne soils contain many iron and manganese cemented pellets, have redder B2 horizons (7.5YR hues) and are about moderately fine to fine textured throughout.  The Mendocino soils have moderately developed (compact clay loam), reddish yellow B2 horizons overlying deeply weathered, soft sandstone.  The Santa Lucia soils are formed on similar rocks to the Butano but have gray A horizons, usually are shaley, and lack textural B horizons."
