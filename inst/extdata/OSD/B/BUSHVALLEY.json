Gnojek, and Tolman soils formed in parent material weathered from sandstone. Teaspoon soils formed in parent material weathered from gneiss. Tolbert soils formed in parent material weathered from granite. Gnojek and Owlrock soils have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation. Teaspoon soils are moist is all parts of the moisture control section for 60 or more consecutive days after July 15. Tolman soils a have an intermittent BA horizon; reaction ranges to moderately alkaline; allows a Btk horizon above sandstone with carbonaceous shale. Zibetod soils have less than 18 percent clay. Argirocker soils formed in limestone and have rock fragments of limestone gravel and cobble."

These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from pyroclastic materials such as breccia, tuff, ash, cinders or intermediate igneous rock.  Elevation ranges from 6,470 to 10,500 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 33 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  The frost-free period is 55 to 120 days."
