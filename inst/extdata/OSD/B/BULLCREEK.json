  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to visible salts ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The surface generally is dispersed and crusted.  Below the A horizon, the SAR ranges from 10 to 15 and EC ranges from 4 to 16.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 inch to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the B horizon.  The dark colors typically extend into the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay or silty clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It typically has accumulations of gypsum and other salts in the lower part.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Accumulations of gypsum crystals and other salts range from few to many."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bullcreek soils are on level to moderately sloping upland valleys, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Many areas have slight gilgai microrelief.  Slopes typically are less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  They formed in dense clayey alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches; and growing degree days are about 3000 to 3300."

Promise, Chantier, Opal and Sansarc soils are on adjacent higher uplands.  Chantier and Sansarc soils have bedded shale within a depth of 20 inches.  Opal soils have bedded shale within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Wendte soils have a fine-textured control section and are adjacent to larger drainageways below areas of Bullcreek soils."

Permeability is very slow, except after dry periods when initial intake may be rapid due to cracking of the surface.  Flooding is none or rare.  Some pedons have a seasonal water table at a depth of 4 to 6 feet."
