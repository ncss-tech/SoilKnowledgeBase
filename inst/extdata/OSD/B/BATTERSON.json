  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are underlain by a lithic contact at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Typically, they are calcareous throughout but may be leached for 1 or 2 inches in some pedons.  The weighted average organic carbon content of the surface 15 inches or the portion above the bedrock is approximately .4 percent.  The sand/clay ratio ranges from 7 to more than 15.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from less than 1 to 4 percent and the occurrence of visible secondary calcium carbonate is erratic.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 78 degrees F.  The control section is predominantly loamy sand or sand, but textures finer than loamy fine sand occur in the control section.  The content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Surface horizons having value as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist are too thin or lack sufficient organic matter to qualify as mollic epipedons.  The A1 horizon is mildly to moderately alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.4).  Typically, it has weak granular structure, but may have weak platy structure in the upper few inches.  It ranges from soft to loose.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6), and has 1 to 4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, with the accumulation of visible carbonate being erratic from place to place."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Batterson soils are on gently sloping to steeply sloping upland hills and ridges.  They formed in sandy, calcareous sediments weathered from underlying red bed sandstone.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 45 percent.  At the type location average annual precipitation is 13 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 63 degrees F."
