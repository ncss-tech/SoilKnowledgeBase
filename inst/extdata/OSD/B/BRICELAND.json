Elevations range from 155 to 460 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone. Landscapes dominated by Briceland soils have hummocky relief and slips. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influenceand cool, wetwinters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C.  Frost free period is about 240 to 280 days"
