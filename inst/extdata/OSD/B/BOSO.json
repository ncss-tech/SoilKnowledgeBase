  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boso series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone, dolostone and quartzite. The Boso soils are on summits and side slopes of fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
