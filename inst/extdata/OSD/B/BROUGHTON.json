  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar series in other families include Covington, Geeburg, Lucas, Paulding, Roselms, St. Clair, and Vergennes. The Covington, Paulding, and Roselms soils have redoximorphic features with dominant chroma of 2 or less in the matrix immediately below the surface horizon. In addition, Paulding soils do not have argillic horizons. Geeburg, Lucas, and St. Clair soils average less than 60 percent clay in the argillic horizon, and in addition, Lucas and St. Clair soils do not have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broughton soils are on dissected areas of lake plains. They are adjacent to drainageways and have short slopes, usually less than 150 feet. Slopes are usually convex with gradients of 2 to 35 percent. The soils formed in very fine textured lacustrine sediments. Evidence of weak lamination is in some pedons. Most areas are underlain by till but at a depth of more than 203 cm (80 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 175 to 244 meters (575 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Paulding and Roselms soils in a toposequence with Broughton soils and the Defiance and Wabasha soils. The very poorly drained Paulding soils are on broad level areas on lake plains. The somewhat poorly drained Roselms soils are on less sloping areas along drainageways or are on slightly elevated areas on lake plains. The somewhat poorly drained Defiance and poorly drained or very poorly drained Wabasha soils are on nearby flood plains. They do not have an argillic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Permeability is very slow."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Gently sloping areas of Broughton soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay are the principal crops. Sloping areas are used for small grain and pasture, and steep areas are used for pasture and woodland. Woodland consists of mixed hardwoods."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 15 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 15 to 46 cm (Bt1, Bt2).\nAquic conditions: iron depletions or matrix with chroma of 2 or less in all horizons below a depth of 30 cm (12 inches).\nThis pedon has aquic conditions at a depth of 30 cm (12 inches), and may have a seasonal high water table as high as 30 cm (12 inches). More study is needed to determine water table depth.\nAdditional work is needed to determine if silty clay or clay surface phases of Broughton should be in Aquertic subgroup. The previously correlated surface phases of silt loam or silty clay loam will need studied during update activities. It is likely that they will meet the criteria for an abrupt textural change and be reclassified into the Albaquic Hapludalfs.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for pedons DF-29 and PD-41.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
