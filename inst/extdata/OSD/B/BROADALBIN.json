  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 34 to 60 inches. The depth to the fragipan is from 18 to 36 inches. Rock fragments range from 1 to 35 percent by volume in the upper solum, 3 to 35 percent in the lower solum and from 10 to 50 percent in the C horizon. Some pedons have redoximorphic features 23 or more inches below the mineral surface. The soil is strongly acid to slightly acid in the mineral solum and strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E or 2E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from sandy loam to silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate platy or subangular blocky, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bx or 2Bx horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chromas of 2 through 4. It ranges from sandy loam to loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak or moderate platy or blocky structure. Consistence is firm and very firm.\nThe C, Cd, or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from sandy loam to loam. In some pedons the material is calcareous. It is massive with or without plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Bath, Braceville, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Rushford, Sodus, Swartswood, Wellsboro and Wurtsboro series are in the same family. Bath soils have rock fragments dominated by siltstone, sandstone, and shale. Braceville soils have stratified materials in the control section. Ira and Sodus soils are dominated by red or gray sandstone with variable components of limestone and shale. Lackawanna and Wellsboro soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the fragipan. Mardin soils have rock fragments dominated by siltstone, sandstone, and shale. Rushford soils are formed in a thin mantle of till underlain with silty lacustrine deposits. Swartswood and Wurtsboro soils are formed in till derived primarily from gray and brown quartzite, conglomerate, and sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broadalbin soils are nearly level to hilly soils of till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in 15 to 36 inches of eolian material over till dominantly from granites and gneisses that have been mixed with a small to moderate, but significant component of soft dark shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 46 degrees to 49 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation from 35 to 50 inches; and frost-free period ranges from 135 to 155 days."

Charlton soils lack a fragipan. Massena, Mosherville and Sun soils occupy the wetter parts of the drainage sequence."
