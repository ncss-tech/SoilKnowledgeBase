  "OVERVIEW": "The Broadalbin series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in an eolian mantle and the underlying till. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the upper part of the mineral soil is moderately high to high and is moderately low to moderately high in the fragipan and substratum. The mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Bath, Braceville, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Rushford, Sodus, Swartswood, Wellsboro and Wurtsboro series are in the same family. Bath soils have rock fragments dominated by siltstone, sandstone, and shale. Braceville soils have stratified materials in the control section. Ira and Sodus soils are dominated by red or gray sandstone with variable components of limestone and shale. Lackawanna and Wellsboro soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the fragipan. Mardin soils have rock fragments dominated by siltstone, sandstone, and shale. Rushford soils are formed in a thin mantle of till underlain with silty lacustrine deposits. Swartswood and Wurtsboro soils are formed in till derived primarily from gray and brown quartzite, conglomerate, and sandstone."
