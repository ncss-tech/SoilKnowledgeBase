    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic material is 16 to 51 inches thick.  Fibers are dominantly herbaceous and woody and fiber content ranges from 20 to 50 percent unrubbed and 10 percent or less when rubbed.  The organic material contains 15 percent or more wood fragments greater than 2 mm.\nThe Oa horizons have hues of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; values of 2 through 4; and chroma of 1 through 4.  Some pedons may contain as much as 10 inches of hemic material in the surface or subsurface tiers.  They are medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 through 4; and chroma of 0 through 4.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY.  It has value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bullwinkle soils are in nearly level bogs within glacial lake plains and till plains.  Slopes are plane to slightly convex with a gradient of less than 2 percent.  This soil formed in 16 to 51 inches of woody organic materials and are underlain by loamy calcareous glacial till or lacustrine sediments. These underlying materials are of the late Wisconinan glaciation period.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 28 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used primarily for timber production and occasionally for production of wild rice.  The native overstory vegetation is black spruce or tamarack in pure stands or in a mixture with northern white cedar.  The understory is comprised of various amounts of hypnum moss, sphagnum moss, leather leaf, labrador tea, bog birch, alder, and willow."
