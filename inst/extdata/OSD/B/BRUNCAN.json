  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bruncan soils are nearly level to rolling on tablelands, calderas, structural benches, plains and buttes at elevations of 825 to 1,795 meters.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in mixed silty alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 360 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 80 to 145 days."

Arbidge and Snowmore soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a duripan.  Hardtrigger soils lack an indurated duripan.  Laped soils have less organic matter in the surface horizon and are drier.  Minveno soils lack an argillic horizon.  Troughs soils have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon.  Arbidge, Buncelvoir, Hardtrigger and Snowmore soils are on lower sideslopes and toeslopes.  Laped, Minveno and Troughs soils are on similar landscape positions."

The remainder of the OSD has not been updated since 6/93.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - zone 0 to 8 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - zone 8 to 28 cm (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - zone 13 to 28 cm (Btk1, Btk2, and Bkq horizons).\nDuripan - zone 36 to 51 cm (Bkqm horizon).\nLithic contact- The boundary at 51 cm (R boundary).\nParticle-size control section - The zone  from the soil surface to 36 cm. (the A, Bt, Btk1, Btk2 and the Bkq horizons).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
