  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The combined thickness of the A1 and B2 horizons ranges from 24 to 32 inches. The average texture of the 10- to 40-inch control section is very cobbly very fine sandy loam or very cobbly fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent cobbles and gravel.  Cobble and loam with less than 18 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent cobbles and gravel. Cobble and gravel content generally increases with depth, ranging mainly from 20 to 70 percent in the A horizons and 50 to 80 percent in the B2 and C horizons. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at 20 inches depth is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section during the summer. The A1 horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It contains less than 1 percent organic matter. This horizon is very cobbly very fine sandy loam to very cobbly or very gravelly fine sandy loam or very cobbly or very gravelly light loam. It has weak, fine and medium subangular blocky structure. It is mildly alkaline to slightly acid.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is noncalcareous to slightly calcareous and slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Bradshaw soils are on slightly convex south-and west-facing, very steep mountain slopes at elevations o 6,000 to 8,000 feet. Slope gradients are 25 to 80 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and minor amounts of limestone. The climate is moist subhumid continental; the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches, falling mostly as snow. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches, falling mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 80 to 100 days."

Daybell soils have mean annual temperature of less than 59 degrees F. Gappmayer soils have albic horizons and very cobbly sandy clay loam argillic horizons. Harkers soils have gravelly clay argillic horizons. Henefer soils have cobbly clay argillic horizons. Wallsburg soils are less than 20 inches deep over bedrock and have very stony heavy clay loam argillic horizons."
