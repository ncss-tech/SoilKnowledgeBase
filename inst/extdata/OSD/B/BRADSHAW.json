  "OVERVIEW": "The Bradshaw series is a very deep, well drained soil formed in mixed colluvium.  Bradshaw soils occur on mountains, with slopes of 25 to 80 percent. Typically, the A horizon is dark grayish brown, very or extremely cobbly very fine sandy loam.  The B2 horizon is brown, extremely cobbly very fine sandy loam.  The C horizon is brown, extremely cobbly loam. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The combined thickness of the A1 and B2 horizons ranges from 24 to 32 inches. The average texture of the 10-to-40-inch control section is very or extremely cobbly very fine sandy loam, or very or extremely cobbly fine sandy loam, with less than 18 percent clay, and 50 to 80 percent cobbles and gravel.  Cobble and gravel content generally increases with depth, ranging mainly from 20 to 70 percent in the A horizons, and 50 to 80 percent in the B2 and C horizons. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at 20 inches depth is 60 to 65 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts, for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the moisture control section during the summer.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine earth material is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. The fine earth material is modified with coarse fragments; very or extremely cobbly, or very or extremely gravelly. It has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure. The soil matrix is noncalcareous. It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon. Texture of the fine earth material is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. The fine earth material is modified with coarse fragments; very or extremely cobbly, or very or extremely gravelly. The soil matrix is dominantly noncalcareous. A few rock fragments may have thin carbonate coatings, but were not enough to be recognized as significant secondary accumulations. It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine earth material is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. The fine earth material is modified with coarse fragments; very or extremely cobbly, or very or extremely gravelly. The soil matrix is noncalcareous to slightly calcareous.  A few rock fragments may have thin carbonate coatings.\nCarbonates if present, were not enough to be recognized as significant secondary accumulations. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Bradshaw soils are on slightly convex south-and west-facing, very steep mountain slopes at elevations of 6,000 to 8,000 feet. Slope gradients are 25 to 80 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and minor amounts of limestone. The climate is moist subhumid continental; the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches, falling mostly as snow. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 80 to 100 days."

Daybell soils have mean annual temperature of less than 59 degrees F. Gappmayer soils have albic horizons and very cobbly sandy clay loam argillic horizons. Harkers soils have gravelly clay argillic horizons. Henefer soils have cobbly clay argillic horizons. Wallsburg soils are less than 20 inches deep over bedrock and have very stony heavy clay loam argillic horizons."
