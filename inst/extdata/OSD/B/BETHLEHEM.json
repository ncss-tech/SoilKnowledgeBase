This move was required due to the mesic/thermic break established in MLRA 136. Alexander County is mesic. The November 2025 revision changed the format. No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon)\nArgillic and kandic horizon--The zone from 18 to 61 centimeters (7 to 24 inches) has low activity clay in more than 50 percent of the horizon (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact--Weathered bedrock at 84 centimeters (33 inches) the upper boundary of the Cr horizon)."
