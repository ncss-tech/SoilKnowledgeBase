  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick over a Cr horizon of weathered bedrock. Hard bedrock is deeper than 40 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed. Content of flakes of mica ranges from few to common in the A and upper B horizons, and from few to many in the lower B and C horizons. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 60 percent by volume in the A horizon, from 0 to 35 percent in the E, BA, BE, and Bt horizons, and from 15 to 60 percent in the BC and C horizons. Fragments are dominantly gravel or cobbles.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 3 to 6. Horizons with a value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick. Texture of the A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 6 or 8. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Subhorizons of the Bt range to 7.5YR in some pedons. Texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8. Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored loamy saprolite weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks such as sillimanite schist, phyllite schist, or mica schist.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered high-grade metamorphic rock such as sillimanite schist, phyllite schist, or mica schist that can be dug with difficulty with a spade."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bethlehem soils occur on ridgetops and side slopes in the upper part of the thermic Piedmont. They form in residuum weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks such as sillimanite schist, phyllite schist, and mica schist. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The July 2009 revision moves the type location from Alexander County, NC to Rutherford County, NC.  This move was required due to the mesic/thermic break established in MLRA 136.  Alexander County is mesic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 7 inches to a depth of 24 inches (Bt horizon).\nKandic horizon - The zone from 7 to 24 inches. This zone meets the requirements of the low activity clay amendment in more than one half the volume.\nParalithic contact - The contact at 33 inches with weathered bedrock (the upper boundary of the Cr horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nMLRA: 136\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0191 BETHLEHEM   2-45   58-63   180-230   40-60   700-1200\nNC0281 BETHLEHEM   2-45   58-63   180-230   40-60   700-1200\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0191 NONE          >6.0                 -     20-40   SOFT\nNC0281 NONE          >6.0                 -     20-40   SOFT\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                 3-Inch  No-10   Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0191  0-7   GR-SL GRV-SL GR-SCL     0-20    35-76    7-35    2-10\nNC0191  0-7   CB-SL                  15-30    45-80    7-20    2-7\nNC0191  7-24  C CL GR-C               0-10    60-100  35-60    7-12\nNC0191 24-33  GR-SCL GRV-SCL          0-20    30-85   20-35    4-8\nNC0191 33-60  WB                       -        -       -       -\nNC0281  0-7   SL L                    0-5     80-100   7-20    2-7\nNC0281  7-24  C CL GR-C               0-10    60-100  35-60    7-12\nNC0281 24-33  GR-SCL GRV-SCL          0-20    30-85   20-35    4-8\nNC0281 33-60  WB                       -        -       -       -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
