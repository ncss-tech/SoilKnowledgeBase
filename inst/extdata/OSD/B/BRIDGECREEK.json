    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 15 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It has 30 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 45 to 60 percent clay.  There is an increase in clay content of 15 percent or more (absolute) within a vertical distance of 1 inch at the upper boundary.\nIn some pedons there is a thin silty clay loam layer immediately above the paralithic contact."

The soils formed in residuum from tuffaceous material with influence from loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
