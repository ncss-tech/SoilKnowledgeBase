  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blewett series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess.  Blewett soils are on mountaInsides and ridgetops that generally have a southerly aspect.  Slopes range from 30 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 29 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from l0 to 20 inches.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The control section averages 35 to 80 percent coarse fragments and 5 to 20 percent soft sandstone fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 5 dry or moist.   Textures are very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baldknob, Chumstick, Fivebit, Franktown, Laycock, and Logdell series.  All of these soils except Fivebit lack a Bw horizon.  Fivebit soils contain more clay.  Franktown soils have a C horizon. Laycock soils have an AC horizon.  Logdell soils are underlain by fractured shale at a depth of 5 to l2 inches. Chumstick soils are 35 to 70 percent schist, gneiss and granitic rock fragments, and lack 5 to 20 percent soft sandstone fragments.  Baldknob soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and lack 5 to 20 percent soft sandstone fragments."

Blewett soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone mixed with volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F., average July temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 42 to 44 degrees F.  The average  annual precipitation is 22 to 40 inches. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 130 to l70 days."
