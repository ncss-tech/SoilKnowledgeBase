  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigtoe series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in very gravelly alluvium. These soils are on fan terraces and have slopes ranging from 3 to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
