  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellcanyon series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone.  These soils occur on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm and mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
