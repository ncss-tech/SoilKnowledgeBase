  "REVDATE": "10/2008",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Belmann series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments and in the underlying lacustrine sediments. These soils are on flats and swales on glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
