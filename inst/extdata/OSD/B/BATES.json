  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bates soils are on interfluves and hillslopes on plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone of Pennsylvanian age which commonly contains thin beds of silty or sandy shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F). Elevation is 145 to 415 meters (475 to 1365 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 64 to 80."

Collinsville and Coweta soils are typically steeper and are less than 51 cm (20 inches) to bedrock. Dennis and Eram soils are on similar topographic positions as Bates soils, but have a fine-textured argillic horizon."
