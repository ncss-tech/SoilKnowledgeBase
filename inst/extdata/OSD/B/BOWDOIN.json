  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowdoin series consists of very deep, well drained clayey soils that formed in alluvium and glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
