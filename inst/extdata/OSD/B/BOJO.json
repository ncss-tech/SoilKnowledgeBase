  "REVDATE": "10/2015",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bojo series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed metamorphic or extrusive igneous rocks.  Bojo soils are on summits, crests and sideslopes of mountains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
