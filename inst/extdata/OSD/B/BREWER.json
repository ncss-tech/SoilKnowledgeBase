  "OVERVIEW": "The Brewer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium material of Pleistocene age. Brewer soils are on flood plains subject to rare flooding in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in).",
