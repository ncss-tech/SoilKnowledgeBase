  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Content of gravel-sized fragments, dominantly quartz and ironstone pebbles, is less than 10 percent, by volume, in all horizons except the A and E horizons which may have as much as 35 percent, by volume.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.  Depth to the Bt horizon is commonly 50 to 70 inches but ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Redoximorphic features that indicate wetness occur at depths of between 30 and 72 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Thickness is less than 10 inches where value is 3.5 or less.  Texture is sand, fine sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or their gravelly analogs.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is the same as the A or Ap horizon.  The E horizon has 50 percent or more uncoated sand grains.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, and sandy loam.  Thickness is less than 12 inches.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored varying shades of brown, yellow, red, white and gray.  In some pedons, redox depletions are within the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  Texture of the Bt horizon is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic accumulations in varying shades of brown, yellow, red, white and gray range from common to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, and, below a depth of about 60 inches, it ranges to sandy clay.  Content of plinthite is less than 5 percent within a depth of 60 inches, but ranges up to 15 percent below that depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Albany, Eddings, and Wadley soils with the same activity class and Darco, Murad, Shankler, and Tehran series.  The somewhat poorly drained Albany soils are on lower positions.  Eddings soils have more kaolinite in the argillic horizons and are on lower positions.  Wadley soils are on similar positions but have a water table below 72 inches.  Darco soils are on similar positions but do not have redox features in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained Murad soils and are on lower positions.  Shankler and Tehran soils are on similar positions but have an E horizon dominated by coated sand grains and do not have any redox features within 72 inches of the surface."

Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Alaga, Lakeland, Lucy, and Troup soils are on adjacent higher elevations and do not have a water table within 6 feet.  In addition, Alaga and Lakeland soils are sandy throughout, Lucy soils are arenic, and Troup soils are kandic.  Bonifay, Bonneau, Foxworth, Fuquay, Norfolk, and Pocalla soils are on similar positions.  In addition, Bonifay soils are plinthic while Bonneau soils are arenic and have yellower subsoils and plinthite in the subsoil.  Foxworth soils are sandy throughout, but have a seasonal high water table within 40 inches of the surface in most years. Fuquay and Pocalla soils are arenic and have plinthite in the Bt horizons.  Norfolk soils have a Bt horizon within 20 inches of the surface.  Chipley and Ocilla soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly lower elevations.  In addition, Chipley soils are sandy throughout and Ocilla soils are arenic. Johnston, Pelham, Plummer, and Rains soils are on flood plains and in depressions.  In addition, Johnston soils are very poorly drained while Pelham, Plummer, and Rains soils are poorly drained."
