  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Burchert series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over weakly and moderately consolidated tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone, and weakly consolidated ash. These soils are on backslopes and shoulders of hills with dominantly east and southeast facing aspects. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
