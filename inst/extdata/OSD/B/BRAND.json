  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist and are saturated with water several months each year when not artificially drained.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  The soil is more than 60 inches deep.  The sola are 40 to 50 inches thick.  They are usually free from rock fragments but some pedons have 5 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles.  The soil reaction in the control section ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  Redox concentrations and/or depletions range from faint to prominent and chroma of 2 through 8.  Some pedons lack redox concentrations in the surface 6 or 8 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Soil reaction is moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay and averages 40 to 55 percent clay.\nThe C horizon or the BCt horizon below the depth of 40 inches commonly is clay with 60 to 75 percent clay but it is stratified fine and moderately fine in some pedons."

The soils formed in alluvium from mixed but dominantly sedimentary materials.  The climate is characterized by warm and dry summers and cool and moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The average January temperature is 39 degrees F., and the average July temperature is 66 to 69 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 235 days."
