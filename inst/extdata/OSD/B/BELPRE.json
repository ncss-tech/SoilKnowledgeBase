  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (mollic colors)--the zone from 2 to 21 cm (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 21 to 71 cm (Bt horizons)\nParalithic contact at 115 cm (top of Cr horizon)\nThere is no laboratory characterization data for the Belpre series, and CEC activity class was assigned based on similar soils.\nThis revision moves the typical pedon to an area where Belpre is correlated as a major component, and includes several editorial changes. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were revised to current (2020) standards.\nRecent study of map units correlated to this series has shown Belpre to be less extensive than reported at the time of the series establishment. Belpre typically occurs as a minor component in map units correlated with the Upshur and Peabody soils in the alternating low and high base red clay shale formations of the Dunkard and Monongahela Groups. The layer thickness and color requirements for the Mollic intergrade do not occur in a consistent pattern to warrant use as a major component in many of the areas where Belpre soils were originally mapped.  This revision reduces the series extent from about 6000 acres to about 4000 acres.\nPrevious revision dates: 01/2006-DRM; Rev. DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
