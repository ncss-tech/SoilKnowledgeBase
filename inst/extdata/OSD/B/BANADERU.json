  "STATES": "PB",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Banaderu series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplifted limestone plateaus.  They formed in sediments overlying coralline limestone.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 87 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Usually dry for 90 to 120 cumulative days.  Soil is usually moist from July through December.\nSoil temperature - 77 to 84 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F.  variation between summer and winter.\nMollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 9 inches.  Some pedons have A horizons as shallow as 4 inches, but the upper portion of the Bt horizon qualifies as a mollic epipedon.\nDepth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches.\nClay content - 40 to 60 percent in the argillic horizon.\nA horizon - Color:  N2/0, 5YR 2.5/1, 3/2, 3/3, 2.5YR 3/2, 10YR 3/2.  Mixed texture:  Clay loam or clay.\nStructure:  Granular or subangular blocky.\nRock fragments:  5 to 20 percent, about one-half as cobbles, with occasional stones.\nB horizon - Color:  Dominantly 10R 3/4 3/6, but ranges to 2.5YR 3/4 3/6.\nTexture:  Clay loam or clay.\nStructure:  Prismatic or subangular blocky.\nRock fragments:  0 to 10 percent, mostly as angular cobbles.\nOther features:  Coatings on ped faces and pores with colors different than the matrix are not present in all pedons.  Colors of coatings include matrix colors, and also 10YR 4/2, 5YR 4/6, 7.5YR 6/8."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Banaderu soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus that are often concave and tilted.  They formed in sediments, possibly volcanic ash, that overlie relatively pure, porous coralline limestone.  Slopes are dominantly 3 to 15 percent, but range from 3 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 328 to 820 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter.  Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 90 inches, most of which falls between June and November."
