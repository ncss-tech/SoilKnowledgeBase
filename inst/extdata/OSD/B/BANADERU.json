  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Usually dry for 90 to 120 cumulative days.  Soil is usually moist from July through December.\nSoil temperature - 77 to 84 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F.  variation between summer and winter.\nMollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 9 inches.  Some pedons have A horizons as shallow as 4 inches, but the upper portion of the Bt horizon qualifies as a mollic epipedon.\nDepth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches.\nClay content - 40 to 60 percent in the argillic horizon.\nA horizon - Color:  N2/0, 5YR 2.5/1, 3/2, 3/3, 2.5YR 3/2, 10YR 3/2.  Mixed texture:  Clay loam or clay.\nStructure:  Granular or subangular blocky.\nRock fragments:  5 to 20 percent, about one-half as cobbles, with occasional stones.\nB horizon - Color:  Dominantly 10R 3/4 3/6, but ranges to 2.5YR 3/4 3/6.\nTexture:  Clay loam or clay.\nStructure:  Prismatic or subangular blocky.\nRock fragments:  0 to 10 percent, mostly as angular cobbles.\nOther features:  Coatings on ped faces and pores with colors different than the matrix are not present in all pedons.  Colors of coatings include matrix colors, and also 10YR 4/2, 5YR 4/6, 7.5YR 6/8."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chinen, Luta, and Takpochao soils. The Chinen soils have B horizon hues of 5YR or yellower.  Luta soils have yellower hues in the B horizon and oxidic mineralogy.  Takpochao soils are clayey-skeletal, have B horizons with hues of 5YR or yellower, and lack an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Banaderu soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus that are often concave and tilted.  They formed in sediments, possibly volcanic ash, that overlie relatively pure, porous coralline limestone.  Slopes are dominantly 3 to 15 percent, but range from 3 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 328 to 820 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter.  Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 90 inches, most of which falls between June and November."

Takpochao soils do not have pockets of soil that extend below a depth of 20 inches, and have an intermittent B horizon with hues of 5YR or yellower."

If pedons with slightly thinner horizons are mixed to a depth of 7 inches, the color and organic-carbon content qualify as a mollic epipedon.\nArgillic horizon - from the top of the Bt horizon to the lithic contact.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU. S. A."
