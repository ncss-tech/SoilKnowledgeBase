The phosphate content in the solum is variable but is typically medium or high.\nThe Ap or A horizons, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma from 2 to 4.  Some pedons have Ap or A horizons less than 7 inches thick with a value of 3 after mixing.\nThe AB or BA horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bt horizons, have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Crider is the only competing series.  Crider soils formed in a loess mantle and the underlying residuum from limestone. The Sandview and Shelbyville soils are in related families. Sandview soils formed in a thin mantle of silty material and residuum weathered from limestone.  Shelbyville soils formed in loess and the underlying limestone residuum, and have a dark colored surface layer.  The limestone residuum of the Crider, Sandview, and Shelbyville soils are not phosphatic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bluegrass soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands. Slopes are commonly 0 to 12 percent, but range up to 20 percent. The underlying limestone is cavernous and some areas have karst topography. The upper 20 to 40 inches of the solum formed in silty material and the lower part formed in residuum weathered from phosphatic limestone.  The phosphatic limestone members include the Lexington and Cynthiana Limestone Formations of the Inner Bluegrass Physiographic Region. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ashton, Caleast, Donerail, Elk, Fairmount, Faywood, Loradale, Lowell, Maury, McAfee, and Nicholson series.  Ashton soils are located on low stream terraces and alluvial fans, have a dark colored surface layer, and have a solum thickness of 40 to 60 inches.  Caleast soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone interbedded with thin strata of calcareous shale and siltstone, have a dark colored surface layer, have an average of more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and have a solum thickness of 40 and 60 inches.  Donerail soils have a dark colored surface layer, are moderately well drained, have an average of more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and have hues of 10YR or yellower in the subsoil.  Elk soils are located on stream terraces, and are typically more acid.  Fairmount soils formed in limestone residuum interbedded with thin layers of calcareous shales, have a solum thickness and depth to bedrock from 10 to 20 inches, have a dark colored surface layer, have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and do not have argillic horizons.  Faywood soils have hues of 7.5YR yellower in the Bt horizon and are moderately deep.  Loradale soils formed in residuum or old alluvium from limestone and thin layers of calcareous shale, have a dark colored surface layer, and have hues of 10YR or yellower in the subsoil.  Lowell soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone interbedded with thin layers of shale, have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, have a solum thickness of 30 to 60 inches, and have hues of 7.5YR or yellower in the lower part of the subsoil.  Maury soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  McAfee soils have a solum thickness and depth to bedrock from 20 to 40 inches, have a dark colored surface layer, and have an average of more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for crops; such as burley tobacco, corn, small grains, alfalfa, and for pasture.  Bluegrass and white clover are the most common pasture plants.  Native vegetation was dominated by oaks, elm, ash, black walnut, black and honey locust, hackberry, black cherry, and Kentucky coffee tree.  Glades of native grasses and canes were reported by early settlers."
