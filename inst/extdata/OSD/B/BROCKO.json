  "OVERVIEW": "The Brocko series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian materials, alluvium and lake sediments.  These soils are on hills, stream terraces, alluvial fans and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
