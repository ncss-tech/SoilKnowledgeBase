  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. Rock fragments of porcelanite and hornfels channers range from 5 to 35 percent in the solum and from 15 to 70 percent in the C horizon. Reaction, unless limed, ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid throughout the soil. Kaolinite, illite and vermiculite are the dominant minerals of the clay fraction with detectable amounts of chlorite and interstratified clays.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Value of 2 and chroma of 1 are permitted in undisturbed pedons. Fine-earth texture is loam or silt loam.\nUndisturbed pedons have E horizons with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Fine earth texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Fine-earth textures are loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5B, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. Fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam, and clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Caribel, Fredericktown, Neshaminy, Penn and Weedmark are in the same family. Caribel series consists of very deep soils formed in material weathered from basalt. The Fredericktown soils formed in stratified outwash deposits, mainly of sandstone and shale with a large amount of igneous gravel with or without a thin loess mantle and are on treads and risers on stream terraces. Neshaminy, soils have bedrock at a depth of more than 5 feet and formed on diabase. Penn soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches and formed in materials weathered from noncalcareous reddish shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone normally of Triassic age. The Weedmark soils are moderately deep or deep to a lithic contact and formed in residuum from gneiss schist, granite and other similar bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brecknock soils are on nearly level to very steep convex slopes of upland hills and low ridges. They formed in residuum weathered from metamorphosed red shale and sandstone (porcelanite). Climate is humid and temperate with mean annual temperature of 50 to 55 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches; and the growing season ranges from 165 to 200 days."

Bucks and Montalto soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Croton and Watchung soils are poorly drained and are on lower landscape positions. Lehigh and Mount Lucus soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly lower landscape positions.  Joanna soils are formed in residuum from interbedded Triassic red sandstone and conglomerate containing quartz pebbles"
