Reaction of the A horizon, the Bt horizon, and the Btx horizon ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid, except in areas where the surface layer has been limed.  Reaction of the B't horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  The 2C horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The upper  20 inches of the Bt horizon has from 20 to 32 percent clay.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8 with mottles in shades of brown or gray, or the horizon is mottled in these colors.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B't horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6 with few to many mottles in shades of brown and gray, or it is mottled in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8 with few to many mottles in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red, or it is mottled in shades of these colors.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dulac, Gigger, Loring, and Providence series in the same family and the closely related Erno, Falkner, Grenada, Libuse, Muskogee, Siwell, and Tippah series.  Dulac soils have very strongly acid or strongly acid clayey lower Bt and C horizons.  Gigger and Providence soils have a loamy 2Bt horizon.  Loring soils have a silt loam C horizon.  Erno, Grenada, and Libuse soils are not clayey in the lower horizons.  Falkner, Muskogee, and Tippah soils, which do not have fragipan characteristics in the B horizon, have an acid clayey lower Bt horizon.  Siwell soils do not have fragipan characteristics, and the thickness of the silty mantel is 20 to 40 inches over underlying clayey materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Byram soils are in uplands of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area.  These soils formed in a loess mantle, more than 48 inches thick and the underlying alkaline clays.  Slopes are nearly level to moderately steep with the slope gradient mainly less than 8 percent but ranging to as much as 15 percent along narrow hillsides.  Mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches.   Mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Byram soils are moderately well  drained; runoff is medium to rapid; permeability above the fragipan is moderate, moderately slow in the fragipan and very slow in the clayey underlying material.  Water is perched above the fragipan at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 feet during wet seasons late in winter and early in spring."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of the Byram soils are in urban areas.  A small acreage is used for growing pasture, hay, soybeans, and cotton.  Small woodland lots are in cherrybark oak, white oak, post oak, southern red oak, hickory, sweetgum, shortleaf pine, and loblolly pine."
