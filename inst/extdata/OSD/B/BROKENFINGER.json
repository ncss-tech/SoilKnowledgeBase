Mean winter soil temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, in the soil moisture control section and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days following the summer solstice; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume. The andic soil material has an estimated bulk density of 0.50 to 0.80 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent and 15-bar water retention of 20 to 35 percent for air dried samples.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 10 to 20 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 5 or 6 dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam.  It has 2 to 12 percent organic matter."
