Reaction of the surface layer ranges from medium acid to neutral and the C horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Fragments of shale and sandstone range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the profile.\nThe Ad horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 3, 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is a loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is mottled in shades of red, brown, and gray.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is sometimes slightly weathered in the upper part."

Kanima soils have greater amounts of coarse fragments throughout the profile.  Cartersville soils are deeper and do not have fragments of an argilic horizion within the profile.  Emachaya, Lequire and Whitefield series have depth of reclaim material over shale that are greater than 10 inches."

These soils are formed in the premine soils of the Hector, Linker and Enders series.  They are mainly found on the cutslopes and highwall areas of the strip mine.  The average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 45 inches."

Cartersville soils are on less sloping areas near topsoil stockpile areas.  Lequire soils are on similar areas and have more reclaim material placed over the shale.  Emachaya and Whitefield soils are on areas that are less sloping and are deeper over shale material.  Kanima soils are on adjacent, nonreclaimed areas."
