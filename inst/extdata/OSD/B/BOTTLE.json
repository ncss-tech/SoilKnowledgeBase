  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bottle series consists of well to excessively drained soils formed in acid, coarse-textured materials weathered from sandstone bedrock.  Bottle soils are on gently sloping to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",

Textures coarser than loamy very fine sand are excluded from the above ranges.\nTexture in the lower part--loamy sand or sand, and is thick enough to dominate the control section so that on a weighted average basis the soil belongs in a sandy family.\nRock fragment content--0 to 35 percent, mainly 10 to 250 mm in diameter\nA majority of subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, although in some pedons subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur.\nE horizon\nHue--5 through 7.5YR\nValue--5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist\nChroma--1 through 6\nReaction--pH 4.5 to 5.5\nBw horizon\nHue--5Y through 5YR\nValue--5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist\nChroma--1 through 6\nClay content--4 to 18 percent\nSand content--52 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand\nTexture--sandy loam\nReaction--pH 4.5 to 5.5\nC horizon\nHue--5Y through 7.5YR\nReaction--pH 4.5 to 5.5"
