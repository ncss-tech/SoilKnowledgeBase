  "OVERVIEW": "The Bottle series consists of well to excessively drained soils formed in moderately thin acid coarse textured materials weathered from sandstone bedrock.  Bottle soils are on gently sloping to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.  Typically, Bottle soils have light gray very friable platy very strongly acid A2 horizons, light yellowish brown very strongly acid sandy loam B2 horizons, and very pale brown very strongly acid loamy fine sandy C horizons over hard sandstone at a depth of 26 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Very thin dark colored A1 horizons occur above the albic horizon in some pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 30 to 59 percent (NH4Ac).  Depth of the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 8 to 24 inches.  The cambic horizon and upper part of the control section are typically sandy loam, but clay ranges from 4 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 52 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Textures coarser than loamy very fine sand are excluded from the above ranges.  The lower part of the control section is loamy sand or sand and is thick enough to predominate the control section so that on a weighted average basis the soil belongs in a sandy family.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and these are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  A majority of subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, although in some pedons subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur.  These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section at some time in most years.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 5 through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is very strongly or strongly acid (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is strongly or very strongly acid (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."
