  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bigwash soils are on drainageways in mountains. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and minor amounts of quartzite. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,890 to 2,800 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid, cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm. These soils receive additional run-on moisture making it wetter than the precipitation zone would indicate. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
