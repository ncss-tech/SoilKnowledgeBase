These soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstic throughout the soil moisture control section.   Depth to rock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 3 through 6 dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry.  It is heavy silty clay loam or silty clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The lower part has similar colors as above with coarse fragments increasing with depth and averaging 15 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe C horizon, where present, is silty clay loam or clay loam.  Coarse fragments range from 20 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles."

Galiente soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and have a 20 percent absolute clay increase to the argillic horizon.  Melbourne soils commonly have 45 to 60 percent clay in the control section and are mottled in the lower part of the agrillic horizon. Munset soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock.  Sauvola soils  are mottled throughout the argillic horizon.  Spreckels soils are very gravelly in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and dry warm summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 66 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 235 days."

Atring and Vermisa soils are loamy-skeletal and lack an argillic horizon. Bellpine and Jory soils have less than 35 percent base saturation in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Also, Bellpine soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Oakland soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Rosehaven soils are fine-loamy and located on rounded ridgetops and side slopes of mountains and foothills.  Sutherlin soil have contrasting textures and are moderately well drained."
