  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beron series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on dissected relict stream terraces and fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium over lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from igneous rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation is 5,700 to 6,700 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the average freeze free season is 100 to 120 days.",
