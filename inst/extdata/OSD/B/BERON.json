These soils formed in alluvium over lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from igneous rocks. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 5,700 to 6,700 feet. Average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the average freeze free season is 100 to 120 days."
