These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks, mainly volcanic tuff with minor amounts of limestone and quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1.460 to 1,980 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 180 days."
