  "OVERVIEW": "The Bancy series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow to a duripan that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
