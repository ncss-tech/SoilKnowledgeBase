  "OVERVIEW": "The Blitzen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Blitzen soils are on south facing hill and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
