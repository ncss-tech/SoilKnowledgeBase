The clay content of the clayey portion of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.\nThe A horizon has color with hue of 10YR, value of 1 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Salinity is very slight or slight.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizons have color with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Calcium carbonate concretions range from few to common and are concentrated in the lower part near the contact with the 2B horizon in most pedons.  Salinity is very slight or slight.  Effervescence ranges from none to slight.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bg1 horizon has color with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Some pedons have gravelly strata made of mainly shell fragments.  Salinity ranges from slight to moderate.  Effervescence ranges from none to slight.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bg2, or 2C horizon where present, have color with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons are mottled in shades of gray and brown.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Some pedons have gravelly strata consisting of shell fragments.  Salinity is slight or moderate.  Effervescence ranges from none to slight.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

These soils are on the Gulf Coast Marsh (MLRA 151) of southeast Texas.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  The soil formed in clayey and sandy sediments of Holocene age.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 62 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 250 to 270.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 8 feet.  The Thornthwaite P-E index is 68 to 80."

Bancker and Creole soils are in adjacent marshes slightly lower in the landscape.  Barnett soils are slightly higher in the landscape.  Sabine soils are sandy throughout and are higher in the landscape.  Sabine soils are mapped in a complex with Baines soils."

Water fluctuates between 0.5 to 1.0 feet above the soil surface most of the year.  These soils have aquic conditions in all years.  They are frequently flooded by storm tides."
