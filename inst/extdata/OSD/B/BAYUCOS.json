  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section\naverages between 18 and 30 percent clay.  Texture is loam, clay\nloam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Strata of\nvery fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, silt, sandy clay loam, or\nsilty clay are in most pedons.  Colors are light gray (10YR 7/1,\n7/2; 2.5Y 7/2; 5Y 7/1, 7/2), gray (10YR 6/1, 5/1; 5Y 6/1, 5/1; N\n5/ , N 6/ ), dark gray (10YR 4/1; N 4/ ), light brownish gray\n(10YR 6/2; 2.5Y  6/2) pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2), light olive gray\n(5Y 6/2), light greenish gray (5GY 7/1; 5G 7/1), or greenish gray\n(5GY 6/1; 5G 6/1).  Brownish or pinkish mottles range from few to\ncommon in most pedons.  In places, the thin sandy strata are\nbrownish, pinkish, or olive in color.  The N value is less than\n.7.  Salinity, as expressed in mmhos/cm., ranges from 20 to 50."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bayucos soils are nearly level, occurring near sea level  on islands along the Texas Gulf Coast.  The soils are not covered\nby daily tides, but are frequently covered by high tides.  The\nsoil formed in saline loamy sediments of recent deposits.\nSediments have been reworked and sorted by wave action and by\nwind.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Annual precipitation\nranges from 30 to 45 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges\nfrom 70 degrees to 73 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges\nfrom 40 to 64."
