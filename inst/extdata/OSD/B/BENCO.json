  "OVERVIEW": "The Benco series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash material with a mixture of loess in the upper part.  Benco soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 50 degrees to 55 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 25 inches for 70 to 90 consecutive days. The control section contains more than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has a dry value of 4 or 5, and a chroma of 2 or 3. The structure is weak granular or blocky. It is cobbly silt loam; stony loam or gravelly loam.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is silt loam or loam and is less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser, 5 to 18 percent clay, more than 45 percent silt and has 40 to 60 percent coarse fragments. The structure is weak subangular blocky or weak prismatic.\nThe C horizon is loamy coarse sand or coarse sand with 35 to 90 percent rounded rock fragments dominated by pebble size fragments."

Garrison soils are dry 45 to 75 consecutive days in the moisture control section. Clint soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Kilburn soils have a sandy loam B horizon with less than 45 percent silt."
