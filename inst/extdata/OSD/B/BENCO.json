The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 50 degrees to 55 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 25 inches for 70 to 90 consecutive days. The control section contains more than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has a dry value of 4 or 5, and a chroma of 2 or 3. The structure is weak granular or blocky. It is cobbly silt loam; stony loam or gravelly loam.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is silt loam or loam and is less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser, 5 to 18 percent clay, more than 45 percent silt and has 40 to 60 percent coarse fragments. The structure is weak subangular blocky or weak prismatic.\nThe C horizon is loamy coarse sand or coarse sand with 35 to 90 percent rounded rock fragments dominated by pebble size fragments."

The soils formed in glacial outwash materials with a mixture of loess in the upper part. Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. Mean July temperature is 73 degrees F., mean January temperature is 32 degrees F., mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 110 to 160 days."
