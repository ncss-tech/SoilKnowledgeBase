  "OVERVIEW": "The Burnside series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in 30 to 61 centimeters (12 to 24 inches) of medium-textured alluvium and the underlying loamy-skeletal alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1168 millimeters (46 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).",
