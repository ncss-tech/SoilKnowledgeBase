  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barronett series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits. These soils are on stream terraces and glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
