  "REVDATE": "08/2001",
  "STATES": "KY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brassfield series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from interbedded calcareous siltstone, sandstone, shale, and limestone. These upland soils have slopes ranging from 6 to about 50 percent The average annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to rock is 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of solum is about 10 to 30 inches.  Texture throughout is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and the channery or gravelly analogues.  Limestone, siltstone, or sandstone fragments from 2 mm to 3 inches across range from 8 to 30 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  A1 horizons, where present, are 1 or 2 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Colors are mottled with varied colors patterns.  Some pedons are without dominant matrix color.  Low chroma colors, where present, are inherited from the parent rock.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5GY, 10GY, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 2 or less, with yellowish brown and light olive brown mottles."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sloping to steep upland areas ranging from about 6 to 50 percent, commonly 12 to 30 percent.  The regolith, commonly called marly shale, is the residuum or interbedded greenish gray limestones, calcareous siltstones, calcareous sandstone and shale. These rocks may be phosphatic.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 48 inches."

The natural growth now is chiefly red cedar, chestnut oak, and red bud, ash, honey and black locust, elm, wild rose, sweet clover and wild legumes, grasses, and sedges."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Brassfield soils occur, it is believed, where former Otway soils became severely eroded and lost the mollic epipedon and clayey upper cambic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 18 inches (Bw).\nParalithic contact - at 36 inches (Cr).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Madison County, Kentucky.  Sampled profiles S66Ky76-2 and S66Ky76-3, courtesy University of Kentucky, show 55 to 65 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the B2 horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
