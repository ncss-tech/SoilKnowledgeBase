The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 60 inches or more.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The particle-size control section has 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent coarse and very coarse sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe AB and BA horizons have value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is moderately acid to slightly acid.  Base saturation by sum is 30 to 50 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It is clay loam or loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  It is very strongly acid to strongly acid.  Base saturation by sun is 20 to 35 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 1200 to 3500 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F, the mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches, and the frost-free period is 100 to 170 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lettia, Sitkum, Steinmetz, Stinger and Zing soils.  Stinger soils are 20 to 40 inches deep and associated with Buckshot soils on more steeply sloping, less stable positions.  Lettia, Sitkum, Steinmetz, and Zing soils have a xeric moisture regime and are on adjacent south slopes.  In addition, Sitkum and Steinmetz soils are coarse-loamy and Zing soils are somewhat poorly drained."
