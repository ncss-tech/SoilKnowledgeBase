  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckshot series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitic rocks.  Buckshot soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 60 inches or more.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The particle-size control section has 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent coarse and very coarse sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe AB and BA horizons have value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is moderately acid to slightly acid.

Stinger soils are 20 to 40 inches deep and associated with Buckshot soils on more steeply sloping, less stable positions.  Lettia, Sitkum, Steinmetz, and Zing soils have a xeric moisture regime and are on adjacent south slopes.  In addition, Sitkum and Steinmetz soils are coarse-loamy and Zing soils are somewhat poorly drained."
