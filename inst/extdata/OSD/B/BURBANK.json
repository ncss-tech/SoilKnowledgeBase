    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., and are moist during the winter and spring.  The particle-size control section (10 to 40 inches) is coarse sand to loamy fine sand and averages 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments.  Dark colors are inherited from the basaltic parent materialand organic matter content is less than 1 percent throughout.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4 dry and 1 to 3 moist. Some pedons are cobbly or stony.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 60 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 4 to 7, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand with 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 5, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand and averages 45 to 90 percent coarse fragments."

Denio soils lack a Bk horizon and formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Doowak soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F and have rock fragments of mixed lithology.  Sheeprock soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F and are calcareous throughout.  Crunkvar, Skaha, and Ulymeyer soils lack a Bk horizon and are non effervescent throughout.  Wrango soils are effervescent in all parts except a 1 to 4 inch thick A horizon and formed in alluvium from mixed volcanic rocks."

The soils formed in basaltic gravelly and cobbly glacial outwash alluvial deposits mantled by a mixture of alluvium and eolian sand.  The climate is arid; summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The average January temperature is 30 degrees F.  The average July temperature is 76 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 200 days."
