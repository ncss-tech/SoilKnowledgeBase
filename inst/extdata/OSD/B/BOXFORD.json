  "OVERVIEW": "The Boxford series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey marine sediments.  These soils are nearly level and are on terraces.  Permeability is slow in the upper part of the B horizon and slow to very slow in the lower part of the B and in the C horizons.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",

The soil ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the upper part of the solum, unless limed, and from strongly acid through neutral in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.  In undisturbed areas, many pedons have an upper sequum, 6 to 12 inches thick, consisting of thin 0e, Oa, E and Bh horizons.  Some pedons have an E' and B' horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has moderate very fine to medium granular structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y.  The upper part has value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular, or weak or moderate, very fine to medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.  The lower part of the B horizon has value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It has weak or moderate, medium to very coarse prisms parting to weak or moderate, medium to very coarse subangular blocky or angular blocky structure.  Most pedons have patchy to continuous coatings on prism faces with hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Continuous coatings are below depths of 20 inches. Coatings range from thin to thick and are mostly fine silt.  Most pedons have few to many oxide stains on ped faces in the lower parts of the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Structure is weak thin to thick platy with plates arranged in very coarse prisms, weak thin to thick platy, or the horizon is massive."
