  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Gravel content throughout the soil is less than 5 percent by volume. The soil ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the upper part of the solum, unless limed, and from strongly acid through neutral in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.  In undisturbed areas, many pedons have an upper sequum, 6 to 12 inches thick, consisting of thin 0e, Oa, E and Bh horizons.  Some pedons have an E' and B' horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has moderate very fine to medium granular structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y.  The upper part has value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular, or weak or moderate, very fine to medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.  The lower part of the B horizon has value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It has weak or moderate, medium to very coarse prisms parting to weak or moderate, medium to very coarse subangular blocky or angular blocky structure.  Most pedons have patchy to continuous coatings on prism faces with hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Continuous coatings are below depths of 20 inches. Coatings range from thin to thick and are mostly fine silt.  Most pedons have few to many oxide stains on ped faces in the lower parts of the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Structure is weak thin to thick platy with plates arranged in very coarse prisms, weak thin to thick platy, or the horizon is massive."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.\nThe Brancroft, Buxton, Minoa, Munson, and Suffield series are in related families.  The Brancroft and Minoa soils have less than 35 percent clay. Buxton soils are frigid.\nThe Munson soils have a coarse-silty over clayey particle-size control section.  Suffield soils do not have redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the surface and have a coarse-silty over clayey particle size particle size control section."
