    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils that occur in the same MLRAs are the Billett and Desker series. Billett soils average less than 10 percent coarse sand plus very coarse sand in the lower part of the series control section. Desker soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. These soils have a superactive cation-exchange activity class."
