  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Bourne series are very deep and moderately well drained. They formed in stratified marine and fluvial deposits. Permeability is slow to very slow in the fragipan. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is above 59 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 inches to 70 inches. Depth to fragipan commonly is 18 to 35 inches. Rounded pebbles of quartz up to 15 percent by volume occur throughout the solum in some pedons. Reaction commonly is strongly to extremely acid unless limed. In some pedons, there is a lithologic discontinuity below the fragipan.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 2 through 4. The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. The A horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon has colors similar to the Bt horizons and is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Some Bt horizons have mottles with chroma of 3 or more. The Bt horizons typically are loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and range to silt loam and silty clay loam. Silt content is more than 20 percent.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 8. In some pedons it is mottled. The lower part of the Bx horizon often is multicolored and has hues ranging from 2.5YR to 5Y. Textures of the Bx horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Bx horizon and ranges from loamy sand to clay. In some pedons, there is plinthic- like material.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red. Textures range from clay to loamy sand, plus gravelly analogues. Some pedons contain up to 50 percent pebbles in the C horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The York series is in the same family and the Beltsville, Cane, Locust, Ora, Prentiss, Savannah and Vaucluse series are in closely related families. York soils have coarse fragments of angular quartz and schist in the solum. Beltsville soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F. Cane, Ora, Savannah and Vaucluse soils have siliceous mineralogy; in addition, Ora soils have Bt horizons in hues of 2.5YR or 5YR. Locust and Prentiss soils lack Bt horizons above the fragipan."
