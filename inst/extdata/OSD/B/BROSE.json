  "OVERVIEW": "The Brose series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow soils that formed from colluvium and residuum from welded tuff.  They are on summits.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
