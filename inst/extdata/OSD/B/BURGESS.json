  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.  The soil is 80 to 90 percent base saturated. These soils have lower volume change on wetting and drying than do other soils having similar sand/clay ratios and have very hard semi-cemented consistence when air dry in the horizon or low organic matter content. Packing patterns of sand grains within the soil fabric tend to be cubical or rhomboidal.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent and are predominantly fine and very fine angular granite pebbles. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 45 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 48 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is soft or slightly hard and neutral to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has coarse subangular blocky structure but in some pedons it has weak prismatic structure. This horizon is typically gravelly sandy loam, but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 35 percent, and sand from 55 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser and with a high proportion of the sand fraction being medium and coarse angular granitic sand. It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4;  It is loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid."

The Bassel, Scriver, Spinney, Tiagos and Washpass series are very deep.  The Ethelman and Opitz series have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  The Greenman series has slightly alkaline through slightly acid reactions in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Burgess soils are on moderately to steeply sloping mountain slopes, upland hills and ridges. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent or more. The soils formed in moderately or slightly acid parent sediments weathered from underlying granite bedrock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 24 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer. The average annual temperature is 36 degrees F. Frost free season ranges from 40 to 80 days."
