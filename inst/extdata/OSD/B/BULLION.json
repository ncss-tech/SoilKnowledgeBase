The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

They are intermixed with the Bullion soils.  Magna soils have an aquic moisture regime,  mollic epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur in depressions below Bullion soils.  Woodrow soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth, do not have a natric horizon and are fine-silty.  They occur in broad drainageways on alluvial plains."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 inches (A horizon).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 6 to 14 inches (Btn horizon).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 14 to 60 inches (Bky, Cky1, Cky2, and Cky3 horizons).\nVertic feature - The zone from the soil surface to 40 inches with linear extensibility of 6 cm or more.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 6 to 14 inches (Btn horizon).\nThis revision of November 2003 updates the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Natrargids based on the ninth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2003.  The classification was previously changed in 1994 from Fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Xerollic Natrargids to Vertic Natrargids.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Two pedons sampled as Bullion in Davis County, Utah have characterization data from the Riverside, CA Soil Survey Laboratory as soil survey sample numbers S73UT-011-001 (pedon # 73C0080) and S73UT-011-002 (pedon # 73C0081).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
