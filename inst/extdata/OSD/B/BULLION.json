  "OVERVIEW": "The Bullion series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Bullion soils are on alluvial flats and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The classification was previously changed in 1994 from Fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Xerollic Natrargids to Vertic Natrargids.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Two pedons sampled as Bullion in Davis County, Utah have characterization data from the Riverside, CA Soil Survey Laboratory as soil survey sample numbers S73UT-011-001 (pedon # 73C0080) and S73UT-011-002 (pedon # 73C0081).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
