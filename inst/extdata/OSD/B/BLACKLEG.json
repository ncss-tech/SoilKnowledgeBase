  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackleg series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Blackleg soils are on outwash and fan terraces with slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the average annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
