    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blackleg soils are on escarpments of tablelands and summits, backslopes, and footslopes of outwash and fan terraces.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,170 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluviums derived from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 300 to 430 mm.  Average annual temperature is 3 to 7 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 50 to 95 days."
