  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Badrock soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, or rhyolitic tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,286 to 2,720 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 356 to 406 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
