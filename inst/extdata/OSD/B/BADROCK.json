  "OVERVIEW": "The Badrock series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolitic or andesitic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Badrock soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, or rhyolitic tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,286 to 2,720 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 356 to 406 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
