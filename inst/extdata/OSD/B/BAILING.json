  "OVERVIEW": "The Bailing series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium. Bailing soils are in concave positions on basalt plains and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
