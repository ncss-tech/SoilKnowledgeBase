    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to saprolite ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard consolidated chert bedrock ranges from 20 to 35 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 35 to 70 percent, by volume.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of paragravels and paracobbles range from 35 to 70 percent, by volume.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same colors and textures as the Bw horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is saprolite composed of basalt, chert or rhyolite.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of unconsolidated basalt, chert, or rhyolite bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bermeja soils are on side slopes and summits of hills and mountains on the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium that weathered from basalt, chert and rhyolite.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 78 to 82 degrees F."

Cerro Mariquita (T) soils are on similar positions, but have clayey subsoils that weathered from volcanic bedrock.  Llanos Costa (T) soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and have clayey-skeletal subsoils.  Maguayo soils are on lower positions, are deep to bedrock, and have clayey subsoils."

The classification was updated with the 06/2002 draft from Loamy, mixed, active, isohyperthermic, shallow Aridic Haplustepts to Loamy, mixed, active, isohyperthermic, shallow Typic Haplocambids.  A soil moisture study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognizes the Aridic Soil Moisture Regime in southern Puerto Rico.\nBermeja soils formed in the Mariquita Chert Formation (KJm).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Cabo Rojo Municipality, Puerto Rico; S02PR-079-002R.
