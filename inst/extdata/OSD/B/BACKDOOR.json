Ballard soils have gravel from siliceous shale rather than paragravel from granite.  Bohna soils are 40 to 73 inches deep to a paralithic contact and lack gravel and paragravel.  Boontling soils have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in the A horizon, and low chroma mottles in the lower Bt horizon.  Chualar soils have a gravelly C horizon, but no paragravel.  Chuloak soils have less than 15 percent gravel throughout and have mottles in the C horizon.  Feethill soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to weathered rock.  Franciscan, Gilroy and Tajea soils are  20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Pinole soils have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent throughout, and variegated colors and manganese stains in the lower Bt horizon.  Pinto soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments throughout and have sandy clay loam or clay loam C horizons with black manganses stains.  Shimmon and Soper soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Tehachapi soils have a weakly cemented, moderately alkaline C horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Backdoor soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from granite.  Elevation is 984 to 2,789 feet (300 to 850 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches (432 to 483 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 to 63 degrees F (15 to 17 degrees C).  The frost free season is 190 to 210 days."
