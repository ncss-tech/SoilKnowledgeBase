    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bozarth soils are on remnant dunes on glacial outwash plains along the west coast of Whidbey Island. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in eolian sands underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are 0 to 70 meters. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. The average annual precipitation is about 457 to 635 mm. The average annual temperature is about 10 to 11 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the upper part (A, E, and Bg horizons) and moderately low in the lower part (Cd horizon). Bozarth soils may have a perched water table as high as 25 cm in December through February. At lower slope ranges, Bozarth soils are subject to occasional ponding for very brief durations from December to March."

This series had an inactive status in the Soil Series Classification database before 4/2006. 7/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting; no major technical changes were made.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
