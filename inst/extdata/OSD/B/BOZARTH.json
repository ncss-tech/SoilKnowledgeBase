  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bozarth series consists of moderately deep to a densic contact, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in eolian sands underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Bozarth soils are on remnant dunes on glacial outwash plains at elevations of 45 to 80 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 559 mm.  The average annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

This series had an inactive status in the Soil Series Classification database before 4/2006. 7/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting; no major technical changes were made.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
