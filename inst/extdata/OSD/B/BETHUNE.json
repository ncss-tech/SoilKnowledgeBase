  "OVERVIEW": "The Bethune series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on plains. They formed in loess over weakly cemented calcareous sandstone from the Ogallala Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",
