    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSolum thickness ranges from 50 to 75 inches, depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches, and seasonal high water table ranges from 48 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments of gravels, cobbles, stones and channers make up 15 to 45 percent in the surface and in the subsoil, but averages less then 35 percent  in the partical size control section, and 15 to 50 percent in the substratum.  The soil is strongly or very strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4, chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 6 through 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons have weak medium platy structure in spots.  This pedon exhibited fragic characteristics in places but not expressed strong enough to classify as a fragipan to meet current standards.\nThe BC horizon is similar in color and texture to the Bt horizon.  The C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nRock is variegated with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 10YR, and 2.5Y; there seems to be a high iron content in the rock and is very hard."

The soils developed in colluvial material derived from light-gray to medium-gray quartzite, conglomerate, and meta-graywacke.  The lower foot slopes have a sandy phyllitic shale and siltstone components.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F. and annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 50 inches."
