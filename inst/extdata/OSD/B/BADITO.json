  "OVERVIEW": "The Badito series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from conglomerate and sandstone.  These soils are on warm south-facing mountainsides.  Slopes range from 25 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",
