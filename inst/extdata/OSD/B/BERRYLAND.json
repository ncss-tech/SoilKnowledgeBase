Unless drained, the water table is at depths of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) in summer months.\nDepth to the Spodic Horizon: 25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches)\nRock Fragments: less than 15 percent, by volume throughout the profile, mostly quartzose pebbles, commonly less than 5 percent. The Bh horizon contains firm nodules that range from non-cemented to strongly cemented and are hard to very hard when dry.\nSoil Reaction: Extremely acid to strongly acid, throughout the profile, unless limed\nOther Features: Iron content is low in most pedons and specimens from the Bh horizon do not normally turn red when heated unless the soils are limed.\nRange of Individual Horizons:\nO horizon (if it occurs):\nColor--hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 to 3\nType of organic soil material--highly decomposed to slightly decomposed plant material\nA, Ag, or Ap horizon:\nColor--hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3\nTexture--coarse sand, sand, fine sand,  loamy fine sand or loamy sand, with mucky modifiers\nEg horizon:\nColor--hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 5 or 6\nTexture--coarse sand, sand, fine sand, or loamy sand\nBh horizon:\nColor--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 1 to 4\nTexture--loamy sand or sand\nBg horizon:\nColor--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 to 3, or is neutral with value of 4 to 6\nTexture--loamy sand or sand\nRedoximorphic Features--iron depletions in shades of olive, gray, or white and iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive. Some pedons have one or more Bh horizons below the Bg horizon. This feature is not series criteria. These Bh horizons have the same range in color, structure, and rupture resistance as previously described.\nCg horizon:\nColor--hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, chroma of 1 to 2\nTexture--sand or loamy sand and below a depth of 40 inches is commonly stratified with finer textured material\nC horizon (if it occurs):\nColor--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 3 to 6\nTexture--sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand\nRedoximorphic Features--iron depletions in shades of olive, gray, or white and iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, yellow or olive\nAb horizon (if it occurs):\nColor--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of  2 to 4, chroma of 1 to 4\nTexture--sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam"

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:\nMajor uses--Mostly in woodland. Some of the soil has been cleared for growing high-bush blueberries and cranberries. Drained areas have been used for growing vegetables, corn, soybeans and small grain\nWhere wooded--predominantly pitch pine, widely spaced Atlantic white cedar, red maple, and black gum. The dense understory is commonly high-bush blueberry, sweet pepperbush, bay magnolia, leather leaf, gallberry, and greenbriar. In Maryland, loblolly pine, pond pine, red maple, sweetgum, black gum, willow oak, swamp chestnut oak, and American holly are important forest trees."
