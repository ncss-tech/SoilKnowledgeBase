  "OVERVIEW": "The Bradfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and alluvium derived mostly from shale.  Bradfield soils are on mesas and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
