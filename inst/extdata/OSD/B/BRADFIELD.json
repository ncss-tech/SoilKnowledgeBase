Cracks are 1/2 to 1 inch wide, 20 inches or more deep, and 12 inches or more long.  At a 20 inch depth the cracks remain open for 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years, though at the surface they may be open for shorter periods. The COLE value is about 0.07 in the surface layer and .06 in the Bss horizons.  Pressure faces and slickensides are evident in the particle-size control section.  Wedge shaped aggregates are present in most pedons.\nParticle-size control section:\nClay content:  35 to 60 percent\nSilt content:  10 to 45 percent\nSand content:  10 to 45 percent\nPararock fragment content:  0 to 10 percent parachanners (shale chips)\nA horizon:\nHue:  10YR or 2.5Y\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma:  1 to 3, dry and moist\nReaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline\nBss1 and Bss2 horizons:\nHue:  10YR or 2.5Y\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma:  1 to 3, and moist\nTexture:  C or CL\nParachanner content:  0 to 10 percent\nReaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline\nBss3 horizon:\nHue:  10YR or 2.5Y\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma:  3 or 4, dry and moist\nTexture: C or CL\nParachanner content:  0 to 10 percent\nReaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline\nCy horizon:\nHue:  10YR or 2.5Y\nGypsum:  0 to 5 percent\nReaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline"
