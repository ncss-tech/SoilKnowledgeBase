  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blomford series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed a sandy glacial outwash or eolian mantle and underlying calcareous, loamy till.  These soils are on moraines, lake washed till plains and glacial beach ridges.  They have rapid permeability in the upper mantle and moderate to moderately slow permeability in the underlying till.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to over 60 inches.  The upper mantle is 20 to less than 40 inches thick.  Rock fragments, by volume, range from 0 to 10 percent gravel in the upper part and 2 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the underlying till. A gravelly lag line up to 5 inches thick may occur at the contact of the upper mantle and the till.  Rock fragments range to 35 percent, by volume, in this horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy coarse.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Eg or E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Thin lamellae may occur in this horizon.\nSome pedons have a thin B/E, 2B/E, E & Bt, or 2E/B horizon.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.   The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  It has 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 45 percent total sand.\nSome pedons have a 2Bkg horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  Carbonate threads or masses are common to many.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nProperties of the 2BCg are similar to the B and C horizons respectively.  The reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The moist bulk density is 1.4 to 1.6 g/cc. Redox features with chroma of 1 to 4 are present."
