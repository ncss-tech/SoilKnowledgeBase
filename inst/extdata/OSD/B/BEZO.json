  "OVERVIEW": "The Bezo series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks.  Bezo soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
