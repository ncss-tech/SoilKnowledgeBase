There are 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments in profile.\nThe A horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma is 2 or 3 or moist.  Structure is weak medium or fine granular.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma is 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Structure is weak or moderate medium or fine subangular blocky.  Texture is clay loam, heavy loam or sandy clay loam. Reaction is mildly alkaline or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone mixed with loess in the upper part.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual January temperature is about 25 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season at 32 degrees F is about 130 days to 165 days."
