  "OVERVIEW": "The Borland series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone mixed with loess in the surface.  Borland soils are on valley uplands to elevations of1,000 to 3,800 feet.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma is 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Structure is weak or moderate medium or fine subangular blocky.  Texture is clay loam, heavy loam or sandy clay loam. Reaction is mildly alkaline or neutral."

The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual January temperature is about 25 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season at 32 degrees F is about 130 days to 165 days."
