  "OVERVIEW": "The Bobert series consists of very deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Bobert soils are on lake terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
