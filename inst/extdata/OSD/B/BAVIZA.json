  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Baviza soils occur on Holocene-age terraces on fan remnants and fan skirts. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in sandy alluvium or eolian sediments derived from igneous rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the annual total. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.  Elevation is 1,800 to 4,000 feet."
