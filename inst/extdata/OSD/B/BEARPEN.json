  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Prior to 1995, Bearpen soils were mapped with the Curran series in Pepin County and other SSAs in Wisconsin.\nThe mollic epipedon is considered to be the result of deposition of dark sediments rather than the result of prairie grasses.  These soils developed under woodland vegetation prior to the post-settlement deposition.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon  - 0 to 46 centimeters (Ap, A); argillic horizon - 46 to 127 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2g, 2Bt3); aquic feature - aquic conditions directly below the mollic epipedon in a horizon 15 centimeters or more thick that has value moist of 4 or more and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less. 1/19/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0587\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
