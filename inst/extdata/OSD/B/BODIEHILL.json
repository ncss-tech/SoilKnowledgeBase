  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bodiehill soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite and tuff-breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,100 to 3,025 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
