The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 40 to 85 percent total angular rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 20 to 30 percent gravel, 15 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 25 to 50 percent gravel, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid."

Freezeout soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Goodwin soils have a paralithic bedrock contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches over granitic rock types. Nanny soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section and are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  Snowbrier soils are slightly acid to strongly acid in the upper 10 to 20 inches of the solum and have hue dominated by 2.5Y and 5Y in the cambic horizon.  Undusk soils have an umbric epipedon 15 to 20 inches thick, are dominated by ash in the upper 4 to 6 inches of the A horizon, and are greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Brandypeak soils are on metastable broad ridgetops and active north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.   Elevations are 3,000 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
