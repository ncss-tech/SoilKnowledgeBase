  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10 to 40 inch control section is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Stratification varies from scarcely evident to pronounced.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  When moist, value is 3 and chroma is 2 or 3, the A horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  Thin layers may occur below a depth of 10 inches with a color darker than the allowable range of the surface layer.  The A horizon is usually fine sandy loam or loam, but is sandy clay loam or clay loam in a few pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizons have a hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Thin strata of very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or dark brown also occur in the control section.  The C3 and C4 horizons also include gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), and light gray (10YR 7/1).  The C horizons range from moderately acid in the upper part through moderately alkaline and calcareous in the lower part.  Interbedded strata of noncalcareous and calcareous materials are common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Bosque, Clairemont, Colorado, Congaree, Gowen, Loire, Pulaski, Spur, Uhland, and Yahola series. Bosque, Gowen, and Spur soils have mollic epipedons.  Clairemont, Colorado, and Yahola soils are calcareous.  In addition, Clairemont soils have fine-silty control sections and Yahola soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Congaree soils occur in a more moist climate and are strongly acid in some part of the 10 to 40 inch conrol section.  Loire soils are calcareous and have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 72 degrees F.  Pulaski and Uhland soils have less than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bunyan soils are on nearly level flood plains of small streams.  The soil floods rarely to commonly for brief periods during the spring and fall months.  The soil formed in loamy stratified alluvium of mixed origin.  The location of probable occurrence has a range of mean annual temperature of 64 degrees to 70 degrees F., average annual precipitation of 28 to 40 inches and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices of 40 to 64. Frost free days range from 200 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1300 feet."
