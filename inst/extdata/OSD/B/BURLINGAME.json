Texture ranges from silt loam to coarse sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe CA or AC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 2.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Rock fragments range from 0 to 40 percent.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR or is neutral, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from silt loam to sand.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series is named for Burlingame State Park located in Charlestown, Rhode Island.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface\n2. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)\n3. Particle size control section - 25 to 100 cm (CA, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, and Cg5 horizons)\n4. Aeric feature- 48 percent of the zone from 18 to 35 cm has hue of 2.5Y and both color value moist of 4 and chroma moist of 3 (CA horizon).\n5. Nonacid reaction class - the zone from 48 to 100 cm. has a pH in water, 1:1of about 5.5 or more.\nAdditional Data: Reference sample for the typical pedon is 2011RI007001, by the University of Rhode Island, 2011. Additional reference samples include 2011RI009003, 2011RI009029, 2011RI009042, 2011RI007007, and 2011RI009056, by the University of Rhode Island, 2011.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
