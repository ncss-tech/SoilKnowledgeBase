  "OVERVIEW": "The Burlingame series consists of subaqueous soils that are permanently submerged in 0 to about 3 meters of water on lakeshores of freshwater ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. The soils formed in mixed lacustrine material overlying till. They are typically underlain by supraglacial meltout or lodgement till. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters.",

Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface\n2. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)\n3. Particle size control section - 25 to 100 cm (CA, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, and Cg5 horizons)\n4. Aeric feature- 48 percent of the zone from 18 to 35 cm has hue of 2.5Y and both color value moist of 4 and chroma moist of 3 (CA horizon).\n5. Nonacid reaction class - the zone from 48 to 100 cm. has a pH in water, 1:1of about 5.5 or more.\nAdditional Data: Reference sample for the typical pedon is 2011RI007001, by the University of Rhode Island, 2011.
