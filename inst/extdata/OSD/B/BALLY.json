    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches and the depth of the soil is more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 63 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 to 29 inches is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 15, and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30.  Soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout. Coarse and very coarse sand is more than 15 percent throughout.  Base saturation varies from 75 to 95 percent throughout.  Variegated colors from weathered rock fragments are in the lower argillic and C horizons in many pedons.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3, or 3/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 3/2, or 2/2.  Where moist color values are 3 or 2, the A1 horizon is less than 4 inches thick.  It is sandy clay loam or loam with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Organic carbon varies from 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 7/8, 5/4 or 4/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 3/4.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam, clay or sandy clay and ranges from 25 to 55 percent clay content.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe 2C horizon dry color is 10YR 5/4; 7.5YR 7/8, 6/4, or 5/4. Moist colors are 10YR 4/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 4/4.  It is sandy clay loam and clay loam with 50 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Clay content typically varies from 20 to 30 percent."
