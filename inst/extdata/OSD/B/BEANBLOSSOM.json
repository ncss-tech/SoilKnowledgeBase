Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 millimeters (40 to 46 inches) and mean annual temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F).

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Beanblossom soils were included with the Burnside soils in the past, and correlated as nonacid family taxadjuncts. The CEC activity class is estimated based on soils formed in similar parent materials.  The series type location was moved in 2001 to a more representative area of how the soils have been correlated throughout the MLRA. Redoximorphic depletions may or may not be identifiable at 107 centimeters (3.5 feet) or below.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (Ap horizon); 2) Cambic horizon: the zone from 13 to 61 centimeters (5 to 24 inches) (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); and 3) Paralithic contact at 137 centimeters (54 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA; Data for this pedon (S81IN13-5) is published in Station Bulletin No.494, Dept. of Agronomy, Agriculture Experiment Station, Purdue University.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
