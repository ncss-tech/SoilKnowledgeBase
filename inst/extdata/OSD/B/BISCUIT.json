  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Biscuit series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy lacustrine sediments over calcareous clayey materials on lake plains.  Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy part and very slow in the clayey material.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Reaction of the upper loamy material is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It occurs as pockets or discontinuous layers in the Ap horizon in some pedons.  The A and E horizons are very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sand.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sand.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Textures are the same as for the Bs horizons.  Some pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR and chroma of 4 to 6.  The E part has colors similar to the E' horizon. The B/E horizon is very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and value of 4 or 5.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and value of 4 or 5.  It is clay or silty clay with thin stratified bands of silt and silt loam.  The thin bands have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons do not have stratified bands.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification was adjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 7 Sept 94 by CLG.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches (Ap horizon); albic horizon - the zone from 10 to 11 inches and from 16 to 19 inches (E and E' horizons); spodic horizon - the zone from 11 to 16 inches (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 31 inches (2Bt horizon).  For laboratory data on representative pedon, refer to Michigan Technological University pedon number 85MI-033-1.\nBased upon the current problems with the chemical requirements for spodosols, the classification of the series was changed from Sideraquods to Haplaquods.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
