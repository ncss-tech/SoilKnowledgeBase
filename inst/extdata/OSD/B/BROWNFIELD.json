  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownfield series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils derived from sandy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Brownfield soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm (18 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn. Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077CY035TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C."
