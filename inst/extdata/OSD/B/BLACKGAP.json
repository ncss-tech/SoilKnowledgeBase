Similar soils include Ector (TX), Langtry (TX), Lozier (TX), and Mariscal (TX) series.\nIceberg soils have less than 18 percent clay content in the control section.  In addition Iceberg soils receive significant winter precipitation, and are intermittently moist in the soil moisture control section during winter and spring, typical of the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30).\nEctor and Langtry soils have a mollic epipedon.\nMariscal soils do not have a calcic horizon, and contain channers and flagstones.\nLozier soils have a thermic soil temperature regime."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Blackgap soils were formerly included in the Lozier series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (1 to 5 in); (A horizon)\nBecause the epipedon has calcium carbonate equivalent greater than 40% and color value of 5 or less, it meets the color requirements for mollic epipedon.  However, the soil does not meet the moisture requirement for a mollic epipedon because it is moist in some part of the epipedon for less than 90 days (cumulative) in normal years during times when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm (20 in) is 5 degrees C (41 degrees F).\nCalcic horizon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); (A and Ak horizons); secondary calcium carbonate accumulations on fragments and in fractures\nLithic contact: 28 cm (11 in); upper boundary of R layer\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU Soil Characterization Laboratory data are available for the typical pedon, S90TX043-003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
