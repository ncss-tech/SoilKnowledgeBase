  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and tertiary sediments.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways and giant ripple marks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
