  "OVERVIEW": "The Brockway series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty loess, lake sediments and alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
