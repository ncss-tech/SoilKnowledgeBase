  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Boston soils are on nearly level to steep areas of the loess-capped dissected Illinoian till plain. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. These soils formed in a mantle of loess and the underlying till over residuum from Silurian limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 940 to 1170 mm (37 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 9 to 14 degrees C (48 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 155 to 225 days. Elevation is 274 to 351 meters (900 to 1150 feet) above mean sea level."

Bratton soils do not have a fragipan or a layer of till above the residuum and occur in a complex with Boston soils in places. Cincinnati and Rossmoyne soils are not underlain by bedrock and are on similar positions. Grayford soils do not have a fragipan and are on similar positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between January and April in years with normal precipitation. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/sec) in and below the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow (0.01 to 0.2 inches/hour) in and below the fragipan."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Much of the area of Boston soils are used for general farming. Cultivated crops are mainly corn, wheat, soybeans, grass and legumes, and tobacco. Some areas are used for pasture or woodland, and a small portion is idle. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwoods including beech, white and red oaks, maple, hickory, and tulip poplar."
