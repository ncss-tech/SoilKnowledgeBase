  "OVERVIEW": "The Bogue series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in residuum of weathered acid fissile shale.  These gently sloping to steep soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 22 inches.",
