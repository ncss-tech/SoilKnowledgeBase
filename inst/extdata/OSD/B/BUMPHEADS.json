  "OVERVIEW": "The Bumpheads series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt or tuff.  Bumpheads soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
