Nuffer soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and are calcareous in all parts to the soil surface. Blackotter and Nuffer soils are on floodplains and low terraces in positions along the rivers below Bearbou soils. Hades soils are on alluvial fans and terraces along the sides and above Bearbou soils."
