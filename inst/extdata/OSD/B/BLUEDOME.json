The soils formed in alluvium dominantly from limestone. The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer.  The average summer air temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is 35 to 43 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  Frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
