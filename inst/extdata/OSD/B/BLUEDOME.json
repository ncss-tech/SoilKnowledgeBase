  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluedome series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Bluedome soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  Permeability is moderate above the duripan. and very rapid below the pan.  The average annual precipitation is about l0 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
