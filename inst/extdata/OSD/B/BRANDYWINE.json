  "BYREV": "Rev. WDC",
  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "MD,NC,PA,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brandywine series consists of very deep somewhat excessively drained or excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in material weathered from gneiss.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 30 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is 5 to 10 feet.  Gneiss and vein quartzite coarse fragments, mostly gravel size range from 0 to 15 percent in the surface, 5 to 50 percent in the subsoil and 40 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  Cobble size stones range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum andfrom0 to 50 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragment content is greater than 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Stones occupy .1 to 3 percent of the surface in some pedons.  The soil is strongly acid to extremely acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Value of 3 is confined to undisturbed A horizons less than 3 inches thick.  It is loam, gravelly loam or cobbly loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, gravelly loam or cobbly loam. The BC or B/C horizon has similar colors. Texture ranges from coarse sand to loamy sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 8 and commonly are variegated.  Low chromas are inherent and not due to wetness. Texture ranges from coarse sand to loamy sand in the fine earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Gloucester and Hoosic series are members of the same family.  Gloucester soils have stones or boulders throughout and have erratics.  The Hoosic soils have water-sorted gravel throughout the control section and are stratified in the lower part of the series control section.\nThe Alton, Berks, Bremo, Calvin, Cardiff, Chenango, Coeburn, Dekalb, Elliber, Lehew, Manlius, Mt. Airy, Occoquan, Oqsuaga, Parker, Steinsburg, Stumptown, Teas and Tunkhannock series are similar soils in related families.  All of these series have textures averaging finer than loamy fine sand within the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brandywine soils are nearly level to steep soils on side slopes and elevated ridges in northern portions of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent and are generally more than 15 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from gneiss and related Cambrian and Precambrian rocks.  The climate is temperate and humid, with a mean annual temperature of 45 to 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation of about 40 inches."
