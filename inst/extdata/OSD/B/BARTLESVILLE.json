  "STATES": "KS,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bartlesville series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. Bartlesville soils are on crests and side slopes of cuestas and hillslopes, in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 in).",
