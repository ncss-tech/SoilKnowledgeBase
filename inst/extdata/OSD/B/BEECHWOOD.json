  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beechwood series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in modified loamy eolian deposits and in the underlying sandy or loamy glacial till on drumloid ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 51 inches.  The loamy eolian mantle ranges from 24 to 51 inches thick.  The control section averages between 6 and 16 percent clay and between 30 and 70 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the E and Bw horizons and from 5 to 20 percent in the 2Bw and 2C horizons.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the E and Bw horizons and from 5 to 15 percent in the 2Bw and 2C horizons.  The rock fragment content averages from 0 to 10 percent in the E and Bw horizons and from 10 to 35 percent in the 2Bw and 2C horizons. The silt loam mantle is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  The underlying till ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 4 and has weak or moderate, fine or very fine granular structure.  The O horizons consist mostly of hardwood, conifer and herbaceous material, contain many fine to coarse roots and are extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are dominantly silt loam, but the range includes loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The 2Bw3 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The Bw horizons are silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.  Some pedons have strata or pockets of sand or loam."
