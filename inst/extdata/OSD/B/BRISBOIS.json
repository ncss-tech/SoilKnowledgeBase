  "OVERVIEW": "The Brisbois series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in basaltic colluvium and loess over clayey sediments underlain by weathered tuff.  Brisbois soils are hillslopes.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 4 to 10 inches.  Depth to an argillic horizon is 1 to 4 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent stones, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Paragravels range from 0 to 20 percent and paracobbles from 0 to 15 percent.  Carbonates occurs as coatings on rock fragments or as masses."

Bedzee soils are shallow to a paralithic contact of shale and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Chalco soils are shallow to weathered tuff and lacks secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon.  Espint soils lacks secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon, are moist 10 to 20 days during the summer, and have a soil temperature of 53 to 59 degrees F.  Gumble soils are 14 to 20 inches to fractured, soft tuff and have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the sand-size fraction of the control section.  Xman soils are shallow to weathered andesite and have hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
