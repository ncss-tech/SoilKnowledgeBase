The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 4 to 10 inches.  Depth to an argillic horizon is 1 to 4 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent stones, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Paragravels range from 0 to 20 percent and paracobbles from 0 to 15 percent.  Carbonates occurs as coatings on rock fragments or as masses."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Bedzee soils are shallow to a paralithic contact of shale and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Chalco soils are shallow to weathered tuff and lacks secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon.  Espint soils lacks secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon, are moist 10 to 20 days during the summer, and have a soil temperature of 53 to 59 degrees F.  Gumble soils are 14 to 20 inches to fractured, soft tuff and have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the sand-size fraction of the control section.  Xman soils are shallow to weathered andesite and have hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brisbois soils are on hillslopes.  This soil formed in weathered John Day volcanic tuff overlain by clayey sediments.  A mantle of basaltic colluvium and loess was added later.  Slope is 2 to 90 percent.  Elevation is 2,000 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F."

Cant soils are clayey-skeletal, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on south facing slopes.  Drinkwater soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep to bedrock, and are on colluvial footslopes and fans.  Gooserock soils are loamy-skeletal, have Vitrandic properties in the soil surface, are very deep to bedrock, and are on north slopes.  Meadowridge soils are fine-loamy, very deep to bedrock, and are on benches.  Monroe soils are fine-loamy, very deep to bedrock, and are on flood plains and very gentle alluvial fans."
