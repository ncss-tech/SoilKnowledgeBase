  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent, and apparent field estimated clay of 8 to 15 percent and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The lower part is 5 to 15 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments by weighted average.  Depth to densic material is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It contains 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam and contains 15 to 25 percent pebbles, 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Cd horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam and contains 20 to 40 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Moist bulk density is 1.70 to 2.00 g/cc with an RV of 1.85 g/cc."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barnellcreek soils are on footslopes and toeslopes of glaciated mountains.  These soils formed in glacial till, mainly of granitic origin, with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 3,200 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Louploup, Mineral, and Nevine soils are all well drained.  In addition, Louploup and Nevine soils lack a mollic epipedon.   Mineral soils are loamy-skeletal and moderately deep to a lithic contact."
