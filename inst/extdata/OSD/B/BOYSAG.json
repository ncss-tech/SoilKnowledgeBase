  "OVERVIEW": "The Boysag series consists of shallow, well drained soils on plateaus and mesas.  These soils formed in alluvium and eolian deposits from calcareous sandstone and limestone.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
