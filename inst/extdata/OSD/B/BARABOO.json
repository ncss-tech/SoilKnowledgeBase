  "OVERVIEW": "The Baraboo series consists of moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to a lithic contact with quartzite. These soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess over hard, quartzite bedrock. These soils are on high structural benches, ridgetops, and convex side slopes on uplands in the Baraboo Range. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
