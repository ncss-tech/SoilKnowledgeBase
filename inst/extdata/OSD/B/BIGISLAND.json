  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigisland series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of sandy-skeletal alluvium over dense, loamy till. These soils are on risers on stream terraces in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 15 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Due to further excavation the location of the typical pedon for the series was moved 150 feet west on 9-7-06.  The pedon at this location has not been described at this time (9-7-06) but is similar to the pedon described in this description.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006."
