Due to further excavation the location of the typical pedon for the series was moved 150 feet west on 9-7-06.  The pedon at this location has not been described at this time (9-7-06) but is similar to the pedon described in this description.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska-user pedonid 02WI013043 (http://ssldata.sc.egov.usda.gov/).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
