Gotchell, Crosgrain, Greyeagle and Longjim soils do not have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches. Tumarion and Marsite soils are moist for less than 20 cumulative days during July-September. Cline soils do not have secondary carbonate accumulations or a strongly alkaline reactivity class, and are over basalt. Nonamelake soils are inactive."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bylas soils are on dissected relict lakebeds of Pliocene and Pleistocene age. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and residuum from lacustrine limestone and sandstone which were influenced by silicate-rich deposits from nearby volcanoes. Elevations range from 2,500 to 3,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September, and gentle rains during December and January. May and June are the driest months.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 190 to 250 days."
