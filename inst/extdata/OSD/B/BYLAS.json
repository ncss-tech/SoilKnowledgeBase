  "OVERVIEW": "The Bylas series consists of very shallow and shallow well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from silicate-rich lacustrine limestone of Pliocene and Pleistocene age. Bylas soils are on dissected relict lakebeds and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

These soils formed in alluvium and residuum from lacustrine limestone and sandstone which were influenced by silicate-rich deposits from nearby volcanoes. Elevations range from 2,500 to 3,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September, and gentle rains during December and January. May and June are the driest months.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 190 to 250 days."
