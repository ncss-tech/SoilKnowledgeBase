  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness is 18 to 40 inches.  The soil is strongly acid to neutral in the solum and extremely acid to strongly acid in the substrata.  Depth to mottling and a seasonal high water table ranges from 18 to 42 inches.  Depth to stratified substrata is typically greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is loam, sandy loam or loamy sand with weak or moderate, and fine through coarse granular structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand in the lower part.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky.  The lower part of the B horizon has common or many, medium or coarse, high and low chroma mottles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 1 through 7.  Stratified textures are gravelly sand through sandy clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent pebbles."
