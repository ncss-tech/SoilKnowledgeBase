The soils formed in lacustrine deposits and the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1170 mm (37 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 14 degrees C (48 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 155 to 225 days. Elevation is 271 to 311 meters (890 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

Clermont soils have a lighter colored surface layer and an eluvial horizon. Secondcreek soils are very poorly drained, have a mollic epipedon, and are in depressionial areas at the base of the Cuba Moraine. Jonesboro and Rossmoyne soils are moderately well drained and are on convex areas. Nicely soils are moderately well drained and are on shoulders. Schaffer and Westboro soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly convex areas."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the upper part and low in the lower part. Permeability is slow in the upper part and slow or very slow in the lower part."
