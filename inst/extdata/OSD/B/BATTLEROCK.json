  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Battlerock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium derived from mixed sources. Battlerock soils are on alluvial terraces, drainageways, flood plains, and fans. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F (12.2 degrees C).",
