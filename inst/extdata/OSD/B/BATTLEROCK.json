The Binton and Boysen soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout. Clayhole soils have hues redder than 10YR and contain high amounts of gypsum. Hamburn soils overlap the Battlerock soils and should be revaluated during the updates. Jocity soils have hue of 5YR or redder. Lostwells soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle size control section. Toddler soils have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the control section. Youngston soils receive about 1/2 of their annual precipitation from April to June."

Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,850 to 5,700 feet (1,478 to 1737 meters). The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F (11.1 to 13.3 degrees C) and the mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 mm). the precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and May and June being the driest months. The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."
