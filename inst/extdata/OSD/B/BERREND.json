  "OVERVIEW": "The Berrend series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium and eolian sediments derived from conglomerate and volcanic sources. Berrend soils occur on piedmont slopes and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

These soils formed in loamy alluvium and eolian sediments derived mostly from conglomerate and volcanic sources. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during thunderstorms from June to September. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the annual total. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days."
