  "BYREV": "Rev. RJK-SRS-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "10/2012",
  "STATES": "IL,IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Backbone series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in moderately coarse or coarse textured eolian material, with or without a thin layer of residuum overlying limestone bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 centimeters. Backbone soils are on convex ridges and back slopes on uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",
