    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more\nthan 80 inches.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish\nbrown through dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4), or dark\nbrown (7.5YR 4/3, 4/4).  Mottles of very dark grayish brown (10YR\n3/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), dark brown (7.5YR 4/4), or strong\nbrown (7.5YR 5/6) are in some pedons.  It is sandy clay loam or\nclay loam and is very strongly through slightly acid.  The\nboundary is clear or gradual.\nThe B21t horizon is red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8), yellowish red (5YR 5/6,\n5/8), or reddish brown (5YR 4/4).  In most pedons this horizon has\nmottles of gray (10YR 6/1; 5Y 6/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4),\ngrayish brown (2.5Y 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), brown\n(10YR 5/3), or dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2).  It contains 45 to\n60 percent clay and is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe B22t horizon is similar in clay content and is gray (10YR 5/1,\n6/1; 5Y 5/1, 6/1), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), mottled with\nred (2.5YR 4/6,  4/8) very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2), dark\ngrayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/6).  It is\nmedium acid throuh neutral.\nThe B3ca horizon is light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4, 5/6), brownish\nyellow (10YR 6/6), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6, 6/8), light brownish\ngray (10YR 6/4), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1; 5Y 6/1), olive brown (2.5Y\n4/4), pale olive (5Y 6/4), or olive (5Y 5/3).  It is mottled in\nshades of red, gray, olive, and brown and is clay or shaly clay.\nIt is mildly or moderately alkaline and calcareous and contains\nfew to common soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate.\nThe Cca horizon is light olive brown, gray, olive brown, pale\nyellow, or olive and is mottled in shades of red, gray, olive, or\nbrown.  It is clay or shaly clay and contains few or common soft\nbodies and hard concretions of calcium carbonate."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Annona, Axtell, Boswell, Colbert,\nCrockett, Gore, Kipling, Normangee, Oktibbeha, Sacul, Susquehanna,\nWilcox, and Woodtell series.  Annona and Woodtell soils have an\nabrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons, and in\naddition, Woodtell soils are very strongly through slightly acid\nthroughout, including the C horizons.  Axtell, Crockett, and\nNormangee soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer\nperiods of time.  In addition, Axtell and Crockett soils have an\nabrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizon.  Boswell,\nSusquehanna, and Wilcox soils lack a zone of carbonate\naccumulation in any part of the Bt horizon within a depth of 80\ninches.  Colbert and Oktibbeha soils have over 60 percent clay in\nthe control section.  In addition, Oktibbeha soils have no gray\ncolors in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  Gore soils have\nmixed mineralogy.  Kipling soils are somewhat poorly drained and\nlack soft powdery lime in the lower solum.  Sacul soils have base\nsaturation of less than 35 percent."
