Elevations are 400 to 1,500 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210 to 300 days.  Burnthill soils are on the Griggs geomorphic surface."
