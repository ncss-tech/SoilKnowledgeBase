The soil is saturated with water at some period of the year.  Sandy or sandy-skeletal material is at depths of 20 to 40 inches.\nThe upper part of the particle-size control section is silt loam or silty clay loam and has thin layers of loam or sandy loam.  It has 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Distinct redox concentrations are at a depth of 6 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It is slightly to non-efferevescent in the upper most layer and non-efferevescent in lower layers.\nThe 3C or 4C horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry in the upper part and 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry in the lower part.  The chroma is 1 to 3.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.  It has 0 to 5 percent clay."

Powder soils are well drained, are coarse-silty, and lack strongly contrasting layers."
