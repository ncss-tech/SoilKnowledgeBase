  "OVERVIEW": "The Barbercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed on alluvial fans and fan remnants of alluvial plains. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 millimeters. The mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
