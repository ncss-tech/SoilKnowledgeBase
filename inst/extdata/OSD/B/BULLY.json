  "OVERVIEW": "The Bully series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in recent alluvium of mixed materials high in weathered diatomite. Bully soils are on flood plains and fans and are nearly level. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 48 degrees to 54 degrees F. These soils are usually dry and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Sand- and pebble-size chunks of diatomite are scattered throughout the profile but average less than 5 percent. The soils are moderately alkaline throughout and are noncalcareous.\nThe A and C horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. Silica-cemented rounded nodular concretions up to 1/2 inch in diameter are in the C horizon in amounts of 2 to 10 percent.  The A and C horizons are silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam and contain less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.\nStratified layers of coarse material from diatomaceous earth are below depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons."

The soils formed in recent alluvium of mixed materials high in weathered diatomite.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 to 9 inches with hot dry summers and cold dry winters. The average July temperature is about 68 degrees to 73 degrees F. and the average January temperature is about 24 degrees to 28 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees to 52 degrees F. and the frost-free period is about 120 to 150 days."
