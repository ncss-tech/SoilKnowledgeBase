  "OVERVIEW": "The Bacobi series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Bacobi soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 1 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
