  "OVERVIEW": "The Bridgewell series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. Bridgewell soils are on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
