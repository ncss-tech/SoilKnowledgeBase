  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  When moist values and chromas are less\nthan 3.5, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  It is silty\nclay loam, silt loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Btk1 and Btk2 horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 4 through 6.  The Btk1 has hue of 10YR\nin some pedons.  The Bt horizon is silt loam, clay loam, silty\nclay loam with the content of silicate clay estimated to range\nfrom 18 to 35 percent and it contains 1 to 10 percent sand\ncoarser than very fine sand.  Carbonate clays range from 3 to 15 percent.  The Btk1 horizon contains about 5 to 30 percent\ncarbonates and the carbonates increase to about 25 to 50 percent\nin the Btk2 horizon.  The calcic horizon begins near the top of\nthe Bt horizon with the maximum visible calcium carbonate begins\nat depths of 13 to 24 inches, with visible calcium carbonate\noccuring as concretions, soft bodies and films and threads.\nThe Btk3 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7,\nand chroma of 6 through 8.  Carbonates are concentrated on\nvertical faces of peds and range from 5 to 30 percent."

Angelo and Mansker soils\nhave mollic epipedons.  Midessa, Reagan, and Veal soils lack Bt horizons.  Posey and Tulia soils contain more than 15 percent\nsand coarser than very fine sand in the control section, in\naddition, Tulia soils contain more than 40 percent calcium\ncarbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Broome soils are on nearly level and gently sloping convex surfaces, mainly on broad lower side slopes of\nvalleys or side slopes of draws, intermittent streams or playas.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils have developed in calcareous loamy sediments presumed to be alluvial and eolian in origin and were recalcified by atmospheric dust.  The climate is\ndry subhumid to semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges\nfrom 17 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to\n70 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 25 to 31."

Ector soils are carbonatic, and Mereta and Rioconcho soils have more than 35\npercent silicate clay in their control sections."
