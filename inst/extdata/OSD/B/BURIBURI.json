  "OVERVIEW": "The Buriburi series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived dominantly from hard sandstone.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
