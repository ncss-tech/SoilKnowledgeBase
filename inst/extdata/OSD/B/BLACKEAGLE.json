These soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum from gneissic and/or granitoid rocks. Elevations range from 340 to 1215 meters (1,510 to 3,985 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (63 to 73 degrees F), and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Aguilareal soils are found on cooler, adjacent backslopes and have a thermic temperature regime. Carrizo soils are very deep, have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are in drainageways. Goldenbell soils are on summits of nearby fan remnants and have a diagnostic argillic horizon above a duripan. Jadestorm soils are on similar landscape positions, do not have a diagnostic cambic horizon and are shallow and very shallow to a paralithic contact. Rainbowend soils are on nearby fan remnants and have a duripan. Supplymine soils are on adjacent backslopes and have a calcic horizon above a moderately deep lithic contact."
