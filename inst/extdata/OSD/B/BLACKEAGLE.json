  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackeagle series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum from gneissic and/or granitoid rocks. The Blackeagle soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

Aguilareal soils are found on cooler, adjacent backslopes and have a thermic temperature regime. Carrizo soils are very deep, have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are in drainageways. Goldenbell soils are on summits of nearby fan remnants and have a diagnostic argillic horizon above a duripan. Jadestorm soils are on similar landscape positions, do not have a diagnostic cambic horizon and are shallow and very shallow to a paralithic contact. Rainbowend soils are on nearby fan remnants and have a duripan. Supplymine soils are on adjacent backslopes and have a calcic horizon above a moderately deep lithic contact."
