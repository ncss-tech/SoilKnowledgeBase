  "OVERVIEW": "The Boss series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt, cinders, bombs and volcanic rocks. Boss soils are on cinder cones. Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

The original Official Series Description was updated to reflect current soil taxonomy, to clearly define the range of characteristics, and to improve interpretations.  The central concept, definition, and historical importance of the series was preserved.\nSoil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999"
