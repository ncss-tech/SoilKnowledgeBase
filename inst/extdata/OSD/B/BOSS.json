These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt, cinders, bombs, and volcanic rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days."
