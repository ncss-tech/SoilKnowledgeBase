  "STATES": "CO,NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium that may be underlain by residuum derived from mixed sources.  Blackston soils are on edges of old high terraces, on fan remnants and on structural benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
