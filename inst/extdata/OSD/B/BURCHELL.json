  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Burchell soils occur in a semiarid, mesothermal climate. with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters; an average January temperature of 45 degrees F; and average July temperature of 80 F with a mean annual temperature of 62 degrees F and an average frost-free season of about 255 days.\nCharacteristically the Burchell soils have thick, dark grayish brown, medium textured, neutral to mildly alkaline A1 horizons.  Colors range from grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or dark gray (10YR 4/1) and from dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist in the A1 horizons. Texture of the A1 horizon ranges from loam to silty clay loam.\nThick grayish brown moderately fine textured, slightly calcareous B2 horizons.  The reaction varies from neutral to moderately alkaline, pH 8.0 to 9.0, in the B horizon, with slight to moderate concentrations of soluble salts associated with the higher pH range.  The B2 horizon is somewhat finer textured, usually being clay loam or silty clay loam.\nStratified, mottled and slightly calcareous C horizons.\nColors are fairly uniform in the lower horizons.  Soils are rather variable in depth to calcareous material over short distances.  The parent material is usually stratified, the strata ranging from fine sandy loam to silt loam in texture and are of variable thickness."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  They resemble the Capay, Chino, Marguerite, Orestimba, and Temple series in some respects.  The Capay soils are developed in alluvium from sedimentary and basic igneous rocks and are fine textured with clayey columnar to prismatic B2 horizons.  The Chino soils, developed in granitic alluvium, are noncalcareous in the B2 horizon and have distinct zones of lime accumulation in the lower B or upper C horizons.  The Marguerite soils are well drained and noncalcareous throughout.  The Orestimba soils, developed in alluvium from sandstone and shale, are moderately fine textured throughout.  The Temple soils are developed in predominantly granitic alluvium and have slightly acid to neutral A1 and B1 horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The parent material alluvium is dominantly from dark colored slates but in past from basic igneous rocks.  Burchell soils occur in low, imperfectly drained parts of alluvial fans of minor streams on the east side of the northern and central San Joaquin Valley, California.  The Burchell soils occur at elevations of 25 to about 200 feet in a semiarid, mesothermal climate having a mean annual precipitation of 12 to 14 inches.  Average frost-free season is about 255 days."
