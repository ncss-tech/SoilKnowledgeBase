  "OVERVIEW": "The Baca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed material from Tertiary pedisediments modified by wind. Baca soils are on plains and uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
