  "STATES": "NE,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Busher series consists of deep, well drained soils. Permeability is moderately rapid. They formed in eolian sediment of material weathered from soft fine grain sandstone on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches at the type location.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon:  Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (A horizon).  Cambic horizon - the zone from a depth of 10 inches to 24 inches (Bw horizon).\nGlass shards are present throughout the profile and have abnormally high values of cation exchange capacity and 15-bar-water percentage. The 15-bar water to clay ratio commonly exceeds 1.\nThe Busher soils were previously correlated in the Vebar series. Vebar is now in the frigid soil temperature regime. The Busher series was formerly classified as coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Torriothentic Haplustolls.  The soil was determined to have a cambic horizon and therefore was reclassified.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data for the Busher soil is available in the National Soil Survey Laboratory. Sample numbers S73NE-23-12, S78NE-123-013, S84NE-165-023, S88NE-031-032.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
