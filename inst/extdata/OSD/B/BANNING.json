  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 degrees to 56 degrees F.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 5 to 25 percent pebbles.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick.  Mottles of chroma of 3 or more range from few to common in the A and upper B horizons.  In some pedons mottles are lacking in the Ap horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  It averages 20 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  Value of 4 moist occurs at a depth of more than 20 inches.  This horizon is clay loam or gravelly clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is stratified with coarser textures in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Coolbrith, Dotta, Drews, Gorman, Harriman, Miramar, Supan, Van Dusen, Waha, and Wapinitia series.  Coolbrith soils are moderately well drained and lack mottles in the A and upper B horizons and are dry in the moisture control section from about June 15 to November 15.  Dotta soils lack mottles and have 18 to 27 percent clay in the B2t horizon and have a sandy loam C horizon.  Drews and Harriman soils are well drained and lack mottles.  Also, Drews soils are dry for 100 to 115 days and the Harriman soils are usually dry and neutral or mildly alkaline in the solum.  Gorman soils have a sandy clay loam B2t horizon averaging 20 to 28 percent clay and have 15 to 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the A and B horizons.  Miramar soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.; Supan soils are well drained, lack mottles, and have a lithic contact at a depth below 40 inches.  Van Dusen soils are well drained, lack mottles, have mean annual soil temperature of 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., and are high in quartz mica.  Waha soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Wapinitia soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, are dry for more than 60 consecutive days, have mean annual soil temperature of 48 degrees to 52 degrees F., and are well drained and lack mottles."

The soils formed in alluvium weathered from metamorphic, granitic, and ultramafic rocks.  The climate is characterized by having warm dry summers and cool moist winters with an annual precipitation of 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 140 to 235 days."
