  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 11 to 25 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Coarse fragments in the form of hard fine shale channers are typically less than 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. It is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days between July 1 and October 15 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Cracks one cm. wide typically extend to the surface of most pedons.  It is moderately acid through strongly acid.\nAn AB or BA horizon occurs in some pedons.  They have the same range in characteristics as the A and B horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon averages 60 to 75 percent clay.  Cracks one cm. wide or wider extend through this horizon.  Structure is typically angular or subangular blocky with common vertical pressure faces occurring on faces of peds.  It is strongly  through extremely acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon averages 60 to 75 percent clay.  Cracks one cm. wide or wider are common to 30 inches or more.  Authigenic gypsum crystals occur in few to common masses and nests in some pedons.  It is very strongly or extremely acid."

The soils formed in fine textured slope alluvium derived from acid shale.  Elevations are 3,800 to 4,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, and September.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
