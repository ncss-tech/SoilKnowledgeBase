  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackleed series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from granite.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Blackleed soils have profile textures ranging from sandy loam to loam with from 5 to 15 percent clay and have increasing quantity of igneous pebbles ranging from 20 to 35 percent in the surface horizons to 60 to 70 percent in substrata horizons.  They range from slightly to strongly acid and have an estimated 40 to 85 percent base saturation.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 43 degrees F. and the average summer soil temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 55 degrees F.  Hue ranges from 2.5Y to 7.5YR.  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches.  The A1 horizon has value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A&B horizon has value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 3 through 6.  Lamellae of accumulated clay comprise from 1 to 5 percent of the soil mass.  Cusps of illuvial clay are on the undersides of some pebbles and stones."
