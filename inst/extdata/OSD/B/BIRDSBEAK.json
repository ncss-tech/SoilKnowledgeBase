  "OVERVIEW": "The Birdsbeak series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from schist.  Birdsbeak soils are on hills and have slopes of 10 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
