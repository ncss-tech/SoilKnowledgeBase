  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Larose series in the same family, and the Arat, Bancker, Gentilly, and Scatlake series in closely related families. Bancker soils are in brackish marshes, have more than 15 percent sodium in the control section, and do not have logs or other woody material in the lower layers. Gentilly soils are in freshwater to brackish marshes and are underlain at 20 to 40 inches below the mineral surface by layers with n-value of 0.7 or less. Larose soils do not have logs and wood fragments within the profile and are in freshwater marshes. Scatlake soils have more than 20 percent sodium in the control section. Arat soils are in a fine-silty particle size family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Barbary soils are in low, large, ponded backswamps of the lower Mississippi River and other smaller river or distributary flood plains. They formed in clays that were deposited in water and have never air dried. The climate is humid subtropical. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 64 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F. Slope is less than 1 percent."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Larose soils, the closely related Arat and Gentilly soils, and the Allemands, Fausse, Harahan, Maurepas, and Schriever soils. Allemands soils are in freshwater marshes and have a histic epipedon more than 16 inches thick. Fausse soils are on slightly higher backswamp positions and have n-value less than 0.7 in some layer within 20 inches, and below 36 inches. Harahan soils are on artificially drained, pump-off areas and have a solum 20 to 40 inches thick with n-value less than 0.7. Maurepas soils have organic materials to a depth of 51 or more inches. Schriever soils are on higher backswamp positions and have n-value less than 0.7 in all layers to a depth of 60 or more inches."

A water table ranges from 1 foot above the surface to 0.5 foot below surface continuously. They flood frequently or very frequently for long durations."
