  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. Soil between depths of 12 to 24 inches is usually moist in some part shortly after the first of November and stays moist until sometime in May and is dry all through the year. Coarse and very coarse rounded sand particles make up less than 20 percent of the soil. The soil is slightly to moderately acid, usually near pH 6.0. Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent to a depth of about 12 inches and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent throughout the rest of the profile.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 4/2). It is fine sandy loam or light loam with or without siliceous shale fragments. It has weak to strong granular structure.\nThe B2t horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 7/3, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4. It is loam or heavy loam and has 18 to 25 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent siliceous shale fragments. The clay increase from the A horizon to the B horizon is small but distinct, well over 3 percent.  This horizon has weak blocky structure or it is massive.\nThe C horizon has color of (10YR 7/3, 6/3 or 5/4. It is sandy loam or loamy sand and has 25 to 90 percent siliceous shale fragments."

Chualar soils have a moderately developed B2t horizon with more than 20 percent coarse and very coarse angular sand particles. Gilroy and Soper soils are underlain by bedrock at a depth of about 20 to 40 inches. Pinto soils have an abrupt A/B horizon boundary and lack a transitional horizon between the A horizon and the B2t horizon. Shimmon soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Tehechapi soils have a B2t horizon with 25 to 35 percent clay and siliceous shale fragments."
