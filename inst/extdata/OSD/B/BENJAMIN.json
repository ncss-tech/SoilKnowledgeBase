This soil is dry in some part of the 7 to 20 inches depth for 90 consecutive days but is not dry in all parts for 60 consecutive days.\nThe mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick and organic matter decreases irregularly or remains above 0.5 percent to depth of 50 inches. Depth to water table ranges from 30 to 60 inches. This soils has chroma of 1 if not mottled, or if mottled chroma of 2 or less at some depth between 20 and 40 inches. Lime content ranges from 15 to 30 percent. The soils are moderately to strongly alkaline and are slightly to strongly saline. The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section is clay, or silty clay, with more than 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. Some pedons have layers of silt loam or coarser material, more than 12 inches thick, at depths of 38 to 50 inches."

Hussman soils are mottled within 20 inches, noncalcareous in surface and have less than 15 percent lime in the C horizon. Jura soils are slightly calcareous, and lack subsurface mottling. Pack, and Shay soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick. Also, Pack soils have less than 35 percent clay. Salt Lake soils are poorly drained, have chroma of 1, are carbonatic and have calcic horizons. Ucolo soils lack characteristics of wetness within 40 inches."
