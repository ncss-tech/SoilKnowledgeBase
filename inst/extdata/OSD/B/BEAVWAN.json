  "OVERVIEW": "The Beavwan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans or outwash fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
