  "OVERVIEW": "The Binton series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous alluvium on low terraces and alluvial fans along flood plains.  These soils have slow permeability.  Slopes are typically less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 15 to 60 percent throughout the control section.  The soils are typically calcareous throughout but may be leached in some pedons for a few inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the control section ranges from 2 to 15 percent and is variable from strata to strata.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the mean annual summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle size control section is highly stratified and averages loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 40 to 70 percent silt, and 15 to 35 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragment content of the particle size control section is typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent fine gravel.  EC of the entire soil ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe highly stratified C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Reaction of the entire matrix is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline, but individual strata containing salt may be buffered to moderately alkaline."

The Jocity, Lostwells, and Youngston soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout.  The Toddler soils contain 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Binton soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial terraces or fans along flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium of varying textures from calcareous sodic sandstone and shale.  Elevation ranges from 3,800 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches but ranges from 6 to 10 inches with over half falling as snow and rain in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 days to 125 days."
