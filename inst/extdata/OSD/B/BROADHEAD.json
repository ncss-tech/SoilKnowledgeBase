Arcia, Cristo and Sweitberg soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Bumpheads soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Arva soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Rugar soils have iron-manganese nodules and redoximorphic concentrations in the Bt horizon.  Schnipps soils are deep to a lithic contact. Henefer soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon."

The soils formed in glacial drift, colluvium and alluvium derived mainly from mixed intermediate igneous parent rocks and some sandstone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. the mean summer temperature is about 63 to 65 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 to 25 inches.  The freeze-free period is about 50 to 110 days."
