  "OVERVIEW": "The Broadhead series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial drift and colluvium weathered from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Broadhead soils are on fan remnants, hills, and mountain slopes and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. the mean summer temperature is about 63 to 65 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 to 25 inches.  The freeze-free period is about 50 to 110 days."
