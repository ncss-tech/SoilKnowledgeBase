  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rippable shale bedrock is at a depth between 10 and 20 inches.  Rock fragments of shale range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum and 5 to 50 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or their channery analogues.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or their channery analogues.\nThe Bw/Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, silty clay, or their channery analogues.  The B horizon is dominantly a cambic horizon, but in some part, but less than 50 percent, there is in each pedon enough clay increase for and argillic horizon or has other evidence of clay eluviation.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the Bw/Bt horizon with increasing rock fragment content.."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils in other families include the Catoctin, Dandridge, Montevallo and Webbtown series.  All these soils have more than 35 percent fragments in the control section.  In addition, Catoctin and Webbtown soils are greater than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Dandridge soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches.  Montevallo soils have base saturation less than 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bays soils are on strongly sloping to very steep shale uplands with narrow convex ridgetops and long convex side slopes.  Slopes commonly are 12 to 65 percent but range from 5 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from calcareous shale.  Mean annual air temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches near the type location."

Bellamy soils, on stream terraces, are moderately well drained and have a brittle layer in the subsoil.  Bloomingdale soils, on flood plains, are poorly drained.
