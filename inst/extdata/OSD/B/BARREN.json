  "STATES": "NJ,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barren series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils. The soils formed in a thick mantle of sandy dredge spoils from dredging activities in coastal waters and rivers. The sandy dredge material is thicker than 100 cm and occurs on modified landscapes in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the surface and very high in the subsoil and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1196 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the sandy dredge material ranges from 100 to 200 centimeters and is sourced from coastal waterways, bays, or rivers. Rock fragments, including shell fragments, range from 0 to 20 percent. Human artifacts range from 0 to 10 percent. Soil textures include loamy fine sand or coarser. Pockets of clay or peat may be present. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is typically weak, very fine granular structure with low organic matter accumulations. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6. The upper part is typically weak very fine subangular blocky structure. The lower part is typically structureless and massive. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^Cg or ^C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4. This horizon is typically structureless, massive or single grain. The horizon may effervesce in the lower part. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nIn some pedons buried natural horizons may occur below the control section. Their properties are variable."

These soils formed in human-transported soil material from dredging activities of nearby shorelines, waterways, bays or rivers, in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

The well to excessively drained Bigapple, moderately well drained Fortress, and poorly drained Jamaica soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Breeze soils average more than 10 percent (by volume) human artifacts throughout. Hooksan soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. Ipswich, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, and Sandyhook soils are subject to tide flooding. Verrazano soils have a contrasting particle size class in the control section."
