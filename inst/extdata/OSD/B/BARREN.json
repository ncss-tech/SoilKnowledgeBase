  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the sandy dredge material ranges from 100 to 200 centimeters and is sourced from coastal waterways, bays, or rivers. Rock fragments, including shell fragments, range from 0 to 20 percent. Human artifacts range from 0 to 10 percent. Soil textures include loamy fine sand or coarser. Pockets of clay or peat may be present. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is typically weak, very fine granular structure with low organic matter accumulations. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6. The upper part is typically weak very fine subangular blocky structure. The lower part is typically structureless and massive. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^Cg or ^C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4. This horizon is typically structureless, massive or single grain. The horizon may effervesce in the lower part. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nIn some pedons buried natural horizons may occur below the control section. Their properties are variable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Jamaica series is in the same family. Jamaica soils formed in the same parent materials but have a shallower seasonal high water table and are considered poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Barren soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping artificially-created or human-altered landforms. These soils formed in human-transported soil material from dredging activities of nearby shorelines, waterways, bays or rivers, in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

The well to excessively drained Bigapple, moderately well drained Fortress, and poorly drained Jamaica soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Breeze soils average more than 10 percent (by volume) human artifacts throughout. Hooksan soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. Ipswich, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, and Sandyhook soils are subject to tide flooding. Verrazano soils have a contrasting particle size class in the control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the surface and very high in the subsoil and substratum. Some pedons may be subject to coastal flooding during severe storm events."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
