Boistfort soils are on foothills and mountains and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Rock fragments average less than 10 percent in the particle-size control section.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 95 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 15 to 20 percent for air dried samples.  Under forest cover, the mean annual soil temperature is about 50 degrees F. and ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 14 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3 when rubbed and moist and and value and chroma are 2,3, or 4 when dry.  This horizon is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nSome pedons have AB and BA horizons.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry and chroma 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry.  The apparent field texture averages clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay, but in some thin subhorizons it is gravelly or cobbly silty clay loam, gravelly or cobbly clay loam, or gravelly or cobbly silty clay.  This horizon is moderately acid to extremely acid.  It has 1 to 10 percent organic matter decreasing to less than 7 percent below 20 inches."

The upper 19 inches of the particle-size control section has andic soil properties.  The ratio of 15 bar water to clay is less than 1.0 and the CEC is less than 150 meq per 100g clay due to better than \"normal\" dispersion in one horizon.  This description reflects a change in classification based on amendment 16.  All depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon."
