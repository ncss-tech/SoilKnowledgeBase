  "OVERVIEW": "The Blue Star series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks. The Blue Star soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
