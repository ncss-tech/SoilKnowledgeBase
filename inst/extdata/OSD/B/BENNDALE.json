  "OVERVIEW": "The Benndale series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on nearly level to strongly sloping marine terraces and high stream terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) and the Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152A) Major Land Resource Areas. They formed in thick beds of loamy fluviomarine or fluvial sediments. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 62 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
