The particle-size control section, the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon, is 8 to 18 percent clay, and the silt content is more than 20 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4. Texture is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 4. Texture is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe E/B horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Butters and Niwana series in the same family and the closely related Heidel and McLaurin series. Butters soils have less than 20 percent silt in the top 20 inches of the Bt horizon. Niwana soils have a glossic horizon and an ochric epipedon that is more than 20 inches in thickness. Heidel and McLaurin soils are on similar positions but have redder subsoils."

Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. They formed in thick beds of fluviomarine or fluvial deposits. The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the average annual rainfall ranges from 60 to 65 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit."

The excessively drained Alaga soils are on slightly higher positions and are sandy throughout. The poorly drained Atmore soils are in adjacent depressions and broad flats and have more than 5 percent plinthite in the profile. The somewhat poorly drained Basin soils are in adjacent depressions and broad flats and have fragipans. The moderately well or well drained Malbis soils are on similar to lower positions, have fine-loamy control sections and have more than 5 percent plinthite. The moderately well drained Ora and Savannah soils are on similar to lower positions, have fine-loamy control sections and fragipans.  Ruston soils are on similar positions, have fine-loamy control sections and have redder subsoils. The moderately well drained Saucier soils are on similar to lower positions, have fine-loamy subsoils and more than 5 percent plinthite in the profile."
