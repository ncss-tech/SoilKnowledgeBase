  "OVERVIEW": "The Bloom series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained moderately permeable soils that formed in silty mixed alluvial materials.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
