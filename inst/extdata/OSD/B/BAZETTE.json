  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 45 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Few to common, faint to distinct mottles of brown, brownish yellow, or light yellowish brown are present in some pedons.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent and reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.\nThe BC horizon is about one unit of value higher than the B2t horizon.  Some pedons are faintly to prominently mottled with chromas 2 through 6 in hues of 2.5Y or 10YR.  The gray colors are inherited from the shales.  The B3 horizon of some pedons also contain fragments of shale.  It ranges from medium acid through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous.\nThe C horizon has rock structure consisting of gray, grayish brown, or yellowish brown clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam, thinly bedded with shale.  It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline and some pedons contain a few fine calcium carbonate masses or concretions below a depth of 28 inches.  The C horizon of some pedons is calcareous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Other competing series are the Acove, Bexar, Bronte, Fulshear, Katemcy, Lindy, May, Miles, Pedernales, Steedman, Truce, and Winters series.  Acove soils have a paralithic contact to chalk and have more than 5 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon.  Bexar, Bronte, Fulshear, Katemcy, Lindy, Pedernales, Truce, and Winters soils have hues redder than 10YR in the Bt horizon.  May and Miles soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Steedman soils have a potential linear extensibility of 6 cm or more."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bazette soils occupy gently sloping to moderately steep uplands.  Slope gradients range from 3 to 20 percent, but are mainly 8 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in gray, yellow, and olive; medium acid to moderately alkaline clays and shales.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 50 inches; mean annual Thornthwaite P-E index is 62 to 72; and the mean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 70 degrees F."

Axtell and Crockett soils are on slightly smoother areas, have an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons, and have a potential linear extensibility of 6 cm or more.  Ellis and Ferris soils are on similar positions, are clayey throughout, and lack Bt horizons.  Wilson soils have chroma of less than 2 throughout the upper Bt horizons and are on lower nearly level areas."
