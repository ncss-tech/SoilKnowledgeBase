Bonnick and Gardone soils do not have firm, brittle horizons over 6 inches thick within 40 inches of the soil surface. Emamount soils do not have Bq horizons that are brittle, have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have endosaturation between 150 and 180 cm from the soil surface. Embal soils have mollic epipedons 50 to 90 cm thick and have irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth. Frentera, Stookmoor, and Wegert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils have buried duripans within 150 cm of the soil surface. Picturerock soils do not have firm, brittle horizons within 100 cm of the soil surface and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Borobey soils are on valley floors, lake terraces, and depressions on lava plateaus. These soils formed in pumiceous volcanic ash over alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,620 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 to -2 degrees C., and the mean July temperature is 15 to 16 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 38 cm (A horizon and part of the AB horizon). Dark Munsell colors extend to 53 cm, but organic matter content is less than one percent below 38 cm.\nDuric feature - The zone from 53 to 130 cm (Bq horizon).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (A and AB horizons and part of the Bq horizon).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to non-ashy material at 130 cm.\nBuried horizon - The zone from 130 to 150 cm (2Bwb horizon).\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (parts of the AB and Bq horizons).\nThis series was revised in 1999 to eliminate the Deep depth class. The phase of Borobey which is deep to a duripan from the Upper Deschutes River Area soil survey needs correlation to another series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location was reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S89OR-017-001. Data for optical grain counts of volcanic glass content, oxalate extractions for iron, aluminum, and silicon, and phosphate retention are available for the first three horizons of the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
