    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 18 through 25 inches (46 through 69 centimeters )and corresponds closely to the depth to outwash. Rock fragment content consists of 5 through 20 percent gravel and 0 through 10 percent cobbles in the solum. Stones and boulders are 0 through 20 percent in the surface and 0 through 10 percent in the subsoil. Gravel content is 0 through 30 percent, cobbles 0 through 10 percent and stones 0 through 10 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nMost pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam. The lower part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture in the lower part of the B is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand."

Branford soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout the B and C horizons. Haven soils are formed in loamy over sandy and gravelly outwash. Narragansett soils are formed in coarse-loamy deposits over sandy till."

The soils formed in loamy till over loose, sandy, or reworked outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 through 50 inches (889 through 1270 millimeters) and mean annual air temperature is 45 through 50 degrees F (7 through 10 degrees C).
