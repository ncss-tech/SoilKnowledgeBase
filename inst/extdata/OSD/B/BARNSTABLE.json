  "OVERVIEW": "The Barnstable series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till over loose, sandy outwash. They are on nearly level through moderately steep soils on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 through 35 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and high or very high in the substratum. Mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches (1092 millimeters) and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F (9 degrees C).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 18 through 25 inches (46 through 69 centimeters )and corresponds closely to the depth to outwash. Rock fragment content consists of 5 through 20 percent gravel and 0 through 10 percent cobbles in the solum. Stones and boulders are 0 through 20 percent in the surface and 0 through 10 percent in the subsoil. Gravel content is 0 through 30 percent, cobbles 0 through 10 percent and stones 0 through 10 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nMost pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam. The lower part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture in the lower part of the B is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand."
