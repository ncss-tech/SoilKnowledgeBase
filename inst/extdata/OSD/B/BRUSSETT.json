  "OVERVIEW": "The Brussett series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in transported materials.  Brussett soils are on fans, terraces, and uplands and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is about 45 degrees F. but ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 crushed.  Texture in uneroded areas is loam or silt loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or heavy loam and has 24 to 35 percent clay, 30 to 50 percent silt, and less than 15 percent fine and coarse sand.  B3ca horizons are normal, but are absent in some pedons."

The soils formed in deep, transported silt loam or loam materials deposited as glacio-lacustrine, glacial meltwaters, stream alluvium, or as eolian sediments.  The climate is cool, semiarid, continental with long, cold, dry winters and warm moist springs and summers.  The mean annual precipitation at the type location is 17 to 21 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, but ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period (32 degrees F.) is 115 to 125 days."
