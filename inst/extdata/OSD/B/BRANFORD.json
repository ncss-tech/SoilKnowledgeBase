  "REVDATE": "01/2005",
  "STATES": "CT,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Branford series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy over sandy and gravelly outwash.  They are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on outwash plains and terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum.   Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches and typically corresponds to the depth of contrasting sand or sand and gravel.  Rock fragments, mainly rounded pebbles, range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and from 10 to 65 percent in individual layers of the substratum.  Unless limed, the soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Fine earth texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam with less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  The Bw horizon has weak subangular blocky or granular structure or it is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 6.  The horizon is commonly stratified sand and gravel.  Texture of individual layers ranges from coarse sand or sand to loamy fine sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Agawam, Barnstable, Haven, and Narragansett soils are currently in the same family.\nAgawam and Haven soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower. The Barnstable and Narragansett series are in a similar family.  Barnstable soils formed in glacial till overlying outwash and have subangular or angular rock fragments larger than pebble-sized throughout.  Narrangansett do not have stratified sand and gravel in the substratum and have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the B horizon."

Slope commonly ranges from 0 to 8 percent but the range includes 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loamy over stratified sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial materials derived mainly from red sedimentary rocks and basalt.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 38 to 50 inches and the growing season is 140 to 185 days."

Bash soils are somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  Berlin soils are fine-textured soils on glaciolacustrine terraces.  Cheshire, Holyoke, Ludlow, Menlo, Watchaug, Wethersfield, Wilbraham and Yalesville soils are on nearby till plains, hills, and drumlins.  Ellington soils are moderately well drained.  Well drained Hartford soils, excessively drained Penwood soils, and somewhat excessively drained Manchester soils are terrace associates.  Raypol, Raynham and Walpole soils are poorly drained soils in low areas."
