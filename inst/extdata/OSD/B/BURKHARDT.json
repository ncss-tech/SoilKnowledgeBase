However, it is suspected that the very low CEC in the sandy outwash results in drastic changes in base saturation with the addition of a few bases from fertilization. These soils may be Inceptisols in their natural state.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska - 5 pedons (http://ssldata.nrcs.usda.gov/).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
