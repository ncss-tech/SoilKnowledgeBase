    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has 15 to 30 percent subrounded or rounded gravel or cobble.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 dry and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It has from 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, of which 20 to 50 percent are subrounded and rounded gravel and 15 to 40 percent rounded cobbles.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It has from 35 to 70 percent rock fragments, of which 20 to 50 percent are subrounded and rounded gravel and 15 to 40 percent rounded cobble.  It is a calcic horizon with 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon has properties similar to the Bk horizon except that it is not part of the calcic horizon, and has 5 to 10 percent less calcium carbonate than the overlying Bk horizon."
