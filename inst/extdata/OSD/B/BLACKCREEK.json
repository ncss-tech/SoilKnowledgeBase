  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash or lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash plains, outwash terraces and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
