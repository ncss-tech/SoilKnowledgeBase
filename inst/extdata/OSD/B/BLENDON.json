  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon typically is 24 to 36 inches thick but ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Depth to calcium carbonate typically is greater than 60 inches but ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Weak zones of calcium carbonate accumulation are in some pedons in the lower B and upper C horizon where finer-textured materials are in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but is loam in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam but some pedons are loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Some pedons contain 5 to 15 percent gravel by volume.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loamy fine sand or loamy sand but is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in some pedons.  Some pedons are gravelly sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.  Some pedons are sand or fine sand in the lower parts.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Loam or clay loam glacial till is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

Hawksprings soils have sandy-skeletal materials in the lower part of the control section.  Paoli soils have carbonates within depths of 40 inches.  Vetal soils have a drier soil moisture control section."

The Blendon soil formed in sandy glacial meltwater deposits or eolian deposits of mixed mineralogy.  The mean annual rainfall is about 17 to 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F."

Doger soils have a sandy control section.  Enet soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Henkin soils have mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Bon soils are on bottom lands and have a fine-loamy control section. Fedora soils have a more moist moisture control section and have a calcic horizon."
