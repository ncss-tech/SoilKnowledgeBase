These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days in late summer and early fall. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 40 inches. Rock fragments make up 35 to 85 percent of the layer between depths of 10 and 40 inches. The soils are slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is a gravelly or very gravelly loam and is 10 to 20 inches thick."
