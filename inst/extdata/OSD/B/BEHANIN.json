Mean annual soil temperature is about 34 to 40 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 48 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are slightly acid, medium acid, or neutral in the solum. The particle size control section averages gravelly and cobbly loam to very gravelly and very cobbly loam with about 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw (cambic) horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, cobbly loam, or very cobbly loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very gravelly and very cobbly sandy loam to very gravelly and very cobbly loam."

Blanca, Campone, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, Hobacker, Nevtah, Snag, and Spearhead soils lack cambic horizons. Croesus, Dateman, Nagitsy, and Prong soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Darland soils have less than 18 percent clay in the textural control section and have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 43 degrees F.  Caballo soils are calcareous below 28 inches.  Lolon soils have loose sand, gravel and cobbles at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Nevtah soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Marcetta soils have chroma of 1 in the A horizon and do not have cambic horizons.  Poleline soils have a mollic epipedon of 30 to 35 inches thick.  Nazaton soils have a mean annual soil temperature above 42 degrees F.  Belsac, Namela and Splitbutte soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Busterback soils have a lithologocal discontinuity of extremely gravelly sand at 30 inches.  Lionhead soils have a calcic horizon.  Lolon soils have a lithologocal discontinuity of loose sand at 28 inches.  Papaspila soils do not have cambic horizons.  Povey and Snopoc soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Behanin soils are on the steep to very steep north-facing colluvial slopes on hills, mountains, and ridges at elevations of 7,500 to 10,800 feet.  Slopes gradients range from 25 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from intermediate volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 45 to 70 days.  The mean annual temperature is 34 to 40 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F."
