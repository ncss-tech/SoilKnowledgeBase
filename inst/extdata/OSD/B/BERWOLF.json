  "OVERVIEW": "The Berwolf series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils derived from sandy sediments primarily from weathered sedimentary redbed rocks of Triassic age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on hillslopes, plains, and high terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 330 mm (13 in), and mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
