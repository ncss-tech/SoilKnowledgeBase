Native vegetation is primarily tall grasses such as little and sand bluestem, along with taller dropseed species.  The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn.  Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush make up the remaining woody species.  This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R070BY670TX)."
