  "OVERVIEW": "The Bear Basin series consists of well or moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from quartzite, sandstone and glacial drift. Bear Basin soils are on lateral moraines or glaciated mountain slopes and have slopes of 15 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
