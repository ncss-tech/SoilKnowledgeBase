Depth to the upper boundary of the Bt horizon ranges from 18 to 24 inches. The E horizon tongues 2 to 8 inches into the Bt horizon. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 degrees to 42 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is gravelly loam or gravelly heavy sandy loam, has 15 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles, and is 12 to 20 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. it ranges from gravelly sandy clay loam to gravelly clay loam or gravelly heavy loam. Gravel and cobble content ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 5. It has 40 to 60 percent gravel and cobbles. In some pedons the C horizon is stony."

Elevations range from 7,500 to 8,500 feet.  These soils formed in material weathered from mixed quartzite, sandstone and glacial drift. The climate is humid. Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 degrees to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 20 to 50 days."
