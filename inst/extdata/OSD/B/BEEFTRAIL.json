Branham soils are coarse loamy, having inherited a higher percentage of clay from the local geologic material.  They occur on similar landscape positions.  Zonite soils are very shallow to bedrock and occur on convex shoulder or nose slopes and ridges.  Highrye soils are deeper that 40 inches to bedrock, are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon.  They occur in more depositional positions such as concave swales or footslopes."

Beeftrail soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.  Gravel throughout the profile are primarily fine pea gravel less than 7 mm in diameter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
