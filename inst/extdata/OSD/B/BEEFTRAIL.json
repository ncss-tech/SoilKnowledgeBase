  "OVERVIEW": "The Beeftrail series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in residuum from granite or other coarse grained igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils occur on hillslopes, ridges, mountain flanks and bedrock floored pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

Branham soils are coarse loamy, having inherited a higher percentage of clay from the local geologic material.  They occur on similar landscape positions.  Zonite soils are very shallow to bedrock and occur on convex shoulder or nose slopes and ridges.  Highrye soils are deeper that 40 inches to bedrock, are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon.  They occur in more depositional positions such as concave swales or footslopes."
