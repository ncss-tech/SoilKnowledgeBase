The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 35\ninches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and\nchroma of 1 or 2 moist, 2 or 3 dry.

Glean and Lambring soils are dry\nmore than half the time when the temperature is greater than\n41 degrees F and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Rondowa soils have a strong influence from volcanic ash in the\nupper part and lack B horizons.  Webfoot soils are somewhat\npoorly drained with gleyed conditions at 25 to 35 inches."
