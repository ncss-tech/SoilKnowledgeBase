  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches and includes all or part of the Bt horizon.  Some pedons contain up to 10 percent by volume of rock fragments throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam but is silt loam or clay loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay or clay loam averaging between 35 and 45 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Dark tongues of A material extend into the Bt and Bk horizons on the vertical faces of peds in some pedons.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or clay and contains common or many, fine or medium accumulations of calcium carbonate.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Shale fragments are in the lower part of the Bk horizon in some pedons.  Many or common nests of gypsum are in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Few or common nests of gypsum are in some pedons. Mottles inherent to the parent material are common in the lower C horizons.  Shale fragments are in the C horizon of some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Carlson, Harney, McClure, Mento, Peno, Raber, Reliance, and Spearville series in the same family. The Carlson soils formed in residuum weathered from chalk and limestone and old alluvium.  The Harney, McClure, Mento, Reliance, and Spearville soils contain more silt in the solum and formed in silty sediments.  In addition, McClure soils have contrasting clayey 2C horizons and the Mento soils have 5 to 15 percent sodium in the B and C horizons. Peno soils have thinner sola and have calcium carbonate at shallower depths. Raber soils have thinner A horizons and are drier."

Surfaces are smooth, plane, or convex.  These soils formed in clay loam glacial till.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches."

The Dudley, Jerauld, and Stickney soils have natric horizons and are on nearly level, plane to slightly concave surfaces and are in slightly lower positions.  Tetonka soils are in depressions and have E horizons. The Houdek and Prosper soils are fine-loamy.  In addition, the Prosper soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick. Houdek soils are on similar landscape positions. The Prosper soils are on plane or slightly concave positions in upland swales and on foot slopes."
