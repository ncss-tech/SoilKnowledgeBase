  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluemass series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  Bluemass soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
