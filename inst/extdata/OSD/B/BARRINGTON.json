  "STATES": "IL,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barrington series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess or water-laid silty material and the underlying calcareous stratified loamy outwash. These soils are on level to gently sloping outwash plains, stream terraces, and lake plains. They have slope gradients ranging from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches).",
