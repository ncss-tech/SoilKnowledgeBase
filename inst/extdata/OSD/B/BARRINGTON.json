The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches) in thickness.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral depending upon liming practices.\nThe BA and Bt horizons has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Some pedons have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part.

Assumption, Aviston, Clare, Dana, and Totanang soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) to carbonates. Blackberry, Buckhart, Catlin, and Harrison soils do not have as much as 15 percent sand within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont, and Saybrook soils are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section and have a well graded sand fraction to a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) or more. Keltner soils have a paralithic contact in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Barrington soils are on nearly level to gently undulating convex slopes on outwash plains, stream terraces, and lake plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients commonly are between 1 and 3 percent but range from 0 to 7 percent. These soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying calcareous, stratified loamy outwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation from 760 to 970 mm (30 to 38 inches), frost free days range from 140 to180, and the elevation ranges from 165 to 415 meters (540 to 1360 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Mundelein soils are on broad nearly level areas adjacent to Barrington soils and form a drainage sequence with them. The moderately well drained Grays soils have a thinner dark colored surface layer and are on similar landforms adjacent to Barrington soils."

An apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) below the surface at some time between February and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."
