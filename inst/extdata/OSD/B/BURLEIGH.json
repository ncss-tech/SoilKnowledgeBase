These soils formed in sandy deposits over loamy and sandy stratified lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 813 mm (26 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.5 to 7.8 degrees C (42 to 46 degrees F). Mean summer temperature ranges from 14.4 to 20 degrees C (58 to 68 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bruce, Ingalls, Ocqueoc, and Roscommon soils. The somewhat poorly drained Ingalls and moderately well drained and well drained Ocqueoc soils are closely associated in a drainage sequence with the Burleigh soils. Bruce and Roscommon soils are associated on some lake plains. Bruce soils do not have the sandy A and Cg1 horizons. Roscommon soils do not have loamy 2Cg2 horizons."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy deposits and moderately high in the lacustrine deposits. Permeability is rapid or moderately rapid in the A and Cg horizons and moderately slow in the 2Cg horizon."
