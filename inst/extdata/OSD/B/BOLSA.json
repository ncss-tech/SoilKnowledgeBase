The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is about 62 degrees F.  The soil is saturated within 40 to 60 inches of the surface from about February to May unless drained.  The soil is calcareous to a depth of 40 inches or more and is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The 10- to 40-inch section averages 18 ro 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser particles.  Organic matter decreases irregularly as depth increases.\nThe A horizon is light brownish gray and pale brown in 10YR hue.  It ranges from sandy loam to silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon is light gray, light brownish gray or pale brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  It has distinct or prominent mottles below a depth of about 30 inches.  This horizon is mainly silt loam and silty clay loam but has thin strata of sandier material in some pedons.  It has buried A horizons in many pedons."
