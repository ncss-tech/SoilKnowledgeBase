  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches usually is moist in some part from sometime in November until sometime in May and is dry all the rest of the year if not irrigated.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is about 62 degrees F.  The soil is saturated within 40 to 60 inches of the surface from about February to May unless drained.  The soil is calcareous to a depth of 40 inches or more and is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The 10- to 40-inch section averages 18 ro 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser particles.  Organic matter decreases irregularly as depth increases.\nThe A horizon is light brownish gray and pale brown in 10YR hue.  It ranges from sandy loam to silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon is light gray, light brownish gray or pale brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  It has distinct or prominent mottles below a depth of about 30 inches.  This horizon is mainly silt loam and silty clay loam but has thin strata of sandier material in some pedons.  It has buried A horizons in many pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bolsa soils are nearly level and are in flood plains and basins at elevations of 10 to 300 feet.  They formed in stratified alluvium derived from mixed sources.  The climate is dry subhumid meso-thermal with cool moist winters and foggy dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F; average January temperature is about 53 degrees F; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 300 to 365 days."

Landlow soils have more than 35 percent clay.  Metz and San Emigdio soils are not saturated above depth of 60 inches for any appreciable time.  Mocho and Sorrento soils have mollic epipedons."
