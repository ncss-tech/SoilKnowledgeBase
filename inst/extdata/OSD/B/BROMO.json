  "OVERVIEW": "The Bromo series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in aerially deposited dacitic pumice and volcanic ash.  Bromo soils are on mountainsides, benches and broad ridgetops at elevations of l,800 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Soil sample numbers are 78T7639 and 78T7640, Lewis County, Washington.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 10 inches, a spodic-like horizon from 10 to 35 inches,  and a lithologic change from volcanic cindery to weathered volcanic ash at 23 inches.  The spodic-like horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but it is assumed to have silt-sized and larger pellets and cracked coatings."
