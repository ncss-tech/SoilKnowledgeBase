These soils formed in pumice and volcanic ash in the upper part and material weathered from andesite and volcanic ash in the lower part.  The pumice layer is Mt. St. Helens \"layer Y', deposited about 3,200 years ago.  The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches including snowfall.  Mean annual temperature  is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees  F.) is l50 to l80 days."

Soil sample numbers are 78T7639 and 78T7640, Lewis County, Washington.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 10 inches, a spodic-like horizon from 10 to 35 inches,  and a lithologic change from volcanic cindery to weathered volcanic ash at 23 inches.  The spodic-like horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but it is assumed to have silt-sized and larger pellets and cracked coatings.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
