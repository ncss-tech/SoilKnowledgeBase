  "OVERVIEW": "The Backbay series consist of very deep, very poorly drained soils in coastal marshes.  They are mineral soils that have a thin organic surface layer derived from herbaceous plant remains.  These soils formed in loamy sediments in marshes along the Atlantic Coastal Plain.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The upper 20 inches of the mineral soil does not have sulfidic materials and the n-value is less than 0.7 in the mineral layers.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the organic surface layer and from strongly acid through neutral in the mineral horizons.  Sulfur content in the organic surface layer ranges from about 0.1 to 1.4 percent. The organic material is mainly from herbaceous plants.\nThe 0 horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is mucky peat or muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5B or is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It commonly is stratified and has subhorizons of sandy or clayey materials.  Flakes of mica are few or common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Wasda series is the only other series in this family.  Wasda soils support merchantable trees.  Other series in closely related families include the Axis, Bohicket, Capers, Carteret, Currituck, Handsboro, Levy, and Rappahannock. Axis soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section and are flooded daily with seawater.  Bohicket and Capers soils have sulfidic materials in the upper 20 inches of the mineral soil material.  Carteret soils have a sandy particle size control section and are flooded daily with seawater.   Currituck, Handsboro, and Rappahannock are organic soils.  Levy soils have a fine particle size control section and n-values greater than 0.7."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Backbay soils are on fresh water and brackish water marshes along creeks, rivers, and sounds of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  They are not normally subject to the tidal effects of saline water.  They are irregularly flooded by wind tides throughout the year.  The soils formed primarily in loamy marine and fluvial sediments underlying thin organic materials from herbaceous plants.  The climate is humid temperate with mean annual precipitation of about 45 inches and mean annual temperature of about 59 degrees F near the type location."

All of these soils, except Delway and Longshoal, are at higher elevations.  In addition, Dragston, Munden, and Nimmo soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section. Duckston soils are sandy throughout.  Tomotley soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Delway and Longshoal soils are Histosols."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Backbay soils are used mainly as wetland wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is dominantly needlegrass rush (Juncus roemerianus), saltmarsh bulrush (Scirpus robustus), big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides), narrowleaf cattail (Typha angustifolia), and other aquatic plants.  Areas transitional to higher elevations have scattered eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia), waxmyrtle (Myrica cerifera), and black willow (Salix nigra) shrubs."
