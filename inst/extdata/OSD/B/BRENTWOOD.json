  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Disseminated or segregated lime is present in some pedons below a depth of 36 inches and is lacking in all parts of other pedons.  The 10 to 40 inch section contains 35 to 40 percent clay and a little more than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.  Clay films may be few or common but there is less than 20 percent more clay in the B horizon than in the A horizon.  A small amount of clay-size minerals has been produced by weathering of primary minerals in some pedons.  The mean soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 64 degrees F, and the soil temperature remains above 47 degrees F at all times.  The soils are usually moist in some or all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches from early December until May.  The soils are dry, unless irrigated all the rest of the time.\nThe A horizon is brown, grayish brown, dark grayish brown or dark brown.  It is clay loam, light silty clay or silt loam.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid t moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown, brown, dark yellowish brown or yellowish brown.  It is heavy clay loam, heavy silty clay loam or clay.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline but is usually alkaline.\nThe lower part of the C horizon is yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, pale brown, dark yellowish brown or brown.  Few faint mottles are present below a depth of 35 inches in some pedons and mottles are entirely lacking in other pedons."

The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal, with hot dry summers, and cool moist winters.  Mean annual rainfall is 12 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F, average January temperature is about 46 degrees F, and the average July temperature is about 76 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 245 to 300 days."
