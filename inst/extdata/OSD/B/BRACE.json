  "OVERVIEW": "The Brace series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from welded rhyolitic tuff and basalt. Brace soils are on structural benches, hills, and lava plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
