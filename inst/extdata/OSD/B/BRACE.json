These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from welded rhyolitic tuff and basalt. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,250 to 1,895 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
