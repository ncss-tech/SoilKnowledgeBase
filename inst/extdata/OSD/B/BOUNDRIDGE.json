  "OVERVIEW": "The Boundridge series consists of shallow to a duripan, well-drained soils formed in alluvium from chert, sandstone and quartzite.  Boundridge soils are on terrace summits, ridge tops and fan terraces. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degree F.",
