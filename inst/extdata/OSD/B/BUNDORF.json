  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bundorf series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Bundorf soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
