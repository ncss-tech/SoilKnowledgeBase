    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bundorf soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from mixed volcanic rocks with an admixture of eolian materials.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 100 days."
