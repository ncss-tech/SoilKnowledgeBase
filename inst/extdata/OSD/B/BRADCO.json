The soil formed in glacial till influenced by loess and volcanic ash.  The till is derived from mixed volcanic rock.  The upper part of these soils has been slightly reworked by alluvial and colluvial action.  Elevations range from 6,200 to 6,700 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches being evenly distributed throughout the year.  Average annual temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F. The frost free period is less than 70 days."
