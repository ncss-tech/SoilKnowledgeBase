  "OVERVIEW": "The Briston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on remnant outwash terraces and alluvial fans in intermountain valleys and uplands. These soils are between mima mounds.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
