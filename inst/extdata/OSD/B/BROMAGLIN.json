  "OVERVIEW": "The Bromaglin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium on stream terraces and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
