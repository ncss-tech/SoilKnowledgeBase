  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bullflat series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium or colluvium from sedimentary sources.  Bullflat soils are on backslope and footslope positions on fans, terraces, benches, lower hillslopes, and in valleys in mountains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 508 cm (20 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
