    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 3 inches.  The control section is clay loam or loam and contains 20 to 35 percent clay.  Typically, the soil contains 5 to 10 percent by volume of coarse fragments as pebbles.  Some pedons contain up to 20 percent by volume of stones throughout the soil.  Mottles are inherent to the parent material.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or loam and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Many cultivated areas do not have a Bw horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.   It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has common or many accumulations of carbonate and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 25 percent.  An ABk horizon 4 to 25 inches thick is in some pedons.  Some pedons have a BCk or BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Surfaces are convex, and slope gradients range from 2 to over 60 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous loam or clay loam glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2800 to 3500.  Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2350 feet above sea level."

Native grasses are mainly needleandthread, blue grama, big bluestem, little bluestem, green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, plains muhly, and sideoats grama.  Where the Betts soils are in complex with other soils on undulating to rolling landscapes they are used for the growing of small grains, corn, and other feed crops."
