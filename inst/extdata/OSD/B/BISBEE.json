  "OVERVIEW": "The Bisbee series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian and outwash material from acidic igneous rocks. Bisbee soils are on dune-like terraces and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 475 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.",
