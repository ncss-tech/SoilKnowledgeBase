  "STATES": "NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beebe series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy alluvium derived mainly from sandstone.  These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

(A horizon)\nFluvent feature:  Irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth; or 0.2 percent or more organic carbon at a depth of 125 cm .\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy Eleventh Edition, 20010.\nLaboratory data are available for this pedon. All pH values given are of soil paste.  Utah State University lab nos. U584644 through U584649 (dated 1967); source: Carbon-Emery soil survey area, Utah, SCS, 1970.\nOwnership was transferred from Phoenix, Arizona to Lakewood, Colorado, 09/2010.\nThe pedon used is borderline in the particle size class from sandy to sandy over loamy. Some pedons lack the loam horizon or in some pedons the thickness of the loam horizon is only 2 inches (too thin for sandy over loamy particle size class). More documentation is needed to justify the sandy over loamy particle size class.\nBeebe will be limited to 47 to 52 degrees F. for MAST.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
