  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to\nsandstone ranges 20 to 40 inches.  Ironstone and sandstone\npebbles and sandstone fragments less than an inch to 3\ninches thick and 3 to about 10 inches across the long axis\ncover 0 to 20 percent of the soil surface.  Pebbles and\nfragments comprise 0 to 35 percent of the epipedon and 0 to\n10 percent in the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 through\n7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The E horizon is 1 to 3 units\nhigher in value and chroma than the A1 horizon.  Texture is\nloam, fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand and their gravelly\nor stony counterparts.  The reaction ranges from medium acid\nthrough neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4\nthrough 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Mottles in these\ncolors and in other shades of red and brown range from none\nto common.  The texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay.\nReaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe BC horizon, when present, is in shades of red, brown, or\nyellow and is typically mottled or has common to many\nmottles in these colors.  It is sandy clay loam or clay\nloam.  The reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.  It is\nslightly acid in some pedons.  Sandstone and ironstone\nfragments larger than 2 mm across range from 2 to 35 percent\nby volume.\nThe Cr layer is weakly cemented sandstone and is typically\nstratified with shaly or loamy materials.  The strata are\nreddish, yellowish, or grayish.  The sandstone is fractured\nor weakly consolidated and hardens upon exposure."

Bonti soils have a lithic contact of sandstone at\na depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Castell soils formed in gneiss.  Shatruce soils formed in shaly materials.  Darst soils\nformed in siltstone or mudstone.  Jedd soils have an\nargillic horizon less than 16 inches thick and formed in the\nTertiary system.  Rosanky and Travis soils have sola more\nthan 40 inches thick.  Aubrey soils have base saturation of\nmore than 40 inches thick, montmorillonitic mineralogy and\nvertic properties."

Slopes range from about 2 to 20 percent.  The soil\nformed in loamy and clayey sediments high in iron in the\nCretaceous Period.  Climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 38 inches.  Mean annual\ntemperature is 66 degrees to 68 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite\nannual P-E index is 52 to 62."
