  "OVERVIEW": "The Bagger series consists of deep to very deep, well drained altered soils that formed in fill material derived from mixed but dominantly granitic sources that has been mixed by land leveling. Bagger soils are on terraces, and drainageways that have been filled and leveled due to land leveling activities.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a buried soil is 20 to 60 inches in most pedons and deeper than 60 inches in a few pedons.  Depth to a duripan where present is more than 40 inches.  The soil between a depth of 8 inches to 26 inches is dry in all parts from June to November and is moist in all parts from late  December till mid April and is moist in some  part the remainder of the time.  The mean annual temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F.  It does not drop below 47 degrees F during  any part of the year.  Fragments of argillic horizon occur in some or all parts of the fill between the 10 to 40 inch zone. The fragments are not arranged in any discernable order.  Fragments of hardpan average 0 to 15 percent in the 10 to 40 inch zone. Weighted average of clay content in the 10 to 40 inch zone is 10 to 18 percent.  The fill material is as variable as its source.\nThe Ap horizon and C horizon are fill material.  The fill material consists of two or more colors, mixed.  It is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 7/2, 8/2; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/2; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/4, 4/6; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6.  It is loamy sand to sandy clay loam but the average texture is sandy loam or loam.   Reaction ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline.  Some subhorizons may be calcareous.\nThe buried soil is variable."

The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 75 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."
