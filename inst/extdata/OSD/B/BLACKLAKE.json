  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacklake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are in open depressions, backswamps, and on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
