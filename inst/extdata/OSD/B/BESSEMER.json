  "OVERVIEW": "The Bessemer series consists of deep, slowly permeable soils on relict fan pediments.  They formed in high energy alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay or clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent and are mainly pebbles.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay or clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent and are mainly pebbles.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay modified by 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments are mainly pebbles and cobbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent commonly ranges from 6 to 14 percent; however, discontinuous pockets of mainly authigenic carbonates may exceed 14 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Hano soils have the top of a calcic horizon within a depth of 10 inches.  Lonti soils have a slightly acid or neutral Bt horizon.  Servilleta and Tobish soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Silva and Silver soils are 0 to 15 percent rock fragments to a depth of 40 inches."
