    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic carbon content ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 3 percent in the C horizon and decreases irregularly with depth.  Depth to continuous accumulations of carbonates is 0 to 10 inches.  The average exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 10 percent, but some pedon have subhorizons that are greater than 10 percent.  Redoximorphic features are common in the upper 18 inches.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The EC is 0 to 4 mmhos/cm and the calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 5 percent.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silty clay, clay, clay loam or silty clay loam, stratified with very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam or loamy fine sand.  In some pedons it has accumulations of carbonates, gypsum or salts.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The EC is 2 to 8 mmhos/cm and the calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 12 percent."

In addition, the Abbott soils occur in locations with 11 inches or less of annual precipitation.

Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 19 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
