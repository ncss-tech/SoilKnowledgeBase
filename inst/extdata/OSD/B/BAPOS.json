    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with and mapped as the Positas series in the Los Banos Area, California 1939 series report. These soils are being differentiated by higher pH and carbonates content. Former competing series included the Benridge, Hellman and Kimball soils. All three of these series may have an \"active\" cation exchange activity class that differentiates them from the Bapos and Honker series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (A1, A2 horizons)\nArgillic Horizon - The zone from 12 to 38 inches (Btk1, Btk2 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
