  "OVERVIEW": "The Belews Lake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils. These soils are on stream terraces within the Triassic Basin area of the mesic southern Piedmont. They formed in alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 44 inches near the type location.",
