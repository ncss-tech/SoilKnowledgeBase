    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Belews Lake soils were formerly included with the Hornsboro series. Due to the establishment of a mesic/thermic line in MLRA 136 Belews Lake is proposed to replace Hornsboro.  Lab data for Belews Lake does not support the presence of soluble salts, particulary sodium.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 8 inches. (Ap and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 80 inches below the surface.
