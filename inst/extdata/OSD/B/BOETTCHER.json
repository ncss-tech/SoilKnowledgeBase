  "OVERVIEW": "The Boettcher series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills, ridges and sides of terraces.  These soils formed in fine sediments weathered from shale.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 45 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is 59 degrees F.  Depth to uniform calcareous material ranges from 6 to 40 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 8 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and C horizon and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from clay loam to clay averaging 35 to 50 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent silt, and 15 to 45 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam or clay averaging 35 to 50 percent clay except that clay exceeds 50 percent in some pedons if total extensibility does not exceed 2.4 inches.  This horizon is usually moderately or strongly alkaline but is very strongly alkaline in some subhorizons of the Bk horizon.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from about 4 to 14 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boettcher soils are on upland hills and ridges.  Slopes typically range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 8,000 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in calcareous, fine textured sediments weathered from shale.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 9 to 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 38 degrees F and the mean summer temperature is 58 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 35 to 50 days.  In Montana, the Boettcher soils are at elevations of 2,500 to 4,500 feet with a frost-free season of 110 to 130 days and mean annual precipitation of 10 to 14 inches.  In Utah these soils are at 6,400 to 6,900 foot elevation and range up to 44 degrees air temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges to 14 inches and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
