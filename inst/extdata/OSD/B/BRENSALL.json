    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to calcium carbonate ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  Rock fragments range from 1 to 8 percent throughout, mostly pebble in size.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1or 2. It typically is clay loam, but the range includes loam.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Peds in the Bt horizon have common or many, faint or distinct clay films.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of  2.5Y, value of  4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. They are clay loam or loam. They are moderately alkaline and contain both diffuse and segregated carbonates.  There are common to many redox features above a depth of 40 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is clay loam or loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. There are common to many redox features."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from19 to 27 inches.  Annual frost free days are 120 to 170.  Elevation ranges from 890 to 1950 feet above mean sea level."
