  "OVERVIEW": "The Brensall series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in calcareous glacial till on uplands.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
