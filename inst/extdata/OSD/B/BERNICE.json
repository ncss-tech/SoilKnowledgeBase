  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bernice series consists of shallow to sand and gravel, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess over sand and gravel.  Bernice soils occur on glaciofluvial terraces and associated escarpments.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 3 to 7 inches in thickness.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 6 to 12 inches.  In some pedons, the diagnostic horizons may be convoluted due to frost churning or tree fall.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile is strongly to very strongly acid.\nAn A horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizons have hue from 10YR through 5YR, value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist of 3 or 4.  The BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture of the B horizons is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is dominantly sandy loam with thin stratas of silt and sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value moist of 3 or 4, and chroma moist from 4 through 6.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent."
