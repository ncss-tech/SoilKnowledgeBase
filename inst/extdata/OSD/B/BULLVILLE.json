Durst and Sapkin soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Fergie and Sattley soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Fraval soils are not dominated by fine gravel in the particle-size control section and have paralithic materials that are weathered tuff or andesite in the series control section.  Mulshoe soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section and have paralithic materials that are weathered basalt in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bullville soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,310 to 2,930 meters.  The climate is dry-subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
