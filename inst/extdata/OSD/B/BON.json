    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically the depth to carbonates ranges from 6 to 20 inches, but some pedons contain carbonates throughout. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 50 inches or more. The control section is loam, clay loam or silt loam and typically averages between 20 and 30 percent clay.  Buried A horizons are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam but is very fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam or silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam. Stratified fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam are in some pedons.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is stratified loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam with layers of loamy fine sand, silt loam, silty clay loam and clay loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Faint or distinct mottles are below depths of 30 inches in some pedons."

Draper and Pack soils are saturated with water within depths of 40 inches. Humbarger soils are stratified in the upper 20 to 30 inches and have a warmer soil temperature. The Lynx, Manzano, Shanta, and St. Onge soils have a drier soil moisture control section.  In addition, the Lynx soils do not have carbonates.  Maskell and Merrick soils do not have carbonates within depths of 40 inches. Umbarg soils have a consistent soil moisture control section."

Bon soils formed in calcareous stratified alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation from 17 to 26 inches and most occurs from April to September."
