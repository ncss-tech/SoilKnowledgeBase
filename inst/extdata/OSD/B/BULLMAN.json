Neotsu soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches, but are derived from basalt, and have up to 20 percent cobbles in the control section. Neskowin soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches deep, are derived from basalt, and have up to 15 percent cobbles in the control section.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bullman soils occur on summits and shoulders of hills and mountains at elevations of sea level to 1,200 feet. Slopes are 10 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from bedrock of siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate lithologies. The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 90 to 120 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 220 days."
