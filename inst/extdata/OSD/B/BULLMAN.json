  "OVERVIEW": "The Bullman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from bedrock of siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate lithologies. Bullman soils are on summits and shoulders of hills and mountains. Slopes are 10 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
