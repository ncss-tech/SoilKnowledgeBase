  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates is less than 10 inches.  The 10- to 40- inch control section is mainly strata of loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.  One or more very thin layers of very fine sand, loam or finer materials are in most pedons; others contain thin layers of coarse sand and gravel.  Some pedons have thin Ab horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Values of 2 or 3 moist are allowed if it is 3 inches or less in thickness or if it is 5 inches or less in thickness and has textures of loamy fine sand or coarser.  Textures range from sand to silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have AC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Banks soils are on level to gently sloping levees, flood plains and low terraces of larger streams.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Most areas have microtopographic small ridges, hummocks and hollows created by action of wind or floodwaters.  The soils formed in recently deposited sandy alluvium.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Havrelon, Lallie, Lohler and Trembles soils.  These soils commonly are on the more level floodplains farther from the stream channels.  Havrelon soils are fine-loamy and Lallie and Lohler soils are fine.  Trembles soils are coarse-loamy.  In some areas, the land type, riverwash, is between the Banks soils and the stream channel."
