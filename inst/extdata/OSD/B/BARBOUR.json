  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 40 inches. Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35  percent in the solum and from 0 to 60 in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and  chroma of 2 through 4. Dry color values are 6 or more.  It is fine sandy loam through silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular and consistence is very friable or friable. Some pedons have a thin black A horizon and a thin dark reddish brown Bhs horizon where unplowed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam, in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is prismatic, subangular blocky, or granular and consistence is very friable or friable. Some pedons have a sandy loam BC or Bw horizon less than 5 inches thick. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from loamy fine sand through sand in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive or single grain. Some pedons have a C horizon that is similar to the Bw in color and texture, but  has prismatic or platy structure. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. The Basher, Comus, Hamlin, Hamplain, Linden, Northbend(T), Occum, Otego, Philo, Pootatuck, Pope, Tioga, Waitsfield, Weider, and Wenonah are similar soils in related families. The Northbend(T) soils have redox features within 24 inches. None of the other soils above have contrasting particle size control sections. In addition, Basher, Philo, Pootatuck, Otego, Waitsfield, and Weider soils also have redox featurees within 24 inches. Hamlin and Tioga soils have more than 60 percent base saturation within 30 inches and are not as red; Comus, Hamplain, Occum, Otego, Philo, Pope, Pootatuck, Waitsfield, Wieder, and Wenonah soils are, also, not as red."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barbour soils are on convex or plane flood plains, alluvial fans, and low terraces. They formed in alluvium from areas of reddish sandstone, siltstone, and shale in both glaciated and residual areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 45 inches; mean frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The moderately well drained Basher soils, the somewhat poorly drained Bash, and the very poorly drained Wayland and Wyalusing soils are associated in a drainage  sequence. The loamy-skeletal, well drained Trestle and moderately well drained Deposit soils are also closely associated with Barbour soils on higher gradient floodplains. Lackawanna or Neckesville soils and their wetter associates are on adjacent till-covered uplands. Leckkill, Calvin, and Klinesville soils are associated in non-glaciated areas. Birdsboro, Raritan,  Tunkhannock, and Wyoming soils are on associated glacial outwash and stream terraces."
