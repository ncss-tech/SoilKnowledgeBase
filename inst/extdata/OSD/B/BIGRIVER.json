  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bigriver soils occur on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are 0 to 228 meters (0 to 745 feet). They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature. Mean annual precipitation is 1150 to 2000 millimeters (45 to 79 inches) but ranges to 2300 millimeters (90 inches) in the southern Oregon coast. Mean January temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F.); mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F.); and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days but ranges to 270 in the southern Oregon coast."

Fluvent feature - Irregular organic carbon distribution - the zone from 15 to 160 centimeters (Ab, C, A'b, C', A''b1, A''b2, C''1 & C''2 horizons)\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters, averages 12 percent clay, and 32.3 percent fine sand or coarser, by weight, and 0 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.90.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The assignment of cation-exchange activity class is inferred from a similar pedon in Redwood National Park, 86-RNP-21 and lab data from the Russ soils.
