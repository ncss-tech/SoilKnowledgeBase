  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bearhat soils are on alluvial fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of volcanic ash. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 2,100 to 2,400 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
