  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearhat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in local alluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of volcanic ash. Bearhat soils are on alluvial fan remnants. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
