The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 30 degrees to 33 degrees F.\nThe soil between depths of 6 and 18 inches is usually dry in all parts from June to November unless irrigated and is moist the rest of the year.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is stratified silt loam, silty clay loam and very fine sandy loam, with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 30 percent and averages more than 18 percent.  Clay content typically ranges from 18 to 25 percent.  Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth.  Reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline.  E.C. varies from 0.5 to 4.0 mmhos and SAR varies from 0 to 7.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2 or 5Y 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2; 2.5Y 4/2, 3/2 or 5/Y 3/2.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3; 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2, 6/4 or 5Y 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2, 3/2 or 5Y 2.5/2."
