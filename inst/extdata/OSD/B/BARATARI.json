  "OVERVIEW": "The Baratari series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately to moderately rapid permeable soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  These soils are on level to nearly level terraces of the lower Coastal Plain.  The water table is within 10 inches of the soil surface for about 1 to 6 months in most years.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Similar series in other families are the Echaw, Leon, Lynn Haven, Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, Ridgeland, Rimini, Rosedhu, Seagate, and Seewee series.  Echaw, Leon, Lynn Haven, Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, Rimini, and Seagate soils have siliceous mineralogy.  In addition, the depth to the upper boundary of the spodic horizons in Echaw and Rimini soils is at depths of 30 inches or more.  Lynn Haven and Rosedhu soils have Ap or A horizons more than 10 inches thick with color values less than 3.5.  Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, and Seagate soils have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizons.  Ridgeland soils do not have distinct albic horizons. Seewee soils have a subhorizon in the E horizon with chroma of 3 or more."
