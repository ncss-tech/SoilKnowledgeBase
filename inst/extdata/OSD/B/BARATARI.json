It is extremely acid to strongly acid to a depth of about 20 inches and very strongly acid below this depth.  The Bh horizon is within 30 inches of the surface.  Some pedons do not have a E' and B'h horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 or 1.  When dry, this horizon has a salt-and-pepper appearance.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 0 to 2.  The E horizon of some pedons has mottles of higher chroma and vertical black or dark gray streaks.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4.  Vertical or horizontal tongues or pockets of grayish sand are in the Bh horizon of some pedons.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Fragments of the overlying Bh materials are in this horizon in some pedons.\nThe B'h horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4.  Vertical or horizontal tongues or pockets of grayish sand are in the B'h horizon of some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 4."

Similar series in other families are the Echaw, Leon, Lynn Haven, Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, Ridgeland, Rimini, Rosedhu, Seagate, and Seewee series.  Echaw, Leon, Lynn Haven, Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, Rimini, and Seagate soils have siliceous mineralogy.  In addition, the depth to the upper boundary of the spodic horizons in Echaw and Rimini soils is at depths of 30 inches or more.  Lynn Haven and Rosedhu soils have Ap or A horizons more than 10 inches thick with color values less than 3.5.  Mascotte, Olustee, Onslow, and Seagate soils have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizons.  Ridgeland soils do not have distinct albic horizons. Seewee soils have a subhorizon in the E horizon with chroma of 3 or more."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Baratari soils are on level to nearly level areas on the Pamlico Terrace of the lower Coastal Plains.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  The average annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., average annual rainfall ranges from 48 to 52 inches, and the frost free season ranges from 250 to 290 days.  Average January air temperature is about 51 degrees F., and July is about 81 degrees F."

Fripp, Kiawah, Polawana, Seabrook, Wando, and Yemassee soils do not have a Bh horizon.  In addition, Kiawah soils contain dark brown concretions; Polawana soils have a surface layer 10 to 24 inches thick with color value of 2 or 3; and Yemassee soils have a Bt horizon."

Permeability is rapid in the A and E horizons and moderate to moderately rapid in the Bh horizons.  The water table is at depths of less than 10 inches for 1 to 6 months in most years and within depths of 60 inches most of the year."
