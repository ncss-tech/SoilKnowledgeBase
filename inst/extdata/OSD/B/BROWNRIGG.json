  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownrigg series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium on pediments and hillslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days.",
