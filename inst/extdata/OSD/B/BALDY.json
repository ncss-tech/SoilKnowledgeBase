  "OVERVIEW": "The Baldy series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapid to rapid permeable soils formed in materials from rhyolite and andesite with some influence from basalt and ash on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.",

The regolith consists of medium and moderately coarse-textured materials from rhyolite and andesite with some influence from basalt and ash. These soils occur at elevations of 9,000 to 11,500 feet in a sub-alpine climate. The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 degrees F. to 45 degrees F. and the frost-free season ranges from 70 to 85 days."
