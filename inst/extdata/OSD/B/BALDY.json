    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Baldy soils occur on 8 percent undulating to 65 percent steep mountain slopes. The regolith consists of medium and moderately coarse-textured materials from rhyolite and andesite with some influence from basalt and ash. These soils occur at elevations of 9,000 to 11,500 feet in a sub-alpine climate. The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 degrees F. to 45 degrees F. and the frost-free season ranges from 70 to 85 days."
