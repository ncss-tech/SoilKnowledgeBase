  "OVERVIEW": "The Beenom series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from sandstone or in alluvial or colluvial materials over the sandstone.  They are on bedrock floored plains, hills, structural benches, and strath terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
