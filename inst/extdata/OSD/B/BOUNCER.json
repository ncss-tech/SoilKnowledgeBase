  "OVERVIEW": "The Bouncer series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Bouncer soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Alcan, Armoine and Zyzzi soils are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel and lack hard bedrock within 76 cm.  Berit, Entero, Ravenell and Stodick soils have more than 25 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Flex and Sedsked soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days between July and October due to convection storms. Ginex soils have a calcareous, mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline control section.  Harvan soils have densic materials at 30 to 50 cm. Penelas soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments in the control section. Soar soils have rock fragments that are mainly 2 to 5 mm granitic gravel."
