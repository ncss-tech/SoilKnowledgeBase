  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches in thickness and extends into the Bw horizon.  The control section typically is silt loam with between 18 and 27 percent clay. The depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 16 to about 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Few or common nests of gypsum and other salts are visible in the lower part of the Bk horizon in most pedons.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and typically is varved with very thin strata of very fine sand, to clay.  Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness.  Few or common nests of gypsum or other salts are visible in the C horizon of some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Few to many, faint or distinct redox features are in the lower part of the C horizon in most pedons. Sand and gravel are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  Other pedons may have loamy glacial till below a depth of 40 inches."

Brookings and Tara soils have loam or clay loam within depths of 40 inches. Overly soils contain more than 27 percent clay in the series control section.  Waubay soils formed have mottles within depths of 40 inches.  Athelwold and Estelline soils have sand and gravel within depths of 40 inches.  Gardena soils are coarse-silty.  Grassna soils have a drier soil moisture control section for longer periods.  Great Bend soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  LaDelle soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.  Sinai soils have a fine textured control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beotia soils are on nearly level to gently sloping lake plains having plane and convex surfaces.  Slope gradients typically are less than 4 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in varved silty glaciolacustrine deposits with thin lenses of very fine sand to clay sized particles.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation from 16 to 24 inches, and P-E indices from 38 to 50.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer.  Growing season is about 120 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

The Aberdeen, Exline, Harmony, and Nahon soils have a fine textured series control section and are on the broad smooth flats.  In addition, Aberdeen, Nahon, and Exline soils have a natric horizon, and Harmony soils have an argillic horizon.  Great Bend soils are slightly higher on the landscape than the Beotia soils.  The poorly drained Tonka soils have an ablic horizon and are in closed depressions.  The somewhat poorly drained Winship soils have an argillic horizon and are in narrow shallow drainageways.  Zell soils are coarse-silty and are on higher parts of the landscape mostly on steep valley sides bordering streams crossing the lake plain."
