These soils formed in material commonly weathered from shale of the Kreyenhagen formation. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches. Mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 81 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.
