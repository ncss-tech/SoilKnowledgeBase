  "OVERVIEW": "The Belgarra series consists of very deep, well drained soils with high concentrations of gypsum in the subsoil, on erosional fan remnants on mountains. These soils formed in material weathered from shale. Slope is 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
