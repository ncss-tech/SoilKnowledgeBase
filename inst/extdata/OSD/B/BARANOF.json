  "OVERVIEW": "The Baranof series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. Baranof soils are on alluvial fans and footslopes.  Slopes range from 6 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is in excess of 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
