Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent gravel in the control section.  Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nAn Oe horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue ranging from 5YR to 10YR, value moist from 4 to 6, and chroma moist from 1 to 4.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR, value moist of 2 or 3, and chroma moist from 1 to 4. 2Bhs horizons, when present, commonly have texture of loamy sand or sand with thin stratas of silt loam and sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 75 percent gravel and cobble.
