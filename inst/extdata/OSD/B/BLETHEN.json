The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F.  Rock fragments in the control section average 35 to 70 percent by volume.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  Moist value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. The fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  This horizon has 25 to 60 percent rock fragments in the upper part and 40 to 70 percent in the lower part.  Cobbles range from 5 to 20 percent throughout.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist or dry.  The fine earth fraction is sandy loam or loam above 40 inches and sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand below 40 inches.  This horizon contains 40 to 70 percent pebbles, 5 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones by volume."

Heisler soils have more than 35 percent phyllite fragments in the control section.  Kanaskat soils have a volcanic ash mantle 7 to 12 inches thick.  Kickerville and Lyre soils have an extremely gravelly sand 2C horizon in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Swinomish and Vanzandt soils have a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 20 to 40 inches.  Tunnel soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the spodic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blethen soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes, toeslopes, and drift plain escarpments at 200 to 1,800 feet elevation.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from glacial drift, argillite, breccia, sandstone, and conglomerate with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Source rock for the glacial drift is dominantly andesitic and granitic.  The climate is marine influenced with cool, wet winters and relatively cool, dry summers. Average annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches.  The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees) is 140 to 180 days."

Barneston and Skykomish soils are sandy-skeletal. Cathcart and Squalicum soils are coarse-loamy.  Klaus soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have spodic horizons.  Littlejohn, Oakes, Pitcher, and Skykomish soils are frigid.  In addition, Littlejohn soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Nati soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone.  Tokul soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a duripan.  Winston soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  Andic soil materials recognized at 0 to 42 inches.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 5 inches and a spodic horizon from 5 to 24 inches.  The spodic horizon is assumed not to meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but is assumed to meet micromorphological criteria, i.e. silt-sized pellets and cracked coatings.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
