  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weathered sandstone or shale is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is between 59 degrees and 69 degrees F, and the soil temperature is always above 41 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 6 and 17 inches is dry in all parts from June to October or November and is moist in all parts from December to April.  Pebbles make up 2 to 15 percent. Coarse and very coarse sand make up less than 10 percent of the profile.  The soil commonly increases in acidity as depth increases and is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 7/1, 6/2, 6/3, 7/3 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  In some pedons the top one or two inches is 10YR 5/2, 5/3.  This horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The pedons with silt loam are commonly underlain by shale, and the pedons with sandy loam are commonly underlain by sandstone.  The surface 10 inches has 0.5 to 2.8 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 10YR 7/4, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 5/6; 2.5Y 4/4 or 7.5YR 6/6.  Moist color are 10YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6.  In some pedons, faces of peds are 10YR 7/3, 7/4, 8/3 or 8/2.  This horizon is clay loam or silty clay loam, and has 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has prismatic or subangular blocky structure.  It has more than 75 percent base saturation.\nThe upper part of the weathered sandstone or shale commonly is moderately or slightly acid but within 30 inches in some pedons the reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline and is with or without seams of lime."

Arbuckle, Borden, Esparto, Montpellier, Pomo, Ramona, Snelling, Wasioja, and Wyman soils lack a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Blasingame soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the B2t horizon.  Fallbrook soils have a paralithic contact at depth greater than 40 inches and have B2t horizons with 5YR hue.  Sesame and Tivy soils have value of 4 or 5 in the A horizon and have 12 to 22 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the control section."
