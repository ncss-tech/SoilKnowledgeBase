  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bunkum soils are on dissected till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. These soils formed in loess or in loess and the underlying silty water-worked sediments (pedisediment) overlying a paleosol. Mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual soil temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C (56 to 59 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is 914 to 1016 mm (36 to 40 inches). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 107 to 244 meters (350 to 800 feet) above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Atlas and Grantfork soils and well drained Ursa soils formed in till that contains a strongly developed paleosol and are on backslopes and footslopes downslope from the Bunkum soils. Also, the Grantfork soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. The somewhat poorly drained Coulterville soils are on summits and in upland drainageways nearby and contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. The somewhat poorly drained Darmstadt and Marine soils are on summits above the Bunkum soils. Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon. The fine-textured Marine soils have an abrupt textural change. The moderately well drained Homen and well drained Ruma soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes above the Bunkum soils."
