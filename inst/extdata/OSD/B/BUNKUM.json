  "OVERVIEW": "The Bunkum series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on dissected till plains. They formed in loess, or in loess and the underlying silty water-worked sediments (pedisediment). Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

Also, the Grantfork soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. The somewhat poorly drained Coulterville soils are on summits and in upland drainageways nearby and contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. The somewhat poorly drained Darmstadt and Marine soils are on summits above the Bunkum soils. Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon. The fine-textured Marine soils have an abrupt textural change. The moderately well drained Homen and well drained Ruma soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes above the Bunkum soils."
