  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Belmear series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in materials weathered from shale.  Belmear soils are on hillsides, ridges, and narrow valleys among shale hills and have slopes of 2 to 45 percent of more.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches, but does not exceed one-half the thickness of the mollic epipedon.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Continuous horizons of calcium carbonate do not occur with the control section although some visible accumulation may occur at any depth.  Rock fragments range from 0 to about 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4.5 through 5.5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is normally heavy silty clay loam or silty clay but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 25 to 60 percent, and sand from 5 to 35 percent.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kildore and Shrine series.  Kildore soils have a cryic temperature regime, a cambic horizon, and have continuous genetic horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Shrine soils have a fine-loamy control section and have no bedrock above depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Belmear soils are on gently to steep sloping ridges and hillsides.  Slopes range from about 2 to 45 percent.  The soil formed in moderately thin, calcareous, fine textured material weathered residually or locally transported from clay shale.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 61 degrees F."
