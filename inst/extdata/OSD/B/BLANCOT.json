  "OVERVIEW": "The Blancot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and fan alluvium from shale and sandstone. Blancot soils are on valley sides and ridges. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Balon and Decolney soils are noncalcareous throughout. Bowbac, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest, Pokeman, Pugsley and Spangler soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at moderate depths.  Buckle, Doakum, Oelop, Penistaja, and Quagwa soils have Bk horizons in the lower part of the profile.   Mentmore soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate and gypsum. Oelop, Palacid, Penistaja and Redpen soils have hue redder than 10YR. Sundance soils have buried paleosol horizons.  Teckla soils contain 35 to 70 percent porcelanite rock fragments below a 20 to 40 inch depth.  Fort and Yenlo soils have Ck horizons in the lower part of the profile.  In addition, the Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Decolney, Forkwood, Fort, Hagerman, Hiland, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance, Tekla and Yenlo series are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."
