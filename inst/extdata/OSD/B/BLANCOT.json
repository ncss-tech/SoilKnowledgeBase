Balon and Decolney soils are noncalcareous throughout. Bowbac, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest, Pokeman, Pugsley and Spangler soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at moderate depths.  Buckle, Doakum, Oelop, Penistaja, and Quagwa soils have Bk horizons in the lower part of the profile.   Mentmore soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate and gypsum. Oelop, Palacid, Penistaja and Redpen soils have hue redder than 10YR. Sundance soils have buried paleosol horizons.  Teckla soils contain 35 to 70 percent porcelanite rock fragments below a 20 to 40 inch depth.  Fort and Yenlo soils have Ck horizons in the lower part of the profile.  In addition, the Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Decolney, Forkwood, Fort, Hagerman, Hiland, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance, Tekla and Yenlo series are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blancot soils are on valley sides and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. They formed in moderately fine-textured alluvium and fan alluvium from shale and sandstone. Elevations are 5,600 to 7,000 feet. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 13 inches, however a few areas are as low as 8 or 9 inches; mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 100 to 140 days."
