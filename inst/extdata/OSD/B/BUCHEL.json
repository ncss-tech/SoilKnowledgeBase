  "OVERVIEW": "The Buchel series consists of very deep, very slowly permeable, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium of recent age. These soils occur on nearly level flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
