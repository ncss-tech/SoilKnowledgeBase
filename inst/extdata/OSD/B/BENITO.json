  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 72 inches.  These soils, when dry, have cracks 0.4 inch to 3.0\ninches in width to depths of 20 inches. Slickensides begin at 10 to 20 inches below the surface; parallelepipedsare titled 30 to 60 degrees from the horizontaland part to moderate very fine and medium angular blockystructure. Soil salinity increases with depth and ranges from 4to 20 dS/m in the 10- to 40-inch control section.\nExchangeable sodium increases with depth and exceeds 15 percent\nin some part of the upper 30 inches of soil.\nThe A and AC horizons are gray (N 5/0; 10YR 5/1) or light gray (N 6/0; 10YR6/1). Moist values are more than 3.5. Chroma of less\nthan 1.5 extends to depths of 40 inches or more. Below 40 inches chromasare 2 in some pedons. The 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 60 to78 percent clay. Sand content is less than 4 percent, and the norm is about2 percent.\nThe 2C horizon is pale brown (10YR 6/3), grayish brown (10YR\n5/2), light gray (10YR 6/1), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).\nIt is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam. In some pedons a 3C horizon that is loamy fine sand or\nfine sand occurs below 60 inches."

Harlengen soils have chroma of 2 or 3 in the upper 40 inches.  Lomalta soils have prismatic structure in the upper part of the control section. In addition, they have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout. Mercedes and Montell soils have less than 60 percent clay and the control section. Monteola, Tiocano, and Victoria soils have A horizons with color values less than 3.5 when moist and 5.5 when dry."
