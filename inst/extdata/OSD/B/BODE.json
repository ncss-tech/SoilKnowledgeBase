  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically the thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 50 inches thick.  Depth to free carbonates typically is the same as thickness of the solum.  The average content of clay in the moderately fine textured sediments is about 32 to 36 percent, and the average content of sand is about 20 to 30 percent.  Typically, pebbles are rare or are lacking.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 28 and 35 percent clay and from 25 to 45 percent sand.\nThe A or Ap horizons have 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The AB horizon, if present, has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3.  The A horizon typically is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It typically is free of mottles to 30 inches or more.  Mottles below this are few or common with colors like those of the 2C horizon.  The Bw horizon is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon commonly has a mottled matrix having colors of 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is loam or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arbor, Aredale, Clarion, Cresken, Everly, Farrar, Frontenac, Garmore, Kenyon, Liscomb, Moland, Ocheyedan, Ostrander, and Rossfield soils.  Arbor soils are on foot slopes and formed in loamy local alluvium or colluvium and the underlying firm, clay loam glacial till.  They are more acid and are leached of carbonates to greater depths.  Aredale soils are more acid and have a thicker solum.  Clarion and Cresken soils have less clay and more sand in the A horizon.  Everly soils tend to have somewhat higher silt and lower sand content in the upper part of the solum and are underlain by firm, calcareous glacial till of loam or clay loam texture.  Farrar soils have more sand and less clay in the A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon.  Frontenac soils have 35 percent or more coarse fragments in the lower part of the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Garmore soils are more acid and typically have a thicker solum.  Kenyon and Ostrander soils have a more acid B horizon, are leached to greater depths, and have less clay in the solum.  Liscomb soils are more acid throughout the solum and have less clay in the control section.  Moland soils formed in 14 to 24 inches of loess or loess-like sediments and the underlying glacial till.  Ocheyedan soils formed in loamy glacial sediments that contain few or no pebbles and are stratified in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon in most pedons.  Rossfield soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy sediments over residuum weathered from arenaceous limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bode soils typically are on convex slopes in the relatively undissected, gently undulating to rolling Late Wisconsin till plain.  Much of the Bode soils have slopes of 2 to 5 percent.  The rest range to about 18 percent.  The soils formed in glacial or lacustrine sediments that overlie calcareous glacial till of loam texture.  Slopes are longer and smoother than on typical till plains.  Relief is low, and the knobs of well drained soils are less prominent than on till plains not mantled by sediments.  Soils in depressions make up only 1 or 2 percent of the total area instead of 5 to 15 percent as in typical till plains.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 32 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Clarion soils and the Kossuth, Nicollet, Ottosen, Storden, and Webster soils.  Clarion, Nicollet and Webster soils form a drainage sequence associated with the Bode, Ottosen, and Kossuth soils.  They have less clay than these soils.  Kossuth and Ottosen soils form a drainage sequence with Bode soils in undulating to gently rolling landscapes.  Storden soils are associated in rolling or hilly landscapes and are on the steeper or more strongly convex slopes.  Storden soils lack cambic horizons that are free of carbonates."
