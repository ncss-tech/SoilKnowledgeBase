  "OVERVIEW": "The Bock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Bock soils are on terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
