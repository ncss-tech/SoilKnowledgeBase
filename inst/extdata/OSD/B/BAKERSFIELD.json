Elevations are 280 to 680 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."

Milagro soils are on similar landforms and have an ochric epipedon.  Panoche soils are on adjacent low alluvial fans, are fine-loamy, and have a regular decrease in organic matter.  Weedpatch soils are on adjacent relic basin floors and have a calcic horizon."
