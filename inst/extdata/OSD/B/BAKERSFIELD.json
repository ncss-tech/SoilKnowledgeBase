  "OVERVIEW": "The Bakersfield series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stream alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock.  Many areas of this soil are artificially drained.  Bakersfield soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
