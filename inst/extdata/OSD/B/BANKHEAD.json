Coarse fragments, mostly sandstone channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 25 percent in the surface layer and up to 35 percent in the subsoil.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout, except for surface layers that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Thickness is 5 inches or less. Fine-earth texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Fine-earth texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe R layer consists of hard, level bedded to slightly tilted, sandstone with fine-earth filling narrow fractures where present."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Gorgas, Hartsells, Hector, Linker, Nauvoo, Pirum, and Sipsey series are in similar families. Gorgas and Hector soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches and Hector soil has an argillic horizon and is in a loamy family. Hartsells, Linker, Nauvoo, Pirum, and Sipsey soils have argillic horizons and are in fine-loamy families. The Nauvoo series is greater than 40 inches deep to paralithic contact with soft sandstone."

Allen and Leesburg soils have sola greater than 60 inches and are on colluvial positions. Apison, Hartsells, Nauvoo, and Sipsey soils are on ridgetops and upper side slopes and are in a fine-loamy family. Gorgas and Mountainburg soils are on side slopes usually associated with sandstone rock outcrop and are in lithic families. Sunlight and Tidings soils formed in residuum weathered from siltstone and fine-grained sandstone and occupy on similar positions on the landscape. Sunlight soils are in a loamy-skeletal family and Tidings soils are in a fine-loamy family. Townley soils are on less sloping side slopes and are in a fine family."
