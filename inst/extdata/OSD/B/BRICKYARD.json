  "REVDATE": "10/2018",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brickyard series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on forested flood plains of major rivers.  They formed in silty and clayey alluvial sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 69 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 8 to 48 inches but is typically 15 to 32 inches thick.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral in the A and Bg horizons, and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Cg horizon.  Few to many flakes of mica range from none to common.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, clay, or their mucky analogs.\nThe Bg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where this soil has colors with chroma higher than 2, they extend to depth of less than 20 inches.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5B, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2; or is neutral with value of 3 to 7.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, clay, or their mucky analogs.  Below 40 inches the Cg horizon may contain organic strata.  Below 60 inches it may contain strata with textures ranging from loamy sand to sandy clay."

The poorly drained Chowan soils are on similar positions but have mineral layers more than 20 inches in thickness over organic material.  Kenner soils are in fresh water marshes and have organic layers throughout.  The poorly drained Meggett soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have argillic horizons."
