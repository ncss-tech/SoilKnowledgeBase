  "OVERVIEW": "The Brinegar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained\nsoils on alluvial fans and terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium\nfrom acid and basic igneous, and some sedimentary rocks.  Permeability\nis moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average\nannual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air\ntemperature is about 41 degrees F.",
