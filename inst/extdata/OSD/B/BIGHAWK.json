  "REVDATE": "10/2013",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bighawk series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from pyroclastics and cinders. Bighawk soils are on alluvial fans, and plateaus. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F. (11.1 degress C.)",
