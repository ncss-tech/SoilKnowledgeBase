These soils formed in alluvium  derived from cinders. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches (254 to 356 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains and snowfall during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit (10.0 to 12.2 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 135 to 165 days."
