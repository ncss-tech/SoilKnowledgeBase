  "OVERVIEW": "The Broadmoor series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in materials weathered from granite.  Broadmoor soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Rock fragments in the control section range from 35 to 80 percent by volume and are mostly 5 to 40 mm in diameter.  The fine earth fraction of the control section ranges in clay from 10 to 25 percent.  The profile has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6."
