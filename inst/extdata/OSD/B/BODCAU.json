The Abita, Beauregard, Frizzel, Glenmora, Gurdon, Keithville, Kolin, Sawtown and Timpson series are in closely related families.  Beauregard soils have more than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and have more than 5 percent plinthite segregations in the subsoil.  Frizzell soils have a clay decrease of 20 percent or more from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches and have base saturation more than 35 percent in the lower part of the solum. Gurdon soils have a subsoil layer with more than 10 percent brittle peds, do not have a lithologic discontinuity, and have a semiactive activity class.  Abita, Glenmora, Keithville, Kolin and Sawtown soils have a more than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and have base saturation more than 35 percent in the lower part of the solum.

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 48 inches.  Frost free days range from 250 to 275.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 245 feet."
