    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. The Abita, Beauregard, Frizzel, Glenmora, Gurdon, Keithville, Kolin, Sawtown and Timpson series are in closely related families.  Beauregard soils have more than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and have more than 5 percent plinthite segregations in the subsoil.  Frizzell soils have a clay decrease of 20 percent or more from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches and have base saturation more than 35 percent in the lower part of the solum. Gurdon soils have a subsoil layer with more than 10 percent brittle peds, do not have a lithologic discontinuity, and have a semiactive activity class.  Abita, Glenmora, Keithville, Kolin and Sawtown soils have a more than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and have base saturation more than 35 percent in the lower part of the solum.  Timpson soils have base saturation more than 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and are better drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bodcau soils are on broad, level to very gently sloping positions on stream terraces.  They formed in  Pleistocene age silty alluvial sediments derived from acid soils on tertiary uplands. The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F. at the type location.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 48 inches.  Frost free days range from 250 to 275.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 245 feet."

Kolin soils are on similar positions and have a clayey discontinuity within a depth of 36 inches.  Bowie soils are on higher positions, formed in Tertiary age marine sediments, and contain more than 5 percent plinthite.  Gore soils are on sideslopes along drainageways and are clayey throughout.  Guyton and Wrightsville soils are in depressional areas and are gray throughout with aquic conditions in the upper part of the subsoil."

A saturated zone with its upper boundary at 1 to 2.5 feet is perched above the discontinuity during the winter and early spring months in normal years. Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is low on the more level slopes, and medium on gently sloping areas."
