  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise noted the entire range of properties permissible for the subgroup and family in which the series has been placed applies to the series as well.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye) in a majority of subhorizons within the control section.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Weighted average gypsum content of the control section ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent within the control section except that subhorizons totaling less than 4 inches in thickness that exceed those limits may occur inconsistently in some pedons.  Continuous subhorizons of concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate should not occur inconsistently at any depth or may occur uniformly throughout the control section in some pedons.  Weighted average content of clay in the control section ranges from 5 to 18 percent and the weighted average content of fine or coarser sand ranges from 35 to 85 percent.  Coarse fragments ranging from 1 to 10 inches in diameter predominate.  Hue ranges from 5Y to 7.5YR except that a few subhorizons having hue redder than 7.5YR may occur discontinuously and occupy less than half the thickness of the control section in some pedons.  Mottling within the control section not due to segregated lime may range from no mottling to weak mottling of low contrast, but if the soil is consistently mottled the base chroma of the matrix material must be more than 2.  The control section should be uniform with only minor stratification."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Barrett series occurs on moderate to very steeply sloping upland hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  The soils are developing in thin deposits of materials weathered residually or only locally transported from peds of interbedded soft sandstone and loamstone of the Browns Park formation.  Slopes typically range from 2 to 40 or more percent.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and early summer months.  The average annual air temperature is 40 degrees F., the average summer air temperature is 59 degrees F., the mean annual soil temperature is 43 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 57 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Kimmons and Roxann series.  The Kimmons series differs in having a mollic epipedon, an argillic horizon, and in having no bedrock above 20 inches.  The Roxann series differs in having less than 35 percent gravel in the control section."
