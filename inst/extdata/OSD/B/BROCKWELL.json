  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness ranges from 60 to over 80 inches.  The amount of coarse fragments, dominantly sandstone, ranges from none to 35 percent throughout the profile.  Except where the soil has been limed, the reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have a 1 to 5 inch A1 horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam, and their gravelly phases.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam, and their gravelly phases.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, and commonly with iron accumulations in shades or red, brown, or yellow.  In some pedons, the clay films have similar hue and value but darker chroma than the matrix.  The lower Bt horizon is commonly variegated in shades or red or brown in the 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR hue. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, and their gravelly phases.\nThe BC and C horizons, if present, have similar color and texture as the Bt horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Brockwell is the only series in this family.  Series with common limits in definition are the Benndale, Brocket, Claiborne, Hartsells, Heidel, McLaurin, Nolichucky, and Trimble series.  Benndale, Heidel, and McLaurin soils are similar to Brockwell in texture, but are thermic.  In addition, McLaurin soils are redder and bisequal.  Brocket, Claiborne, Hartsells, Nolichucky, and Trimble soils are fine-loamy.  In addition, Claiborne soils have 5 to 25 percent fragments of chert in each horizon, Hartsells soils are thermic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brockwell soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep uplands in the Ozark Highlands.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from sandstone bedrock.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation near the type location is about 45 inches and mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F."

Boden, Doniphan, and Gassville soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, and on slightly lower nearby landscapes.  In addition, Doniphan and Gassville soils have chert fragments in each horizon.  Arkana soils have solums 20 to 45 inches thick and a very-fine control section.  Moko soils have solums 6 to 20 inches thick and loamy-skeletal control section.  Arkana and Moko soils are on lower ridges, sideslopes, and limestone benches.  Portia soils have more than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic and are on lower sideslopes."
