Birdcanyon, Bluepoint, Brazito, Cajon, Copia, Hembrillo, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Morongo, Pintura, Toquop, and Yturbide are very deep. Yander are deep to weathered granitoid bedrock. In addition, Bluepoint, Brazito, Cajon, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Moapa, Toquop, and Yturbide allow effervescence throughout the control section. Copia and Pintura have Hues of 7.5YR or redder. Maynard Lake also contains more than 20 percent pumice and volcanic ash. Brazito, Copia and Yturbide are intermittently moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days from July to September. Koehn soil do not receive substantial summer precipitation and are only intermittently moist near the soil surface following occasional summer convection storms. Also, Bluepoint, Copia, Hembrillo, Moapa and Pintura soils all formed in eolian deposits; Hembrillo soils are gypsiferous, while Pintura soils form in sandstone and Moapa soils are deposited over sandstone. Moapa soils also have a lithic contact below the paralithic contact from 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bigcanyon soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitoid or gneiss. Elevation ranges from 792 to 1,128 meters (2,600 to 3,700 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers, and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C (63 to 68 degrees F). The frost-free season is 270 to 320 days."

Arizo soils occur on stream terraces and have a sandy-skeletal particle size control section and are very deep. Ironped soils occur on convex spurs and are shallow to a paralithic contact. Morongo soils are formed in alluvium, are very deep and are found on footslopes. Smithcanyon soils are found on adjacent upper backslopes at higher elevations, are shallow to a paralithic contact and have a xeric bordering on aridic soil moisture regime. Whiterobe soils are on lower elevation, adjacent backslopes, have more than 35 percent rock fragments in part of the particle size control section, and have a hyperthermic temperature regime."
