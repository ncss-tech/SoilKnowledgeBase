Birdcanyon, Bluepoint, Brazito, Cajon, Copia, Hembrillo, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Morongo, Pintura, Toquop, and Yturbide are very deep. Yander are deep to weathered granitoid bedrock. In addition, Bluepoint, Brazito, Cajon, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Moapa, Toquop, and Yturbide allow effervescence throughout the control section. Copia and Pintura have Hues of 7.5YR or redder. Maynard Lake also contains more than 20 percent pumice and volcanic ash. Brazito, Copia and Yturbide are intermittently moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days from July to September. Koehn soil do not receive substantial summer precipitation and are only intermittently moist near the soil surface following occasional summer convection storms. Also, Bluepoint, Copia, Hembrillo, Moapa and Pintura soils all formed in eolian deposits; Hembrillo soils are gypsiferous, while Pintura soils form in sandstone and Moapa soils are deposited over sandstone. Moapa soils also have a lithic contact below the paralithic contact from 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 inches)."

Arizo soils occur on stream terraces and have a sandy-skeletal particle size control section and are very deep. Ironped soils occur on convex spurs and are shallow to a paralithic contact. Morongo soils are formed in alluvium, are very deep and are found on footslopes. Smithcanyon soils are found on adjacent upper backslopes at higher elevations, are shallow to a paralithic contact and have a xeric bordering on aridic soil moisture regime. Whiterobe soils are on lower elevation, adjacent backslopes, have more than 35 percent rock fragments in part of the particle size control section, and have a hyperthermic temperature regime."
