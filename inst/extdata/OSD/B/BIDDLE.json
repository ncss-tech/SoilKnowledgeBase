Mean annual temperature is 12.2 to 13.9 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 914 to 1016 millimeters (36 to 40 inches), frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 122 to 244 meters (400 to 800 feet) above sea level."

The moderately well drained Aviston soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes above the Biddle soils. The poorly drained Cowden, Fosterburg, Piasa, and Virden soils on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of the landform nearby. The Cowden and Virden soils do not have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. The Fosterburg soils have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil, and the Piasa soils have a natric horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Herrick and Oconee soils commonly are on similar landform positions. The Herrick soils do not have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. The Oconee soils do not have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil, do not have a mollic epipedon, and typically are nearer the drainageways."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers/sec) in the subsoil and in the substratum formed in loess. Permeability is slow. Surface runoff potential is low. In drained areas, depth to an intermittent perched high water table is 30 to 61 centimeters (1.0 foot to 2.0 feet) from January to May in most years."
