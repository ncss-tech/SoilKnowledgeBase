  "OVERVIEW": "The Biddle series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess, or in loess and the underlying silty pedisediment on nearly level parts of broad interfluves on till plains.

The somewhat poorly drained Herrick and Oconee soils commonly are on similar landform positions. The Herrick soils do not have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. The Oconee soils do not have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil, do not have a mollic epipedon, and typically are nearer the drainageways."
