  "OVERVIEW": "The Biddleman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine deposits. Biddleman soils are on beach terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
