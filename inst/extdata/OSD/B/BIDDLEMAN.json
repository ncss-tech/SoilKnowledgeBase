  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Biddleman soils are on beach terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1230 to 1335 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
