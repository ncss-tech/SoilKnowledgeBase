  "OVERVIEW": "The Beauregard series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age.   These soils are on broad, nearly level and gently sloping Coastal Plains.  They are saturated for short periods during winter and early spring.  Water runs off the surface at a medium to slow rate.  Slope is dominantly 1 to 3 percent but ranges from 0 to 5 percent.",
