Blevins and Malbis soils are on slightly higher convex ridge tops and side slopes.  Caddo and Guyton soils are poorly drained and have a gray subsoil.  Caddo soils are on broad flats at slightly higher elevations.  Guyton soils are on lower positions on depressions and along drainageways.  Messer soils are on convex mounds.  Messer soils have a coarse-silty control section."
