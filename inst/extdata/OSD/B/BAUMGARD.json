Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average from 10 to 35 percent and are dominantly pebbles and  cobbles.  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10 YR  and value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry. The fine earth fraction is clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or loam.   Pebbles and cobbles range from 5 to 25 percent in the upper part and from 15 to 50 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 15 inches, an argillic horizon from 15 to 46 inches, and a lithologic change from medial to fine-loamy at 15 inches.  This description reflects a change in classification based on amendment 16.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of less than 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of less than 5 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2 percent.  Bulk density is more than 0.90 g/cc below 14 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
