This description reflects a change in classification based on amendment 16.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of less than 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of less than 5 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2 percent.  Bulk density is more than 0.90 g/cc below 14 inches."
