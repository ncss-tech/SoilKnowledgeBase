  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Blackwell soils are on bottomlands, stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 3,800 to 9,000 feet and range from 9,100 to 10,600 feet in Colorado.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous and acid igneous rocks.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  Average annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F. The frost free season is 50 to 70 days."
