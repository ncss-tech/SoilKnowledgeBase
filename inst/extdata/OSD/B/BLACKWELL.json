  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackwell series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous and acid igneous rocks.  Blackwell soils are on bottomlands, stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
