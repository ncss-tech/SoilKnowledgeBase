These soils form in alluvium derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1520 to 1900 millimeters (60 to 75 inches). Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degree C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).
