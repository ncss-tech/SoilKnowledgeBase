  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigtree series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Bigtree soils are on gently sloping alluvial fans and low terraces and have slopes 2 to 9 percent. Surface runoff is at a negligible to low rate. The mean annual precipitation is 1780 millimeters (70 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
