The thickness of the upper loamy mantle ranges from 12 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral. In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has value of 6 or more when dry.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  It has 2 to 10 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma or 3 or 4.  The upper part is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  The lower part is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  Lamellae may occur with textures of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral.

Balmlake soils have 6 to 14 percent clay in the C horizon and have stratified textures of fine sand to silt loam. Bergkeller, Nadeau and Sugarbush soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  The Cunard soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  The Emmet, Flak, Heyder, Milaca, and Omena soils have textures finer than loamy sand below the argillic horizon and within the series control section.  The Millward soils are moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the control section. The Sanburn soils do not have free carbonates in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bootlake soils have plane or convex slopes on glacial outwash plains, valley trains and moraines.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 40 percent.  They formed in a thin mantle of loamy sediments underlain by sandy outwash sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 140. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."

The poorly drained Epoufette and Sahkahtay soils are on low-lying nearly level areas.  The somewhat excessively drained Graycalm and excessively drained Menahga soils do not have a mantle of loamy sediments.  The moderately well drained Karlstad soils are on lower lying positions.  The very poorly drained Markey, Rifle and Seelyeville soils are in depressions."
