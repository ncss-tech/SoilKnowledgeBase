  "OVERVIEW": "The Beartrap series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and alluvium from eolian material.  Beartrap soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderate throughout.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
