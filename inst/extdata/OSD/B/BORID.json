  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Borid soils are on south-facing hill shoulders and backslopes and canyon walls at elevations of 2,500 to 5,300 feet. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches. The average annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 155 days."
