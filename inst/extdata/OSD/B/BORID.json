  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Borid series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
