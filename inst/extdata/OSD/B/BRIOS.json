  "OVERVIEW": "The Brios series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in mixed and stratified alluvium.  Brios soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 73 degrees F.",
