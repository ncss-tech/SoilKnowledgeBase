  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bleiblerville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed from weakly consolidated calcareous clays and marls of Tertiary Age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1088 mm (43 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.4 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
