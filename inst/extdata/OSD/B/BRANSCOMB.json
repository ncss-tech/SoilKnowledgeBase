The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone.  A strong coastal fog influence limits the diurnal and annual ranges of temperature.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1500 mm.  Mean January temperature is 10 degrees C, mean July temperature is 13 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."
