  "REVDATE": "02/2017",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boondock series consists of very shallow soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Boondock soils are on rock pediments and hills. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
