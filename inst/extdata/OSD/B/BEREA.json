  "REVDATE": "06/2008",
  "STATES": "KY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Berea series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in a silty mantle overlying Devonian aged black shale residuum.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on broad ridgetops. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the upper solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the lower solum and substratum. Reaction ranges from strongly to extremely acid throughout the profile, except where limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. A thin A horizon that has similar hue, but value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, is present in wooded areas. Texture is silt loam or rarely silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray are common. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nA 2Btg or 2Cg horizon is present in some pedons with hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. In places, these horizons are variegated without dominant value or chroma. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay."

These soils formed in 18 to 36 inches of silty material overlying Devonian aged black shale residuum. Near the OSD site temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F. with a mean of about 55 degrees. Precipitation ranges from 36 to 50 inches annually with a mean of about 43 inches."

Beasley, Cruze, Muse, Shrouts, and Trappist soils have more than 35 percent clay in their particle-size control sections. Colyer and Rohan soils are 8 to 20 inches deep to bedrock. Tilsit soils have fragipans."
