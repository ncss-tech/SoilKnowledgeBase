  "OVERVIEW": "The Brezniak series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from igneous bedrock.  Brezniak soils are on side slopes of deeply dissected tablelands,mountain flanks and mountain footslopes.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The mean summer soil temperature is 63 to 65 degrees F.  The depth to bedrock is 7 to 12 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick, contains 1 to 2 percent organic matter and includes all or part of the argillic horizon.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  The lower boundary is abrupt or clear and there is a 15 to 23 percent (absolute) clay increase between the A and Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has a value of 4 through 6 dry, and 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay."

Cullius soils have 10 to 30 percent glass in the A horizon.  Devada soils are 12 to 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Deven soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock and have a xeric moisture regime.  Devnot soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Dunnlake soils are 12 to 20 inches to bedrock.  Wylo soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F."
