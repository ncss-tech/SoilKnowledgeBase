  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist in the winter and spring, and dry from July through October.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 63 to 65 degrees F.  The depth to bedrock is 7 to 12 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick, contains 1 to 2 percent organic matter and includes all or part of the argillic horizon.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  The lower boundary is abrupt or clear and there is a 15 to 23 percent (absolute) clay increase between the A and Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has a value of 4 through 6 dry, and 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay."

Bidrim soils have 3 to 8 percent organic matter in the A horizon, are 10 to 14 inches deep to bedrock and contain 55 to 65 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Cullius soils have 10 to 30 percent glass in the A horizon.  Devada soils are 12 to 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Deven soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock and have a xeric moisture regime.  Devnot soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Dunnlake soils are 12 to 20 inches to bedrock.  Wylo soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brezniak soils occur on side slopes of deeply dissected tablelands, mountain flanks and mountain footslopes.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from igneous rock.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  Elevation ranges from 3,600 to 6,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
