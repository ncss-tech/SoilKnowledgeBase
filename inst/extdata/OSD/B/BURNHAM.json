  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 33 to 50 cm. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm. The weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent throughout. Rock fragments are mainly channers and gravel with some cobbles and stones. Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam throughout the mineral soil. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout the soil except for the O and A horizons, where present, which range from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is muck or mucky peat. It has weak or moderate very fine to medium granular structure or it is massive.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2. It has granular structure or it is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is massive or has platy, granular or prismatic structure. Moist consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 2. It has platy, granular, subangular blocky or prismatic structure. Moist consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Cdg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y to 5GY, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 3. It has prismatic or platy structure, or it is massive. Moist consistence is firm or very firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Burnham soils are on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in dense glacial till derived mainly from slate and other dark colored sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1168 mm. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 37 to 671 meters above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bangor, Chesuncook, Dixmont, Elliottsville, Howland, Monarda, Monson, Penquis, Plaisted, Telos, Thorndike, Winnecook and Wonsqueak soils. The Bangor, Chesuncook, Dixmont, Howland, Plaisted and Telos soils are better drained soils at higher elevations in the landscape. Elliottsville, Monson, Penquis, Thorndike and Winnecook soils are better drained, shallower to bedrock soils at higher elevations in the landscape. Monarda soils are in a similar position as the Burnham soils, but are better drained and do not have a histic epipedon. Wonsqueak soils are in depressions and large concave areas and have thicker accumulations of organic matter."
