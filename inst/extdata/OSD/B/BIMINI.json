    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 35 to 75 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the A, E, and Bh horizons and from very strongly acid to neutral in the Bt horizon.  Reaction of the 2C horizon ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  This horizon is a mixture of loose coquina shell and fragments of shell and sand.  In some pedons, shell and sand are stratified."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cassia, Electra, Narcoossee, Newnan, Pomello, and Zolfo series in the same family.  Cassia, Narcoossee, and Newnan soils have spodic horizons within 30 inches of the surface.  In addition, Cassia soils are on slightly lower positions and do not have underlying argillic horizons, Narcoossee soils are on similar positions and do not have argillic horizons, and Newnan soils are on similar positions.  Electra soils are on similar positions but do not have gravel in the profile.  The somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained Pomello soils are on similar to higher positions and do not have argillic horizons below the Spodic horizon.  Zolfo soils have Spodic horizons below 50 inches and do not have argillic horizons below the Spodic horizon."

They formed in moderately thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

The well drained Bulow and Coca soils are on higher positions.  In addition, Bulow soils are deep to coquina bedrock and Cocoa soils are moderately deep to coquina bedrock.  The very poorly drained Pellicer and Turnbull soils are on lower tidal areas and have clayey subsoils and substratum, respectively.  The very poorly drained and poorly drained Wabasso soils are on lower flatwoods positions.  The well drained Welaka soils are on higher positions, are sandy throughout, and have poorly defined spodic horizons."
