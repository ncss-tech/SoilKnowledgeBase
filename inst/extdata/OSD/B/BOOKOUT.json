  "OVERVIEW": "The Bookout series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium. These soils occur on stream terraces on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).",
