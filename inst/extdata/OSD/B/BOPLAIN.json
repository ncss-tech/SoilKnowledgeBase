  "REVDATE": "09/2001",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boplain series consists of excessively drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone.  They formed in eolian sand and sandy outwash on valley trains.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy residuum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A horizon is sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in Ap horizons where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  The Bw horizons are sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand.  Bw horizons with spodic color have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 8.\nThe 2Cr and 2R horizons have colors like the 2C horizon described above."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boplain soils typically are on sand sheets that mantle valley trains.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in  20 to 40 inches of eolian sand and sandy outwash overlying sandstone.  Some pedons have the lower part of the solum or the substratum formed in sandy residuum from the underlying siliceous sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1000 feet."

The well drained Elevasil soils are on nearby hills and formed in a loamy eolian or slope alluvium mantle over siliceous sandy residuum and are underlain by sandstone bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Farrington soils, the moderately well drained Komro, and the excessively drained Plainfield and Finchford soils, formed in more than 60 inches of sandy outwash on nearby positions on valley trains."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas with slopes less than 6 percent are used for cropland.  Corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay are the principal crops.  Most of the steeper areas are used for woodland or pastureland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and pine forest.  Common trees are northern pin oak and jack pine."
