Deadmansridge and Goldmountain soils are on mountain sideslopes and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. In addition, Goldmountain soils have a lithic contact within 100 centimeters (40 inches). Doble, Moonridge and Shayroad soils have a mollic epipedon that is more than 50 centimeters (20 inches) thick. In addition Doble soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and Moonridge soils are on alluvial flats."
