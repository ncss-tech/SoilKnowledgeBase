  "OVERVIEW": "The Butterfield series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from quartzite, andesite, or sedimentary rock. The soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.\nThe mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Stones and cobble exceed 35 percent by volume throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is 7 to 20 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures include very cobbly clay loam, very cobbly sandy clay loam, and very cobbly silt loam. It contains less than 35 percent clay and has 35 to 80 percent cobble and stone by volume. This horizon has moderate to strong, fine to medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures include very cobbly sandy clay loam, very cobbly silt loam, very cobbly silty clay loam, and very cobbly clay loam. Rock fragments are 35 to 80 percent cobble and stone by volume. The lime accumulation is mainly as coatings on coarse fragments."
