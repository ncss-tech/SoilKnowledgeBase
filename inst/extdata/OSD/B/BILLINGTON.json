  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Billington soils are permanently submerged with salt or brackish water in mainland coves of coastal lagoons and bays. These soils are on slightly concave through level landforms. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. The soils formed in low bulk density silty estuarine sediments over freshwater or salt water organic materials in 10 through 200 cm of water."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Anguilla soils are on submerged mainland beaches and have a sandy particle-size class. Napatree soils are on submerged headlands, and submerged mainland beaches are sandy in the upper part, and lack sulfidic materials. Pishagqua soils are in low energy lagoon bottom landscapes and do not have organic horizons. The Fort Neck soils have an n-value of 0.7 or less in some horizon at a depth between 20 and 50 cm below the mineral soil surface. Wequetequock soils do not have an organic horizon within 100 cm of the soil surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 1.2 m of water at the time of coring).\n2. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 cm (Ase horizon).\n3. Sulfidic materials - the zone from 0 to 88 cm (Ase and Cse horizons).\n4. High n-value - the zone from 0 to 88 cm has an n-value greater than 0.7, as surmised by the very fluid and moderately fluid manner of failure (Ase and Cse horizons).\n5. Sapric soil material - the zone from 88 to 191 cm (2Oabse, 2Oab1, and 2Oab2 horizons).\n6. Thapto-histic - buried layer of organic material, 20 cm or more thick, within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface (2Oabse, 2Oab1, and 2Oab2 horizons).\n7. Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 88 cm (Cse1 and Cse2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nThis pedon was sampled as RI009-2009-016-NP by University of Rhode Island.  Support pedons used to develop this series include RI009-2007-007-PJ (sampled by the University of Rhode Island), RI009-2004-003-NP (sampled by the University of Rhode Island), PJ018, and GH007.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
