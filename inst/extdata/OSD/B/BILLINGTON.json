  "REVDATE": "06/2018",
  "STATES": "CT,RI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Billington series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils that are permanently submerged beneath 10 to 200cm or more of tidal estuarine water in mainland coves within coastal lagoons and bays. Billington soils are formed in silty marine and estuarine deposits over buried organic material. Organic materials are mainly derived from woody fresh water environments or herbaceous tidal peat and occur within 40 through 100 cm of the soil surface. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent, mean annual air temperature is 10 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is 1295 mm.",

Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 1.2 m of water at the time of coring).\n2. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 cm (Ase horizon).\n3. Sulfidic materials - the zone from 0 to 88 cm (Ase and Cse horizons).\n4. High n-value - the zone from 0 to 88 cm has an n-value greater than 0.7, as surmised by the very fluid and moderately fluid manner of failure (Ase and Cse horizons).\n5. Sapric soil material - the zone from 88 to 191 cm (2Oabse, 2Oab1, and 2Oab2 horizons).\n6. Thapto-histic - buried layer of organic material, 20 cm or more thick, within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface (2Oabse, 2Oab1, and 2Oab2 horizons).\n7. Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 88 cm (Cse1 and Cse2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nThis pedon was sampled as RI009-2009-016-NP by University of Rhode Island.  Support pedons used to develop this series include RI009-2007-007-PJ (sampled by the University of Rhode Island), RI009-2004-003-NP (sampled by the University of Rhode Island), PJ018, and GH007.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
