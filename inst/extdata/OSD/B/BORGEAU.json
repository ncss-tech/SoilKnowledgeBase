    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick.   The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.55 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 65 percent metamorphic rock fragments and 10 to 18 percent clay.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is less than 75 percent throughout the upper 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry.  It has 0 to 30 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4, moist or dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly loam.  It has 20 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Louiscreek soils have base saturation (sum of cations) of 75 to 100 percent except in the upper part of the A horizon where it is 50 to 75 percent.  Lenz, Raisio and Vanbrunt soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to lithic contact.  Sinlahekin soils average 3 to 8 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Speigle soils have 2Bt horizons. Whitestone soils have granitic rock fragments and have a high content of quartz and feldspar minerals in the particle-size control section."

The soils formed in glacial till and colluvium from metamorphic rock.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, the mean annual July temperature is about 66 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Inkler soils are frigid, have an admixture of volcanic ash in the upper part, and are on foothills and mountains. Raisio soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact and are on south-facing footslopes, sideslopes and ridgetops of mountains.  Republic soils are coarse-loamy, frigid, and are on alluvial fans, terrace and footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  Stevens soils are coarse-loamy, have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick, and are on south-facing hillsides, rounded hilltops, mountainsides and ridgetops."
