  "OVERVIEW": "The Barhiskey series consists of deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium mixed with pumice and volcanic ash.  Barhiskey soils are on outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Barhiskey soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has 2 to 5 percent clay and contains 20 to 35 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 5 percent are cobbles and 20 to 30 percent are gravel.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and has a base saturation of 25 to 50 percent.  It is moderately to slightly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe AC horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist."
