    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Barhiskey soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has 2 to 5 percent clay and contains 20 to 35 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 5 percent are cobbles and 20 to 30 percent are gravel.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and has a base saturation of 25 to 50 percent.  It is moderately to slightly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe AC horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist."

These soils formed in sandy alluvium mixed with pumice and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
