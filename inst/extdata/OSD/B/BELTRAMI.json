  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beltrami series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy glacial till on moraines.  These soils have moderately rapid or moderate permeability in the upper part, and moderate or moderately slow permeability in the lower part.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates typically ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  A thick solum phase is recognized where depth to carbonates is 40 to 60 inches or more.  The profile contains 2 to 10 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A or Ap horizons have value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  It interfingers into the Bt horizon in some pedons but is less than 15 percent of the horizon.\nSome pedons have BE horizons.  The eluvial part is than 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Chroma ranges to 2 in the lower part in some pedons.  It has redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 30 to 45 percent sand.  B/A clay ratios typically are 1.4 to 1.6.  The B horizon is typically moderately acid to neutral but ranges to strongly acid in thick solum pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically loam or clay loam, but thin subhorizons of fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam are in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 12 to 30 percent.  Some pedons do not have a Bk horizon.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with properties similar to the Bk.  Some pedons also have a BC horizon."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.    The frost-free days range from 95 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1700 feet."

Very poorly drained Bluffton soils are in depressions.  Well drained Nebish soils have convex slopes and are on higher lying terrain.   Poorly drained Shooker soils are on nearly level terrain.  Organic soils are associated in many places."
