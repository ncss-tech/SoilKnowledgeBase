The soils have a udic moisture regime but they have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Thickness of the solum is 15 to 30 inches.  It is moderately or slightly acid.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments in the 10- to 40-inch control section range from 35 to 80 percent.  The umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam.  This horizon has moderate or strong granular or fine or very fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2, 3 or 4 moist, 4, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam, extremely gravelly or very gravelly loam with 20 to 50 percent gravel and  20 to 35 percent cobbles and less than 18 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has characteristics similar to the B horizon except for being massive and having 35 to 80 percent coarse fragments."

Harrington soils have Bw horizons with more than 18 percent clay and hue redder than 7.5YR.  Klickitat, Nordby and Spivey soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Milbury soils are very strongly or strongly acid.  Summers soils; the series has not been revised and it is anticipated it will not be used in  the future.  Wauld soils average 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brightwood soils are on smooth and dissected hill slopes in mountainous areas at elevations of 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  Slopes range from 60 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in very gravelly colluvium weathered from tuff and tuffaceous breccia bedrock.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 34 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F..  The frost-free season is 100 to 180 days."
