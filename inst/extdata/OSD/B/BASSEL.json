  "OVERVIEW": "The Bassel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and/or conglomerate.  Bassel soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C. (37 degrees F)",
