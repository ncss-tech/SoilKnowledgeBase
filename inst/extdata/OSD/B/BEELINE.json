  "OVERVIEW": "The Beeline series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Beeline soils are on fan terraces and hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.",
