  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments are primarily shale, but some are sandstone and siltstone. They range from 0 to 30 percent in the A horizon, from 0 to 50 percent in individual horizons of the Bt, and from 15 to 90 percent in the BC and C horizons. Unlimed reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Fine-earth texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are in one or more horizons of the B horizon between depths of 12 to 30 inches.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, or in some places silty clay loam or silty clay in the fine-earth fraction."

Adelphia, Bigpool, Holmdel, Whiteside and Woodstown soils are very deep to bedrock.  Kensington and Trackler soils are deep to bedrock.  Wharton soils are deep and very deep to bedrock.  A lithic contact does not occur in any of these soils within 40 inches of the surface.\nCotaco, Delanco, Dillard, and Tuscarawas soils are in related families. Cotaco, Delanco, and Tuscarawas soils do not have bedrock within 40 inches. The Dillard soils have mica in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients are dominantly between 2 and 8 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from noncalcareous gray shale and some sandstone. Climate is humid and temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F.; the growing season ranges from 150 to 190 days."
