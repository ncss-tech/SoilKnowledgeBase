  "STATUS": "Tentative Series",

  "REVDATE": "02/2014",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Broback series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum from sandstone and shale. These soils are on eroded fan remnants sideslopes and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 330 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
