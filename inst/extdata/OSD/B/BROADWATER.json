  "OVERVIEW": "The Broadwater series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in stratified sandy and gravelly alluvium on valley flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches at the type location, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
