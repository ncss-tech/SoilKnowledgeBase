  "OVERVIEW": "The Battlefield series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly outwash deposits on lake terraces, outwash plains, and beach deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
