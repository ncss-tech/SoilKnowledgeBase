  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluecreek series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Bluecreek soils are on alluvial fan and stream terraces with slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
