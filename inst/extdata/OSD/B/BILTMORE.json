  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The sandy sediments range from 40 to 80 inches or more in thickness.  In some pedons below a depth of 40 inches, there are strata of loamy material, or deposits of cobbles and gravel that are stratified with sandy or loamy material.  Thin loamy layers are within the upper 40 inches in some pedons, but have a combined thickness of less than 6 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the upper 40 inches.  Underlying beds of gravel and cobbles are in many pedons within a 40 to 80 inch depth.  Flakes of mica range from few to many throughout.  The soil ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Where value is 3 and chroma of 1 to 3, the horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  An Ab horizon is in some pedons. It has the same color and texture range as the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The C horizon to depths of at least 40 inches is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.  Thin strata of sandy loam, loam, or silt loam are in some pedons but total less than 6 inches in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section.\nThe C horizon below depths of 40 inches may have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Also, it may consist of cobbles and gravel stratified with sandy or loamy sediments."

Abscota, Oakville, Plainfield, and Tyner soils have a lower rainfall range.  Caesar, Penwood, Plainfield, and Windsor soils are excessively drained, and Tyner soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Also, Caesar, Oakville, Penwood, Plainfield, Tyner, and Windsor soils may occur on moderately steep, steep, or very steep side slopes.  Chute, Hodge, and Sarpy soils are neutral to moderately alkaline throughout. Dabney and Westport soils receive more than 60 inches of precipitation annually.  Perks soils have high chroma mottles within a depth of 40 inches.  Pinegrove soils contain fragments of sandstone from surface mining operations.  Spessard soils do not have mica flakes.  Suncook soils are excessively drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Biltmore soils are on flood plains of the intermountain valleys adjacent to major streams.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in sandy alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is 39 inches near the type location.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 60 inches."

These soils are all in coarse-loamy or finer-textured families.  Braddock, Brevard, Elsinboro, and Tate soils have an argillic horizon and are on adjacent stream terraces, fans or benches.  Colvard, Iotla, Rosman, and Transylvania soils are on flood plains further from the channel than Biltmore soils.  Hatboro and Toxaway soils have poorer drainage and occupy the lower parts of the flood plain.  Rosman and Transylvania soils have an umbric A or Ap horizon."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage of this soil is cleared of forest and used for pasture and crops.  Important crops grown are corn for grain and silage, small grains, truck crops, burley tobacco, and pasture.  Native forest species include white pine, yellow-poplar, northern red oak, black oak, white oak, black walnut, American Sycamore, red maple, river birch, American beech, white ash, black locust, hickory, basswood, and blackgum. Rhododendron and blueberry are common understory plants."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Biltmore soils were formerly mapped in Comus and Suncook series. Establishing the Biltmore series limits the Suncook series to MLRA's 143, 144, and 145.  The 2/89 revision reclassified the Biltmore series to mixed, mesic Typic Udipsamments.  The typical pedon and a dominance of soils mapped Biltmore do not have at least 6 inches of loamy strata between the A horizon and a depth of 40 inches.  The distribution and extent of the Biltmore series has been broadened due to the recognition of a mesic soil temperature regime in some areas of the Southern Piedmont.\nSelected data from the typical pedon - NSSL No. 92P0084:\nDepth         Percent      Fine Sand Mineralogy\nHorizon    (in.)
