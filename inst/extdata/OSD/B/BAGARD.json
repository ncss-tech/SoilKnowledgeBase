    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 21 to 50 inches thick, and the regolith is more than 40 inches thick. Coarse fragments in the control section range from 35 to 60 percent, and are mainly cobbles and stones. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 degrees to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 65 degrees F. The soils are dry in the moisture control section 51 to 55 percent of the time soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. In more than 7 out of 10 years the soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer months and are moist for 60 to 70 consecutive days during the 120 days after the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon ranges from brown to dark brown, with value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nIt is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon ranges from brown to dark brown, with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4. It is cobbly or very cobbly clay loam to cobbly or very cobbly clay with 35 to 60 percent cobbles or stones. This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  It contains few to many, moderately thick clay films.\nThe BC horizon, when present, is similar to the Bt horizon in color. It is cobbly or very cobbly loam to very cobbly clay, with 35 to 80 percent cobbles and stones.\nThe C horizon ranges from noncalcareous to moderately calcareous."

Fera soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches, are noncalcareous throughout and have coarse fragments dominated by gravel. Gosumi and Quarz soils have gravel size coarse fragments. Kleckner soils have a Bq horizon.  Slaven and Snellby soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bagard soils are on moderately sloping to steep hillside slopes. They formed in alluvium or colluvium from mixed igneous rock, sandstone, and shale. These soils occur at elevations of 6,000 to 7,200 feet. The climate is dry subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 degrees to 45 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 100 days."
