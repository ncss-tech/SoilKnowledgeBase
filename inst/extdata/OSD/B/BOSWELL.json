  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. In severely eroded pedons, the Ap horizon has mixed colors from the upper part of the Bt horizon. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.  In severely eroded pedons, texture includes silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has the same texture range as the A or Ap horizon.\nThe BE or EB horizon, where present, is a mix of the E and the upper part of the Bt horizon. It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 5.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe upper Bt horizons have hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red and gray range from none to many. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  A few pedons have a thin horizon of sandy clay loam this is generally less than 4 inches in thickness.\nThe lower Bt horizons have no dominant color and are multicolored in shades of red, gray, brown or yellow.  In most pedons the basal Bt subhorizon has a gray matrix not related to wetness and having redox features in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Btss horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Bt horizons. Texture is clay loam or clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Gore series is the only known soil in the same family.  The Susquehanna series is in a closely related family.  Gore soils are on terrace positions in the Western Coastal Plain (MLRA 133B).  The somewhat poorly drained Susquehanna soils are on slightly lower positions and have smectitic mineralogy."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boswell soils are on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area (133A).  They formed in acid clayey marine or fluviatile sediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 17 percent.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 53 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the closely related Susquehanna soils and the Angie, Cahaba, Lucy, Ora, Rumford, Ruston, Sawyer, Shubuta, Smithdale and Wilcox series.  All are Ultisols except the Wilcox series. Angie soils are on similar to lower positions, have yellower subsoils and show no sign of vertic development.  The well drained Cahaba, Ruston, and Smithdale soils have fine-loamy control sections.  In addition, Cahaba soils are on lower adjacent terraces that are subject to rare flooding.  The well drained Lucy soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  Ora soils are on similar to lower positions and have a fragipan.  The well to somewhat excessively drained Rumford soils are on higher positions and have coarse-loamy control sections.  The well drained Shubuta soils are on similar to slightly higher positions. The somewhat poorly drained Wilcox soils are Vertisols, are on similar positions, are underlain by shale at a 40 to 60-inch depth and have very-fine smectitic clay control sections."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 5 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 5 to 70 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5 and Bt6 horizons).\nVertic features - more than 35 percent clay throughout the Bt horizon and slickensides that do not intersect in the zone from approximately 23 to 70 inches (Bt4, Bt5, Bt6 horizons.\nBase Saturation - More than 35 percent.\nNo free water has been observed in these soils but soil morphology suggests that they may be saturated within a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet of the surface for short periods during winter and spring.\nADDITIONAL DATA: There are no known samples of Boswell in the database. Soils sampled as Boswell correlated into other series.
