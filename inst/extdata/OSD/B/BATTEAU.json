    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Gravel and cobble size rock fragments commonly range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil, but may range to 60 percent in the Bw and C horizons below 40 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value of 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.   The A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value of 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It has mottles within 20 inches of the soil surface in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Silt loam and silty clay loam are limited to individual subhorizons in some pedons.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It has mottles in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons are stratified."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Batteau soils are on flood plains of the Piedmont plateau. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. They formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, limestone, shale, siltstone, sandstone, phyllite, and greenstone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F.  Annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

These soils are on flood plains.  Chewacla, Riverview, Toccoa, and Wehadkee soils do not have thick dark surface layers.  Galtsmill and Wingina soils do not have gray mottles within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Wehadkee and Yogaville soils have gray mottles higher in the profile."
