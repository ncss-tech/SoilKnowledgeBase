  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.  It is strongly saline alkali in the upper 24 to 36 inches of the pedon.  The pH ranges from 7.9 to 9.0 in the A and C horizons.  Some gypsum is present in the upper parts of the pedon in nearly all areas.  Organic carbon decreases regularly with increasing depth.\nThe Ap or upper 10 inches of the C horizon is very pale brown, pale brown, or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/3, 7/3, 6/4).  Typically it is clay but ranges to silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C1 and C2 horizons to a depth of about 40 inches are pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4).  They are clay or silty clay.  Clay content in the control section is 45 to 55 percent and gradually increases with depth and is as high as 70 percent at a depth of 60 inches in some pedons.\nThe C3ca horizon is light yellowish brown, pale brown, or light gray (10YR 6/4, 6/3, 7/1, 7/2).  Segregated lime below 40 inches ranges from few to common, fine to medium soft masses and concretions.  This horizon ranges from few to common, fine to medium soft masses and concretions.  This horizon ranges from 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bousic soils are on basin rim areas adjacent to playas and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in mixed fine textured alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock sources.  Elevations are 2,850 to 2,900 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 or 5 inches, most of which falls as rain in the winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow.  The average January temperature is about 46 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 84 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The frost free season is 210 to 255 days."
