  "OVERVIEW": "The Barten series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt.  Barten soils are on basalt lava flows with slopes of 4 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
