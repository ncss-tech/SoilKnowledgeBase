The Lemitar soils are formed in residuum derived from tuff and have a reaction class of neutral or less in the Bt and Btk, they aslo are at elevations of 5,000 to 7,200 feet and have bed rock at 8 to 14 inches.  Pantak and Whitvin soils do not have accmulation of calcium carbonates in the profile.  In addition, Pantak soils are neutral to slightly acid and Whitvin soils have hues redder than 7.5YR."
