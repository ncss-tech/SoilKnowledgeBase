  "OVERVIEW": "The Boggy series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained,  moderately permeable soils that formed in recent alluvial  sediments that weathered from rocks of Cretaceous age.  These soils are on narrow, nearly level flood plains of the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B).  They are saturated for short periods in winter and spring.  Water runs off the surface very slowly.  Slope is mainly less than 1 percent.",

Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid to a depth of  21 inches and ranges from strongly to medium acid below 21 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, but includes chroma of 3 in pedons that have dominantly 2 chroma C horizons that occur within 20  inches of the surface.  Where value and chroma are less than 3.5 in the A1 horizon, the horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  Redox concentrations or depletions of iron are in shades of brown or gray.  Thickness of the A horizons ranges from 12 to 32 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chromas of 1 or 2, but includes chroma of 3 in pedons that have A horizons that are dominantly 2 chroma and extend below a depth of 20 inches.  Redox concentrations or depletions of iron are in shades of brown or gray.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boggy soils are on narrow flood plains,  usually less than 0.25 mile in width, of the Western Coastal  Plains (MLRA 133B).  These soils are formed in recent alluvial sediments that weathered from rocks of Cretaceous age.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual  precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches and is evenly  distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual air temperature ranges  from 60 degrees to 66 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices  ranges from 64 to 76.  Frost free days range from 200 to 225.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 800 feet.  The climate is humid."
