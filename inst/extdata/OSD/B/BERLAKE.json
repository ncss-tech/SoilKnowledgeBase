The Assinniboine, Beavwan, Crittenden, Eapa, Emlin, Evanot, Evanston, Joplin, Kevin, Morval, Notter, Nuley, Reicess, Sugakool, Telstad, Varney, and Villa Grove soils all have continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate above 40 inches.  Cheesman, Marmarth, and Udecide soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Duffson soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bostwick and Jarre soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizons.  Turret soils have loamy-skeletal C horizons or substrata at depths of 20 to 50 inches. Kenilworth soils have lithologic discontinuities at depths of 10 to 26 inches.

It differs in patterns of precipitation which results in marked differences in vegetation.\nAridic feature:  has a moisture control section that is dry in some part for 0.6 or more of the time.\nWhen the new Mollisol chapter is approved, this series needs to be reclassified to an Aridic Argiustoll.\nTaxonomy Version: Seventh Edition, 1996.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
