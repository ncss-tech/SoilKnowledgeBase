  "OVERVIEW": "The Berlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone.  These soils are on hills, plateaus, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Cheesman, Marmarth, and Udecide soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Duffson soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bostwick and Jarre soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizons.  Turret soils have loamy-skeletal C horizons or substrata at depths of 20 to 50 inches.

It differs in patterns of precipitation which results in marked differences in vegetation.\nAridic feature:  has a moisture control section that is dry in some part for 0.6 or more of the time.\nWhen the new Mollisol chapter is approved, this series needs to be reclassified to an Aridic Argiustoll.\nTaxonomy Version: Seventh Edition, 1996.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
