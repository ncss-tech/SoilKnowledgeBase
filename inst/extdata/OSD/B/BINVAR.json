  "OVERVIEW": "The Binvar series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and have extremely gravelly loamy sand at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans, and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
