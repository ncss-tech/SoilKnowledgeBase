  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  The solum is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The C horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a muck surface layer as much as 6 inches thinck.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 18 and 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where present, the A horizon has the same colors as the Ap horizon.  The texture of the A horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the mucky analogues.\nThe Bg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 2.  Where there are no mottles, chroma is 1.  Texture is variable in short horizontal distances and commonly is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.  Many pedons contain thin strata of coarser and finer textures.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4.  Chromas of more than 2 are below a depth of 30 inches.  The C horizon predominantly contains strata of silt, very fine sand, fine sand, or silt loam; but finer material as well as medium sands are within the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The strata range from 1/2 to 15 inches in thickness."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hettinger series in the same family and the Angelica, Colwood, Parkhill, and Tonkey series.  Hettinger soils have B horizons averaging between 27 and 35 percent clay. Angelica soils are without stratification in the sola. Colwood soils have mollic epipedons and are mesic.  Parkhill soils do not have stratifications and are mesic.  Tonkey soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in loamy and sandy stratified lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 42 to 46 degrees F."
