  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Benevolence soils are on broad ridges and side slopes in the Southern Coastal Plain.  They formed in loamy and sandy marine sediments.  Slopes are generally convex and range from 0 to 15 percent.  Climate is warm and humid and is characterized by cool wet winters and hot summers with variable rainfall.  The average annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 50 inches.  The frost-free period ranges from 225 to 285 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Ailey, Americus, Cowarts, Lakeland, Lucy, Nankin, Orangeburg, Red Bay, Springhill, and Troup soils.  Ailey and Lucy soils are on slightly lower positions and have surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  In addition, Ailey soils have a dense 2C horizon.  Americus, Lakeland, Orangeburg, Red Bay, Springhill, and Troup soils are on similar positions.  In addition, Americus soils do not have a kandic horizon, are Rhodic, and have a sandy particle-size control section.  Lakeland soils are sandy throughout and Orangeburg soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Red Bay and Springhill soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Troup soils have sandy A and E horizons 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  Cowarts and Nankin soils are on lower more sloping positions.  In addition, Cowarts soils have a thinner solum and are fine-loamy, and Nankin soils have clayey control sections."

Cultivated crops include peanuts, cotton, corn, and soybeans.  The woodland vegetation consists of longleaf pine, loblolly pine, and slash pine with scattered oaks, hickory, and dogwood."
