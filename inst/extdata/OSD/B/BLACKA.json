These soils formed in loess over alluvium from mixed rock sources dominated by volcanic rocks, tuff, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
