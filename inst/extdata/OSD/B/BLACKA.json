  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacka series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The Blacka soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
