  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the Cr horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches, and the depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of veined quartz and phyllite range from 15 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and from 35 to 90 percent in the B and C horizons.  The fine- earth fraction of the textural control section has greater than 50 percent silt and very fine sand.  Soil reaction ranges from medium acid to slightly acid if not limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 10R, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr (bedrock) horizon can be dug with hand tools; the R (hard bedrock) horizon cannot be dug with hand tools."

The soils formed in residuum of weathered beds of phyllite.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."

Airy, and Occoquan soils are on nearby landscapes.  All of these soils are greater than 20 inches to bedrock.  Brinklow and Occoquan soils are on broader ridges and lower segments of side slopes. Glenville soils are around the heads of drainageways and have a fragipan."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Blocktown series has previously been included in the Linganore, Urbana, Chester, Glenelg, and Manor series.  The Linganore series is moderately deep, Urbana soils are classified as Aquic Fragiudalfs, and Chester, Glenelg, and Manor soils are very deep and are developed from micaceous schist.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 17 inches (Bt horizon).\nc. Paralithic contact - the zone from 17 to 21 inches (Cr horizon).\nd. Lithic contact - at 21 inches (R horizon).\nAdditional data:  Laboratory data are not available at this time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
