  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluesprin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on plateaus, canyon sides and hillsides.  They formed in material weathered from basalt or andesite bedrock with a thin mantle of loess.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 7 to 90 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",
