    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bluesprin soils are on plateaus, south and west-facing hills and canyon sides.  Slopes range from 7 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from basalt or andesite bedrock with a thin mantle of loess at elevations of 1,900 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, with an average annual precipitation of 16 to 25 inches.  The average frost-free period is from 100 to 160 days."
