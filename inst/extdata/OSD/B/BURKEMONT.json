Depth to the\nfluctuating water table is 12 to 24 inches from early spring\nthrough early summer.  Depth to the 2Bk horizon ranges from\n20 to 40 inches.  The sodium adsorption ratio is 20 to 70\npercent in half or more of the upper 20 inches of the\nprofile.  The particle-size control section ranges from\nsilty clay loam to clay, and averages 35 to 60 percent clay.\nCoarse fragments are 0 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5\nmoist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The\nAkn3 horizon has common to many faint or distinct mottles.\nThe Bkn and 2Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6\nmoist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and\ndry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThese horizons have common to many faint or distinct\nmottles.  The soil reaction is moderate to strongly alkaline\nwith lime disseminated throughout the profile or segregated\nin irregularly shaped filaments and threads."
