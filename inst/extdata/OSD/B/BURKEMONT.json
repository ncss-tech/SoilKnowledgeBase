The sodium adsorption ratio is 20 to 70\npercent in half or more of the upper 20 inches of the\nprofile.  The particle-size control section ranges from\nsilty clay loam to clay, and averages 35 to 60 percent clay.\nCoarse fragments are 0 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5\nmoist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The\nAkn3 horizon has common to many faint or distinct mottles.\nThe Bkn and 2Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6\nmoist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and\ndry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThese horizons have common to many faint or distinct\nmottles.
