Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,500 feet.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. and the freeze-free period ranges from 110 to 160 days.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 11 inches ."

Ferron, Green River and Rafael soils have water tables and occur in stream channels downslope from Billings soils.  Penner soils are coarse-silty and occur on stream terraces adjacent to Billings soils."
