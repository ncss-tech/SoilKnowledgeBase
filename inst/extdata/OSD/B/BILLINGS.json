  "STATES": "CO,NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Billings series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from marine alkaline shale and mixed sedimentary rocks. Billings soils are on flood plains,flood-plain steps, and valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
