    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bluehill soils are on south-facing slopes of fan terraces, hills, and mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,405 to 1,800 meters. The soil formed in alluvium and residuum derived from volcanic ash. The climate is cold and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer. The average annual precipitation is about 300 to 400 mm. The average annual air temperature is about 7 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free season is 85 to 120 days."
