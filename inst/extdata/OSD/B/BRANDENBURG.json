  "OVERVIEW": "The Brandenburg series are very deep, excessively drained soils.  They are 10 to 20 inches over shattered porcelanite bedrock.  They formed in residuum from porcelanite and have moderate over very rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil has more than 35 percent by volume of rock fragments although the surface layer in some pedons has as little as 10 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is sandy loam or loam. The upper 7 inches when mixed has 7.5YR or redder hue, value of 4 to 6, more than 3 moist and chroma of 2 or more.  It has 10 to 55 percent rock fragments consisting of gravel or channers.\nThe C1 horizon is sandy loam or loam containing more than 45 percent by volume of channery material.  The C2 material is shattered porcelanite, argillites or clinkers containing carbonates."

The Brandenburg soils formed in residuum containing more than 45 percent by volume of hard porcelanite coarser than 2 mm.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches, 70 or 80 percent of which falls when the soil is not frozen.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F."

Cabba, Flasher and Yawdim soils are underlain with soft sandstone, siltstone, or shale at depths of 8 to 20 inches. Ringling and Searing soils have mollic epipedons.  In addition, Searing soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to porcelanite."
