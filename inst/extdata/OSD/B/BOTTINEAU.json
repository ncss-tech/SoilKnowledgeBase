  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness and typically includes the upper part of the argillic horizon. The soil contains up to 10 percent by volume of coarse fragments throughout.  Depth to carbonates is greater than 10 inches. Uncoated sand grains are on faces of peds in the Bt horizon and commonly the A horizon.\nThe Oi horizon is less than 3 inches thick. In some pedons it is not present due to removal of trees and cultivation.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1. It is loam or clay loam. It is slightly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or clay loam averaging between 22 and 35 percent clay. It is slightly acid or slightly alkaline. Some pedons have a Bw horizon.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. Soft masses and threads of carbonates are common. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have Bk or BCk horizons.\nThe C horizon has colors and textures similar to the Btk horizon. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bottineau soils are on level to hilly uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in loamy glacial till.  The climate is subhumid with warm summer and long cold winters.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 23 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 100 to 120 days and elevation ranges from 1000 to 2500 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aastad, Buse, Eramosh, Kelvin, Parnell, Rolla, and Tonka soils. Aastad soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches thick. Buse soils do not have an argillic horizon and have carbonates within a depth of 7 inches. Buse soils are higher and Aastad soils are lower on the landscape than the Bottineau soils. Rolla soils are on nearby collapsed lake plains and are clayey.  Eramosh soils are in fens and Parnell and Tonka soils are in potholes; all three soils are ponded during part of the growing season."

Native vegetation is bur oak, American elm, green ash, and quaking aspen with numerous shrubs and a nearly continuous grass cover. A few areas have been cleared and used for small grains, alfalfa or native hay."
