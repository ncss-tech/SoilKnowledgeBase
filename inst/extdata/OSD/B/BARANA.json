  "OVERVIEW": "The Barana series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that have formed in mixed alluvium.  Barana soils are on plains and swales.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
