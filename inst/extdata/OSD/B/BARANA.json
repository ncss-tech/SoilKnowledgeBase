Barana soils have formed in alluvium derived from many sources. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 5,300 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 180 to 210 days."

(Btk2 and Bk horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab Data from profile S77-NM-028-9, characterized at New Mexico State University, lends support for the presence of an argillic horizon, a weak calcic horizon and placement of this soil in an Ustollic subgroup.\nCalcium carbonate equivalence was determined on other selected pedons, including the type location, with use of a field volume calcimeter.\nSoil Taxonomy: Ninth Edition 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
