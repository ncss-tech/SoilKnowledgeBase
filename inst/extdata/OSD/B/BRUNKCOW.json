  "OVERVIEW": "The Brunkcow series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite, gneiss and metamorphic rock. Brunkcow soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches (356 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F (17.2 degrees C).",
