  "OVERVIEW": "The Balon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium dominantly from schist, granite, basalt and related rocks. Balon soils are on fan terraces. Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F",

The regolith consists of mixed fan alluvium dominantly from schist, granite, basalt and related rocks. These soils are in a cool, semi-arid, continental climate, having a mean annual temperature of 50 degrees to 58 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms in July through September and as rain and snow during the winter months. The frost-free period ranges from 144 and 223 days."

Abra soils have a high lime content throughout and do not have an argillic horizon. Arp soils are redder, having hues of 5YR and 2.5YR and are fine-textured. Cordes soils are moderately coarse-textured and have a mollic epipedon. Lynx soils are in a fine-loamy family but are dark-colored and have a mollic epipedon. Moano soils have a lithic contact at shallow depths and are residual on schist. Pastura soils lack a Bt horizon and have a petrocalcic horizon at shallow depths."
