  "OVERVIEW": "The Barnhardt series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and glacial outwash.  Barnhardt soils are on outwash terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has, by weighted average, 50 to 75 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry.  It is gravelly loam in the upper part and very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam or extremely gravelly loam in the lower part.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Within the particle-size control section, it is very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Below the control section, it is gravelly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loamy sand."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 3 inches, and a spodic horizon from 3 to 21 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria but does have micro morphological characteristics of a spodic horizon, i.e. silt-sized pellets and cracked coats."
