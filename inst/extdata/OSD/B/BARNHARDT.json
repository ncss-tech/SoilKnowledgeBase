    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Thickness of volcanic ash influence is 60 inches or more.  Thickness of the solum is 8 to 30 inches.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has, by weighted average, 50 to 75 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry.  It is gravelly loam in the upper part and very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam or extremely gravelly loam in the lower part.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Within the particle-size control section, it is very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Below the control section, it is gravelly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loamy sand."

Blethen and Heisler soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and Heisler soils are 35 to 60 percent phyllite in the particle-size control section.  Kickerville soils are less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section and have a 2C horizon that is sand or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction.  Tunnel soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bs horizon.  Vanzandt soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with dense glacial till."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barnhardt soils are on outwash terraces at elevations of 50 to 300 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and glacial outwash.  Barnhardt soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from medial-skeletal Andic Xerochrepts to loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 3 inches, and a spodic horizon from 3 to 21 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria but does have micro morphological characteristics of a spodic horizon, i.e. silt-sized pellets and cracked coats.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
