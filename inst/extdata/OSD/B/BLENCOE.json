  "OVERVIEW": "The Blencoe series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains and flood-plain steps. These soils formed in 51 to 102 centimeters of clayey alluvium and underlying loamy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 millimeters.",
