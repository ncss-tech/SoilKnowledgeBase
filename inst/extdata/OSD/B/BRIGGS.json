  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 to 58 inches and is the same as the depth to the base of the B23t horizon ranges from 24 to 36 inches.  Coarse fragments exceed 35 percent by volume of the 10 to 40-inch control section and of the argillic horizon.  Individual subhorizons above the B23t horizon range from gravel free to extremely gravelly.  Organic matter exceeds 2 percent at a depth of 9 inches.\nIn undisturbed areas, the soil has either an O or an A1 horizon; some pedons have A2 horizons, others lack them.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from loamy sand to fine sandy loam and gravelly and cobbly phases of these, the latter being most common.  It has weak granular structure or is structureless, single grain, is loose to friable, and is strongly to extremely acid where not limed.\nThe Bir horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Yr.  Where it underlies an Ap horizon value is 4 through 6, but where it underlies an A1 or an O horizon the upper 2 inches in some pedons has value of less than 4.  Chroma ranges from 3 through 6, increasing as depth increases below 10 inches.  Texture has the same range as than of the Ap horizon.  Structure is weak or very weak granular, consistence is very friable or loose, reaction is very strongly to medium acid, and the lower boundary ranges wavy to irregular.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y\nthrough 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is very gravelly or cobbly fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The horizon is structureless, massive or has weak blocky or granular structure.  Consistence is very friable to friable, but the horizon is distinctly more sticky than the horizons above.  Clay films are prominent on pebbles and in pores, and conspicuous clay bridges are between sand grains.  The horizon is medium acid to neutral.  The lower boundary ranges from wavy to irregular.\nThe C horizon is calcareous sand, gravel, and cobblestones in varying proportions and degrees or stratification."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Related or similar soils are in the Caribou, Colosse, Colton, Hickley, and Kars series.  The Caribou series have finer texture.  The Colosse, Colton, and Hinckley soils have spodic horizons but lack argillic horizons.  The Kars soils lack spodic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Briggs soils are on outwash terraces, kames, eskers, beaches, and bars.  Slopes range from nearly level to steep.  The regolith is coarse water sorted material dominated by acid sandstone and granite and includes some limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches; and mean growing season ranges from 90 to 135 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Brayton, Greenville, Moira, and Nellis soils are common associated on glacial till, the Nellis or Grenville soils being on till that is high in lime. The Colton or Hickley soils are on nearby very gravelly or cobbly drift that contains little or no limestone."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Briggs soils were formerly considered as having a Podzol upper sequum and a Gray-Brown Podzolic lower sequum.  The kind of profile described also occurs under mesic temperature regime in parts of Northern New York and near the southern border of the Adirondack Mountains.  The frigid regime is believed to dominate.  In mapping, soils with as little as 30 inch depth to carbonates and the bottom of the B2t horizon  are included with Briggs series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
