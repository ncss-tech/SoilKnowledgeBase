  "OVERVIEW": "The Bond series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and eolian deposits derived from sandstone on cuestas, mesas, hills and ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Typically, the average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, but ranges to 15 inches in some areas; mean annual air temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days. In Colorado, the temperature ranges as low as 43 degrees F. In Arizona elevations are as low as 4,500 feet, temperatures as high 55 degrees and frost free as long as 165 days."
