Bondman and Frontier soils are moist during May and June and have mean annual soil temperatures of 47 to 50 degrees F. Kech soils have identifiable secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate and attempt to reflect the effects of soil forming agents unique to the Great Plains."

They formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and eolian deposits from sandstone. Elevations are 5,600 to 7,200 feet. Typically, the average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, but ranges to 15 inches in some areas; mean annual air temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days. In Colorado, the temperature ranges as low as 43 degrees F. In Arizona elevations are as low as 4,500 feet, temperatures as high 55 degrees and frost free as long as 165 days."
