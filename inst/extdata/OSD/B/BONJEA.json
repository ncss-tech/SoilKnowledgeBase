  "REVDATE": "05/1999",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonjea series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to igneous or metamorphic bedrock.  They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum from granite and gneiss on foothills and gently sloping to steep mountainsides. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
