  "OVERVIEW": "The Bramwell series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils\non floodplains and low terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.\nPermeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is\nabout 51 degrees F.",
