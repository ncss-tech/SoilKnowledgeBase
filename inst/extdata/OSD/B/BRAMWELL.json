  "OVERVIEW": "The Bramwell series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils on floodplains and low terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches (230 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F (11 degrees C).",
