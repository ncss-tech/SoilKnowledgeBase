    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beewon soils are on broad, mid-Pleistocene pediments.  These soils formed in gravelly and cobbly alluvium derived mainly from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations, with some sediments derived from Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite and the Cottonwood Springs Basalt.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean  annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, with most occurring July through September.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 4,500 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borunda, Chilicotal, Musgrave, Quadria, Rockpens, and Straddlebug soils.  Borunda soils are in the fine-loamy family, have a gypsic horizon, and are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock.  Borunda soils are on adjacent lower erosional hillslopes and pediments.  Chilicotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on higher alluvial fans.  Musgrave soils are very shallow or shallow to weathered tuffaceous bedrock, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on adjacent steep scarps and sideslopes of Pleistocene terraces.  Quadria soils are on younger, slightly lower mid-Pleistocene pediments.  Rockpens soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on lower late-Pleistocene stream terraces.  Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on lower Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains."
