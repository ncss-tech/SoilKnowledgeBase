  "OVERVIEW": "The Beewon series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on broad uplands.  These nearly level soils formed in skeletal alluvium derived mainly from tuffaceous material associated with the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite (welded tuff), Cottonwood Springs Basalt, and the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

Chilicotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on higher alluvial fans.  Musgrave soils are very shallow or shallow to weathered tuffaceous bedrock, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on adjacent steep scarps and sideslopes of Pleistocene terraces.  Quadria soils are on younger, slightly lower mid-Pleistocene pediments.  Rockpens soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on lower late-Pleistocene stream terraces.  Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on lower Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains."
