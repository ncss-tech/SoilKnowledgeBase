  "OVERVIEW": "The Banida series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium.  Banida soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
