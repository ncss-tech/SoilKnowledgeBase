  "STATES": "OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bratton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on uplands.  They formed in a thin layer of loess and the underlying clayey residuum weathered from limestone or dolomite.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the loess capping ranges from 10 to 22 inches.  Fragments of chert or limestone typically are less than 5 percent in the solum but range from 0 to 20 percent in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap horizon or A horizon is silt loam, except on eroded areas that range to silty clay loam.  It is neutral to medium acid.\nSome pedons have a BE or BA horizon that is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon commonly has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Subhorizons range to hue of 7.5YR.  The 2Bt horizon is clay or silty clay.  It is medium acid or strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.  Some pedons have BC horizons that range to mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5YR; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or their gravelly or channery analogs.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nBedrock is hard limestone or dolomite."

Bland soils have chroma of 2 or 3 throughout the B horizon.  Caneyville and Fredonia soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 10 to 22 inches.  Chrome soils have rock fragments dominated by serpentine and do not have reddish hue.  Derinda, Eden, Edenton, Faywood, Milton, and Shrouts soils do not have reddish hue.  Derinda, Eden, Edenton, Faywood, Milton, and Shrouts soils do not have reddish hue and all except Faywood and Milton have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Donahue soils contain more sand in the upper part of the solum.  Wynn soils have two discontinuities within a depth of 40 inches and have rock fragments of mixed lithology including some crystalline rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bratton soils typically are on summits of loess mantled uplands.  The slope gradient commonly is 2 to 8 percent but ranges up to 25 percent on some dissected areas along drainageways. The soils formed in 10 to 22 inches of loess and the underlying clayey residuum weathered from limestone or dolomite.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 53 to 55 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 43 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boston, Crider, Gasconade, Lowell, Nicholson, and Opequon soils.  Boston soils have a mantle of loess and glacial till over bedrock, have a fragipan, and occur in a complex with Bratton soils in places.  Crider soils have a thicker mantle of loess and are deeper to bedrock but are on similar topographic positions.  Gasconade and Opequon soils are on steeper slopes along drainageways that are shallow to bedrock.  Lowell soils are in similar topographic positions but have thin layers of shale interbedded with the limestone.  Nicholson soils are on similar topographic positions as Bratton soils but have a thicker mantle of loess, are moderately well drained, and have a fragipan."

In some areas, the original cropland is reverting back to woodland and abandoned pasture fields.  The original vegetation was hardwood forest of beech, oaks, hickory, and hard maple."
