  "OVERVIEW": "The Bamber series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from volcanic rocks on mountains at elevations of 3,500 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 39 degrees to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is less than 47 degrees F. The upper part of the control section contains more than 60 percent volcanic ash. The fine earth fraction of the entire control section contains more than 60 percent volcanic ash. The control section averages more than 35 percent coarse fragments. The soil is moderately acid to neutral becoming less acid with depth. Depth to andesite bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.\nThe BC or C horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry. They are very gravelly or very cobbly, have weak structure or are massive."
