The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 39 degrees to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is less than 47 degrees F. The upper part of the control section contains more than 60 percent volcanic ash. The fine earth fraction of the entire control section contains more than 60 percent volcanic ash. The control section averages more than 35 percent coarse fragments. The soil is moderately acid to neutral becoming less acid with depth. Depth to andesite bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.\nThe BC or C horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry. They are very gravelly or very cobbly, have weak structure or are massive."
