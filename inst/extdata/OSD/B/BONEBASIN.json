  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonebasin series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. These soils are on flood plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
