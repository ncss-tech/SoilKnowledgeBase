  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on till plains. They formed in loess and the underlying pedisediment. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 millimeters (42 inches).",
