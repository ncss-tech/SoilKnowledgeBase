Some pedons are underlain, within 80 inches, by a Sangamon age paleosol developed in Illinois age diamicton. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), the mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1219 mm (38 to 48 inches), and the frost-free days range from 180 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 107 to 213 meters (350 to 700 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Ava soils, and the poorly drained Wynoose soils are in a drainage sequence with Bluford soils. Ava soils are on nearby side slopes and convex crests. Wynoose soils are on broad level parts of the till plain. The well-drained Hickory soils are fine-loamy and are on side slopes below Bluford soils. The somewhat poorly drained Hoyleton soils are mollic intergrades and are on similar nearby ridges."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Formerly classified as Aeric Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs. The series is reclassified with this update in order to recognize fragic properties and endosaturation in these soils. Although the high clay subsoil and horizons with fragic properties slow the resaturation of these soils, they are completely resaturated by spring in normal years. Endosaturation better describes the moisture status in these soils for most months. The typical pedon site is relocated to an area on nearly level slopes that better represents the aquic moisture regime. Analysis of supporting NSSL COLE data suggests that the series is not vertic, however the LE/Clay ratio does support smectitic mineralogy. The range in characteristics for the series was adjusted to match the taxonomic classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth 51 cm (20 inches) (Ap and E horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 51 to 152 cm (20 to 60 inches) (the Btg, 2Btgx, and 2Btg horizons);\nfragic properties - brittleness in the zone from 89 to 107 cm (35 to 42 inches) (2Btgx horizon)\naquic conditions - endosaturation, redox accumulations (Fe-Mn accumulations), and redox depletions (low chroma on faces of peds and in matrices);\nAquic moisture regime.\nMesic temperature regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Illinois and NSSL data are available on supporting pedons at the NRCS state office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
