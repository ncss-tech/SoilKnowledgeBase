These soils formed in a loess mantle superimposed over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 8 percent, but are as high as 50 percent on partial ballenas side slopes.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,890 meters. The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 110 days."
