Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BA or AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. The argillic horizon averages 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent and more commonly over 30 percent sand coarser than very fine.\nThe BC and C/BT horizons (where present) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Iron accumulations and depletions, where present, are in shades of brown.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bosket soils are on treads and escarpments of terraces in the Western Lowlands of Arkansas and other areas similar areas of MLRA 131 in the Lower Mississippi River Valley. Many areas are undulating, consisting of low ridges and swales. Slopes are dominantly between 0 to 8 percent, but range to 14 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium. Average annual temperature near the type location is about 62 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 51 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amagon, Bonn, Dexter, Dubbs, Dundee, Foley, Lafe and Tuckerman soils. Amagon, Dexter, Dubbs, Foley and Lafe soils occur on similar terrace positions, Tuckerman soils occur on slightly lower terraces and flood plains. Amagon soils are poorly drained and in a fine-silty family. Bonn and Foley soils are poorly drained and have natric horizons. Dexter and Dubbs soils are in a fine-silty family. Lafe soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a natric horizon. Tuckerman soils are poorly drained."

A few areas are used for pasture and hayland. Native vegetation was mixed hardwoods with an undergrowth of vines and canes."
