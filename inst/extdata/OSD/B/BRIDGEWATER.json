The soils in this project area support ponderosa pine, have sandy loam in the 2C horizon, and are in a 600 to 650 mm precipitation zone. These concepts are outside the range in characteristics for the Bridgewater series; thus, they are not recognized in this official series description. A new series should be considered for areas that support ponderosa pine and have fine subsurface textures.\n6/2016--This official series description was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
