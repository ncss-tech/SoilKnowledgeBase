  "OVERVIEW": "The Burnt Fork series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, and escarpments in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
