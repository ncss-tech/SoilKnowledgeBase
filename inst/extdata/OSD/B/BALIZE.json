  "REVDATE": "03/2019",
  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Balize series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, slowly permeable, fluid mineral soils.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium in areas of active deposition by the Mississippi River and its distributaries.  The sediments were deposited under water and have never air dried and consolidated.  These soils are ponded or flooded most of the time.  Slope is less than 1 percent.",

The horizon is muck or peat.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, mucky silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with values of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, mucky silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Pockets of muck or peat range from none to common.  In some pedons, a sandy 2C horizon with n-value of less than 0.7 is present below a depth of 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

Tatlum soils are saline with EC  ranging from 25 to 90 dS/m.  Arat soils have logs and wood throughout the profile.  Bancker, Barbary, Larose, and Scatlake soils have a very-fine particle-size control section.  Gentilly and Levy soils have a fine particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Balize soils are on low, broad, ponded, freshwater deltaic marshes at elevations of 1 foot or less.  They are flooded frequently with freshwater during high water levels from the Mississippi River and also during severe storms by sea water from the Gulf of Mexico.  These soils formed in fluid loamy sediments that were deposited under water and have never air-dried and consolidated.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  The mean air temperature is 70 degrees F. and the mean annual rainfall is about 60 inches near the type location."

Larose soils are in similar positions.  Bancker and Scatlake soils are in slightly lower positions.  Allemands and Clovelly soils have organic layers 16 to 51 inches thick and are in similar positions.  The Kenner and Lafitte soils have organic layers more than 51 inches thick and are in similar positions."
