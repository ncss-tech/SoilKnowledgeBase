  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are on flood plains, recent alluvial fans, and low stream terraces at elevations of 4,200 to 6,300 feet.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium dominantly from quartzite, sedimentary rocks, rhyolite, loessal materials, basalt, and soils formed therefrom. The climate is semiarid, with dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F. Average frost-free period is 80 to 126 days."

Bannock soils have no mottles or saturation with water above a depth of 40 inches.  Wardboro soils have loose sand and gravel at depths of less than 20 inches."
