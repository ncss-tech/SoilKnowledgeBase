  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackfoot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Blackfoot soils are on flood plains and very low terraces, and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation; is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
