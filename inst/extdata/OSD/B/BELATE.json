Closkey, Devils and Sumine soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Gowjai soils have bedrock at 100 to 150 cm and are 76 to 100 cm to base of the Bt horizon.  Granipeak soils have greater than 50 percent sand and rock fragments that are mainly stones and boulders.  Jivas soils have mollic epipedons that do not include part of the Bt horizon. Millan soils are 25 to 50 cm to the base of the Bt horizon and contains 50 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Torro soils have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in their control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belate soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on convex-shaped backslope or footslope positions.  They formed mainly in colluvium and residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff and andesite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,650 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
