  "OVERVIEW": "The Bergkeller series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils on transitional areas between outwash plains and end moraines.  They formed in loamy till and the underlying sandy and gravelly material.  They have moderate permeability in the upper part of the profile and rapid or very rapid permeability in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Gravel and cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the upper mantle and from 10 to 35 percent by volume in the 2Bt, 3BC and 3C horizons.  High value and high or low chroma mottles are in some profiles.\nThe 0 horizon typically consists of herbaceous material in various stages of decomposition, including Oi, Oe, or Oa horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nAn E horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay, 60 to 70 percent fine sand or coarser, and 15 to 45 percent coarse sand or coarser.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 3BC horizon has colors and textures similar to the 3C horizon.  High value and high or low chroma mottles are in some profiles.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  High value and high or low chroma mottles are in some profiles."
