  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 12 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days or more in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 25 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 20 percent are gravel and 0 to 5 percent are cobbles.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 80 to 100 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or gravelly loam."
