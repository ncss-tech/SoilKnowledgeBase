  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearbeach series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Bearbeach soils are on smooth to slightly concave positions on back swamps of lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 355 mm.",
