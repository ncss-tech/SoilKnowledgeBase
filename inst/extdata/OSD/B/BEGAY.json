Delvalle soils have loamy sand and coarse sand substratums. Ignacio, Ojito, and Turnback are moderately deep to bedrock. Kitsili soils are Inactive. Koshare soils contain 10 to 25 percent mica content in the coarse silt to fine sand fraction. Parida soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments and have 10YR hue. Ranchos soils attempt to reflect the effects of soil forming agents unique to the Great Plains. Remmit soils have hue 10YR and yellower in the Bw, Bk, and C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Begay soils occur on fan remanants, fan terraces, sand sheets on mesas, structural benches and broad mesa tops at elevations of 4,700 to 7,400 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in very deep eolian and alluvial deposits derived from sedimentary rock formations. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to  57 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 110 to 180 days."
