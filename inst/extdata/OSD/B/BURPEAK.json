  "OVERVIEW": "The Burpeak series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and colluvium with minor amounts of glacial till from volcanic rock.  These soil are on steep backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 65 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
