  "OVERVIEW": "The Behemotosh series consists of well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic bedrock.  Behemotosh soils are on uplands and have slopes of 8 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 to 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

Chromas are 2, 3 and 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  Texture ranges from gravelly sandy loam to loam, structure from weak granular to moderate subangular blocky, and reaction from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B1 horizon colors are very pale brown dry and brown moist.  Hues are 10YR dry and 7.5YR moist with values of 7 dry and 5 moist and chromas of 3 and 4 dry and 4 to 6 moist.  Textures are similar to the A horizon.\nThe B2t horizon colors are reddish yellow, strong brown and brownish yellow in 7.5YR and 10YR hues with values of 7 and 6 dry and 5 and 6 moist.  Chromas are 6 to 8 both dry and moist.  Texture ranges from very cobbly or very gravelly loam or clay loam; and in reaction from strongly acid to moderately acid."

The soils have very cobbly argillic horizons, ochric epipedons, and R layers at moderate depths.\nThis OSD was entered into the Ames data base on 01/2000. Only the format was adjusted to fit current standards. Competing series were not revised."
