Chromas are 2, 3 and 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  Texture ranges from gravelly sandy loam to loam, structure from weak granular to moderate subangular blocky, and reaction from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B1 horizon colors are very pale brown dry and brown moist.  Hues are 10YR dry and 7.5YR moist with values of 7 dry and 5 moist and chromas of 3 and 4 dry and 4 to 6 moist.  Textures are similar to the A horizon.\nThe B2t horizon colors are reddish yellow, strong brown and brownish yellow in 7.5YR and 10YR hues with values of 7 and 6 dry and 5 and 6 moist.

The soils occur at elevations of about 1,500 to 3,000 feet in a moist humid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 45 to 60 inches with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, average January temperature about 39 degrees F, and average July temperature about 75 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Behemotosh series was formerly classified in the Yellowish Brown Lateritic Group.  The soils have very cobbly argillic horizons, ochric epipedons, and R layers at moderate depths.\nThis OSD was entered into the Ames data base on 01/2000. Only the format was adjusted to fit current standards. Competing series were not revised.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
