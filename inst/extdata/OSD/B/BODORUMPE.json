    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 36 degrees to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. Depth to soft bedded shale is 20 to 40 inches. The soils commonly are noncalcareous.  Weak accumulation of calcium carbonates are found in a few pedons immediately above or within the upper part of the bedded shale. The control section is loamy fine sand or fine sand. It is neutral or mildly alkaline. The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR."

The Corlett soils are calcareous, have a high percentage of dark magnetic minerals and lack bedrock above 40 inches.  The Costilla and Space City soils have continuous horizon of secondary calcium carbonate and lack bedrock above 40 inches.  Cotopaxi soils lack bedrock above 40 inches."

Mean annual temperature is 34 degrees to 45 degrees F. Precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,000 feet. The growing season is 83 to 110 days, but frost may occur in any month."
