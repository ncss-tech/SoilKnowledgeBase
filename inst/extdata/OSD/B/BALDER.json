  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil are usually moist but dry throughout the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice in more than 7 out of 10 years. Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. The solum has 18 to 27 percent clay. Rock fragments in the solum range from about 5 to 35 percent. Surface stones range from very few to 3 percent of the surface covered. Free carbonates occur as coatings on the lower side of rock fragments and on the surface of the bedrock in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  The solum has 20 to 30 percent glass and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.15 to 0.30 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has weak or moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure.  It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel."

The soils formed in colluvium mixed with ash over volcanic tuff. The climate is subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 14 to 18 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the average January temperature is about 30 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
