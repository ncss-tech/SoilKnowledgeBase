  "OVERVIEW": "The Buhler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable, sodic soils formed in alluvium on floodplains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters), and the mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",
