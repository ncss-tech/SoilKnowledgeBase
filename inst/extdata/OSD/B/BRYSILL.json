These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 100 to 120 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches and includes the argillic horizon.  The upper 11 to 18 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, glass content of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.25 to 0.4 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 25 to 30 percent clay and 40 to 80 percent rock fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent in the A or Ap horizons.  Depth to 2Bt horizon is 11 to 18 inches.  Depth to 3C horizon is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizons  have value of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe BA horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is very gravelly ashy loam, extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam, very cobbly ashy loam, gravelly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.
