  "OVERVIEW": "The Baberwit series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite with a component of calcareous loess.  The soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
