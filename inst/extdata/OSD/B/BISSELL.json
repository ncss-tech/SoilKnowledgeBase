Bjork, Does, Indiano, Madras, Noslo, Pahrange, Quiero, Shoebend, Simcoe and Uhaldi soils have bedrock above a depth of 40 inches. Cowiche soils have a 2Bk horizon with carbonate accumulation and lack mica throughout. Fernpoint soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and carbonate accumulation at 40 to 50 inches. Hullsgulch soils have continuous lamellae (E&Bt horizons). Jerusalem soils are more than 60 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some part. Margerum soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, dominantly pumice in the control section. Orr soils average less than 25 percent clay in the control section. Quailridge soils have continuous lamellae (E&Bt horizons) and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Ralls soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and have moderately or strongly alkaline C horizons. Springmeyer soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, and lack mica throughout. Wenatchee soils have 5 to 15 percent rock fragments in the control section and lack mica throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bissell soils are nearly level to moderately sloping on fan remnants, relict alluvial fans, and stream terraces at elevations of 2,100 to 3,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in alluvium with significant amounts of mica and feldspar dominantly from granitic rocks mixed with minor amounts of alluvium from volcaniclastic sediments and other igneous rocks. The average annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches. The average annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 155 days."
