Deseret and Kanosh soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are influenced with gypsum.  Duggins soils do not have a mollic epipedon and contain more than 35 percent clay.  Heist soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are well drained."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.5 and 3 feet (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between April and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between year-round."
