  "OVERVIEW": "The Beancreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or eolian deposits.  Beancreek soils are on fan remnants, mountain slopes and dunes. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
