  "OVERVIEW": "The Belton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey till or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on moraines, dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, escarpments and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
