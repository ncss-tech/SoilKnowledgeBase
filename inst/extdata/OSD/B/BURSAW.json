  "OVERVIEW": "The Bursaw series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in gravelly deposits over dense till on lake beach ridges. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the gravelly materials and low in the loamy materials.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
