  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowman series is a member of the coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed (calcareous), mesic family of Typic Haplaquolls.  Typically, Bowman soils have a dark gray calcareous silt loam Ap or A1 horizon and a light gray, mottled, calcareous loam C1cag horizon over loamy fine sand at a depth of 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches range from 68 degrees to 73 degrees F. The soils are saturated at some period when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. or are artificially drained. The upper part of the 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly loam with less than 18 percent clay.  Depth to loose noncalcareous sand, loamy sand or gravelly sand is less than 40 inches and is commonly about 30 inches. The upper part of the profile is moderately or weakly calcareous and the lower part is less calcareous or commonly noncalcareous. The organic carbon content is about 3 to 5 percent in the Ap horizon and it decreases regularly as depth increases. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The Ap horizon or the upper 7 inches when mixed ranges from 10YR 5/2 to 2.5Y 4/1 dry and from 10YR 3/2 to 2.5Y 2/1 moist. In some pedons, it contains segregations of lime. This horizon has moderate granular to weak subangular blocky structure. Distinct or prominent mottles related to wetness are in the lower part of the mollic epipedon or immediately below it. The horizon below the mollic epipedon has chroma of 2 or less in the matrix. Though dominantly loam between depths of 10 and 30 inches, some pedons have a thin layer of silt loam or moderately coarse or moderately fine texture. The C1cag horizon has weak coarse prismatic structure or is massive and it is friable or firm."

Baldock soils lack a mollic epipedon. Balm soils lack an aquic moisture regime or the colors associated with wetness of the Aquolls. Black Canyon soils have a strongly contrasting clayey over loamy control section. Catherine, Draper, and Wingville soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 24 inches and lack strongly contrasting textures in the control section.  Gannett, Gilford, Hanska, Jubilee, McBeth, and Pajaro soils lack strongly contrasting textures in the control section and Gannett, Gilford, Hanska, Moulton, and St. Joe soils have dominantly moderately coarse textures in the upper part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Bowman soils are in level or nearly level stream bottoms, alluvial fans, lake basins or very low terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. Some areas are channelled and many are swales or depressions. The soils formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits from mixed sources but mostly from acid igneous rocks. The climate is semiarid and has dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 15 inches including 1 to 3 feet of snowfall. Mean freeze-free period is 115 to 152 days."
