  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beckwourth soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  These formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,350 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches much of which falls as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 49 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table within 3 feet of the soil surface (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between March and May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round or occasional flooding for brief periods between January and May."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 23 to 34 inches (Btk horizon).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 23 to 60 inches (Btk, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 36 and 40 inches from March through May during normal years (parts of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 23 to 34 inches (Btk horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), as soil survey sample number S61CA-063-015 (pedon # 40A3022).  Laboratory data shows the organic matter content to be marginal in the A2 horizon for a mollic epipedon.  Data from other pedons in the same vicinity indicate organic matter is more than 1 percent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
