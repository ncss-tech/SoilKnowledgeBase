  "OVERVIEW": "The Beckwourth series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Beckwourth soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Laboratory data shows the organic matter content to be marginal in the A2 horizon for a mollic epipedon.  Data from other pedons in the same vicinity indicate organic matter is more than 1 percent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
