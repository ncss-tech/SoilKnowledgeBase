Aquic conditions with redox depletions and concentrations or masses occur at depths of less than 14 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. The solum is extremely acid through strongly acid. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR and value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bw or Bg horizon and BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3, 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has distinct to prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, but thin lenses of finer material are in some pedons.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 10Y, value of 2.5 to 5 moist, 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to neutral. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 27 to 50 percent clay. There are few strata of coarser textures in some pedons. It is extremely acid through moderately."

The soils formed in silty mixed recent alluvium derived from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks. Water ponds in winter after heavy rains or when streams overflow leaving thin layers of fresh alluvium on the surface. The soils are characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The average January temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 58 to 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 300 days. This soil is on the Ingram geomorphic surface."
