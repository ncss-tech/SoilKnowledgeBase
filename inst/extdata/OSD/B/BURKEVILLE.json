  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Burkeville series consists of very deep, well poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in weakly consolidated, calcareous clays and marls of the Coastal Plain.  These soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping uplands.  Water runs off the surface at a rapid rate.  Slopes are dominantly 3 to 6 percent, but range from 1 to 15 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particles-size control section ranges from 60 to 70 percent.  When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks remain open from 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and wedge-shaped peds begin at a depth of 5 to 24 inches.  Undistributed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls about 4 to 18 inches above the microdepressions.  Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from 8 to 20 feet.  Colors with chroma of 2 or less in the subsoil are considered to be litho-chromic.  Mottles with chroma of 3 or more, or redox concentrations, are considered to be relic or litho-chromic.\nThe A has colors of gray or brown in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y with value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  When A horizon has color values less than 3.5, the thickness is less than 12 inches.\nThe Bk horizon has colors of gray and brown in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y and 5Y with value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Distinct mottles of light yellowish brown, olive yellow, and yellow range from few to common.\nThe Bss horizon has color of gray, brown, olive, and yellow hue of 2.5Y and 5Y with value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 3.  This horizon has mottles of reddish gray, olive yellow, light yellowish brown, and brownish yellow ranging from few to common.  Slickensides range from many in the upper part to few in the lower part of this horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burkeville soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping uplands.  Slopes are mainly 3 to 6 percent but range from 1 to 15 percent.  Most areas are under active erosion with V-shaped gullies 0.5 to 8 feet deep.  These soils formed in weakly consolidated clays and marls of Tertiary age, mainly of the Fleming formation.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 48 to 55 inches and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."

Woodville soils have an argillic horizon and are on nearby landscapes.  Redco soils are on similar topography.  Wiergate soils are closely associated on the landscapes and have thicker darker surfaces."
