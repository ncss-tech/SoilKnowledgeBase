  "OVERVIEW": "The Becks series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Becks soils are on fans and low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  All horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The 10- to 40-inch control section on a weighted average is less than 18 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments are rounded and dominantly less than 6 inches in diameter.  Hue ranges from 7.5YR through 2.5Y in all horizons.\nThe Bw and C horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  The Bw horizon is very gravelly sandy clay loam, but ranges to very gravelly loam and very gravelly sandy loam."
