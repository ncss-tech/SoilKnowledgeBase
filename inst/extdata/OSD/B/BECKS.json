Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  All horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The 10- to 40-inch control section on a weighted average is less than 18 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments are rounded and dominantly less than 6 inches in diameter.  Hue ranges from 7.5YR through 2.5Y in all horizons.\nThe Bw and C horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  The Bw horizon is very gravelly sandy clay loam, but ranges to very gravelly loam and very gravelly sandy loam."
