  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowstring series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in highly decomposed organic soil material that is stratified with thin layers of sandy or loamy material.  They are on flood plains in glacial moraines, glacial outwash plains, and glacial lake plains. These soils have rapid to moderately slow permeability.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Organic soil material extends from 16 inches to depths greater than 51 inches.  Thin layers of mineral soil material are within the organic material.  Herbaceous material is dominant, but woody material constitutes nearly 50 percent in some pedons.  Content of woody fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent.   The organic soil material typically is sapric, but some pedons have hemic layers up to 10 inches cumulative thickness in the control section.  Depth to the C horizon commonly is 24 to 40 inches but ranges from 2 to 48 inches.  Reaction for the series ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline (pH 5.6 to 8.4 in water).\nThe Oa and O'a horizons (sapric material) have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral with value of 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand; but all sandy or loamy textures are within the range.  In some pedons the C horizon is stratified.  Thin subhorizons in a few pedons have a high concentration of free carbonates."

Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in organic soil material greater than 51 inches thick which has one or more thin sandy or loamy alluvial strata.  The organic material is derived primarily from herbaceous material but woody fragments are included.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."

Graycalm, Menahga, and Zimmerman soils are all better drained and formed in sandy glacial outwash on adjacent upland landscapes.  Lupton and Mooselake soils are in adjacent wooded bogs.  The well drained Nebish soils and well drained and moderately well drained Warba soils are fine-loamy.  Pengilly and Winterfield soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits."

The apparent seasonal high water table is +1.0 to 0.5 feet at some time during October to June in most years.  It is rare to frequently flooded for brief to long durations during the period of March through June in most years, and at other times following periods of intense rains."
