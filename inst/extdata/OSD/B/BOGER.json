  "OVERVIEW": "The Boger series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt with a component of loess and volcanic ash. The Boger soils are on basalt plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
