The solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches thick an depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 100 inches or more. The control section contains 12 to 18 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. The amount of rock fragments increases with depth and may be greater than 50 percent below a depth of 40 inches. The soils are moderately or strongly acid. Base saturation is less than 50 percent throughout the profile.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, a value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. it has weak or moderate fine or very fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is gravelly or very gravelly loam."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from dacite tuffs, andesites, diorites, and other intermediate igneous rocks. The climate is subhumid having a mean annual precipitation of 50 to 70 inches. This occurs as rain in the spring and fall, and snow and rain in the winter. The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 50 to 64 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 40 to 80 days."
