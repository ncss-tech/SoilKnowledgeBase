These soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders over material weathered from granodiorite or rhyolite.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 to 30 inches; the mean annual temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is about 160 to 200 days."
