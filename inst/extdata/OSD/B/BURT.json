  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. LWB-NWS-LMC",
  "REVDATE": "07/2004",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Burt series consists of poorly drained soils shallow to sandstone. They formed in sandy deposits weathered from the sandstone. Permeability is rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The pedon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Rock fragments consisting mainly of sandstone, pebbles, channers, and flags range from 0 to 30 percent.  Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 2 or 3; chroma of 0 or 1.  It is mucky fine sand, mucky sand, mucky loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, or channery analogues of these textures."
