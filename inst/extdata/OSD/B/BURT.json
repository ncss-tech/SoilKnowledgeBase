Rock fragments consisting mainly of sandstone, pebbles, channers, and flags range from 0 to 30 percent.  Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 2 or 3; chroma of 0 or 1.  It is mucky fine sand, mucky sand, mucky loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, or channery analogues of these textures."
