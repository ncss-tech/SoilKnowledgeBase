  "OVERVIEW": "The Bisoodi series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from calcareous sandstone and limestone.  Bisoodi soils are on broad undulating plateaus with slopes of 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F.",
