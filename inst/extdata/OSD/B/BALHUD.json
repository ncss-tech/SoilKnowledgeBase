  "OVERVIEW": "The Balhud series consists of shallow, well drained soils. These soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and/or shale. Balhud soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 centimeters (10 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17.8 degrees C. (64 degrees F.).",
