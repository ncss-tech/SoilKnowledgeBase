    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 44 inches. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments of limestone, shale, siltstone and sandstone range from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the A and B horizons and 20 to 60 percent in the C horizon.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and upper part of the Bt horizon; moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the B horizon; and moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the C horizon.  Stones cover 0 to 3 percent of the soil surface.  This soil has moderate shrink-swell potential.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Ap horizon is 4 to 9 inches thick and has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam, with or without thin subhorizons of silty clay.  The B horizon has moderate or strong, fine to coarse subangular or angular blocky structure.  BC horizon, where present has with similar colors and textures.\nThe C horizon has colors that are similar to that of the B horizon.  Textures are silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay."

The Belmore, Chili, and Kendalville soils have waterworn gravels throughout. Crouse soils has a lithic contact at greater than 80 inches. The Cliftycreek Greybrook and Riddles soil series are greater than 60 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. Gallman, Richland, and Skelton soils have thicker sola.  Relay soils have Bt2 horizons with hues of 10YR or yellower.  Kidder soils have free carbonates in the series control section.  High Gap, and Military soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Kanawha soils have coarse fragments of gravel size and have formed in alluvial materials.  Leroy and Strawm soils have thinner sola.  The Martinsville soils formed in calcareous stratified silt, sandy and clayey materials.  The (T) Pignut soils are formed in residuum from greenstone or greenstone schist. Riddles soils have more sand in the control section.  Skelton soils have sola thicker than 44 inches.  Ockley soils have rock fragments of water worn gravels in the lower part of the sola.  Lumberton soils formed in loess or outwash over limestone residuum. Princeton soils formed in coarse silt and fine sand of Aeolian origin.  The (T) Turnersburg soils are formed in residuum from igneous or metamorphic rock. Woodbine soils have an upper solum formed in loess and glacial till and a lower solum formed in weathered residuum of limestone."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belmont soils are gently sloping to very steep soils on benches and side slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered mainly from limestone with some interbedding of shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  Bedrock outcrops are common in some areas.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 55 inches, and a mean annual temperature of 47 to 59 degrees F."

The Berks, Calvin, and Dekalb soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, base saturation less than 35 percent, and lack argillic horizons.
