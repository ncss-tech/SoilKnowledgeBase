  "OVERVIEW": "The Beaubien series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sand deposits of mostly Holocene age. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on sandsheets leeward of large drainages and river valleys within the Canadian Plateaus LRU of MLRA 70A. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual soil temperature is 11.6 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 420 mm (16 in).",

They have a pachic mollic epipedon.\nPhilmont soils are also on the plateau interfluve but are not formed in a sand sheet and therefore have fine textures in the control section with sand contents below 50 percent.\nSeelez soils form on plateau interfluves in sand sheets that are still somewhat active and therefore have not formed an argillic horizon."
