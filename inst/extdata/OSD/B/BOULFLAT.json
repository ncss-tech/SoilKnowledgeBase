  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boulflat soils are on mountain and hill crests and side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, shale, quartzite and andesite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
