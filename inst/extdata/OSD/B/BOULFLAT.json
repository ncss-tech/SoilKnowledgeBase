  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boulflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, shale, quartzite and andesite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  The Boulflat soils are on mountain and hill crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
