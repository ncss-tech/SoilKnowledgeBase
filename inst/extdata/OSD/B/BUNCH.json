  "OVERVIEW": "The Bunch series consists of deep and very deep to hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 50 to 100 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 150 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
