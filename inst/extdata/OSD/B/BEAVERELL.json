  "OVERVIEW": "The Beaverell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or glacial outwash that is 10 to 20 inches deep over very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces, kames, eskers and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0178, MT1030.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 11 inches (A, Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - from 8 to 11 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nHorizon of carbonate accumulation (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - from 11 to 17 inches (2Bk1) and likely from 11 to 60 inches (2Bk1 and 2Bk2)\nSandy-skeletal material - from 17 to 60 inches (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - from 3 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons).\nBeaverell soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nThe 6/2012 revision reflects a reclassification from Aridic Argiustolls to Calcidic Argiustolls because the 2Bk1 horizon meets the criteria for a calcic horizon.  A check of NASIS data shows that component data as populated for Bk horizons also consistently meets criteria for a calcic horizon.  Classifications of Beaverell components in all survey areas should be reviewed as part of a future update project.  The 2Bk2 horizon at the type location should be investigated to determine if it is part of the calcic horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
