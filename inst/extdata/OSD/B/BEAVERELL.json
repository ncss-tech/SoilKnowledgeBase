    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0178, MT1030.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 11 inches (A, Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - from 8 to 11 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nHorizon of carbonate accumulation (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - from 11 to 17 inches (2Bk1) and likely from 11 to 60 inches (2Bk1 and 2Bk2)\nSandy-skeletal material - from 17 to 60 inches (2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - from 3 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons).\nBeaverell soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nThe 6/2012 revision reflects a reclassification from Aridic Argiustolls to Calcidic Argiustolls because the 2Bk1 horizon meets the criteria for a calcic horizon.  A check of NASIS data shows that component data as populated for Bk horizons also consistently meets criteria for a calcic horizon.  Classifications of Beaverell components in all survey areas should be reviewed as part of a future update project.  The 2Bk2 horizon at the type location should be investigated to determine if it is part of the calcic horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
