  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellyspring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone. Bellyspring soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The annual precipitation is about 254 millimeters (10 inches) and the annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
