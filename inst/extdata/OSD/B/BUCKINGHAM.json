  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches. Depth to Bedrock is greater than 80 inches. Depth to the fragipan is 20 to 40 inches. Redox depletions and/or iron concentrations are under the A or Ap horizon. Content of clay in the control section is 14 to 34 percent. Rock fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the surface, 2 to 14 percent in the upper solum, 5 to 20 percent in the fragipan. Content of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent. Kind of rock fragments are metamorphic and sedimentary shale, siltstone, and sandstone, channers and gravel in the solum, gravels and cobbles in the lower solum. In Unlimed areas, soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum, and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Ap horizon (if it occurs) has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is prismatic parting to parting to platy or subangular blocky. Consistence is very firm and brittle.\nThe C horizon (if it occurs) has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Abbottstown, Gresham, Portville, Ravenna, and Venango soils are in the same family. Abbottstown, Gresham, Ravenna, and Venango soils have solum less than 60 inches. Abbottstown soils have redder hues. Gresham and Ravenna soils have hues 10YR or yellower. Venango soils lack a Bt horizon above the fragipan.\nThe Canfield, Frenchtown, Platea, and Wadsworth series are in the related family. Canfield and Platea soils formed in Wisconsin age till on till plains and moraines. Canfield soils lack ped faces with dominant chromas of 2 or less in the argillic horizon and Platea soils lack an argillic horizon above the fragipan and have finesilty control section. Frenchtown and Wadsworth soils formed in loamy Wisconsin age till on till plains.  Frenchtown soils have matrix colors with chromas of 2 or less dominant above the fragipan and Wadsworth soils have fine-silty textural control sections with 27 to 35 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buckingham soils are at heads of drains and along drainageways in the Northern piedmont Province. The soils are on concave toe slopes and in depressions. They are formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from weathered gray and red metamorphic shale, siltstone, and sandstone materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 42 to 45 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 63 degrees F. The frost-free days range from 155 to 190."
