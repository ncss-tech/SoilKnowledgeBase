The Kolberg soils are nearby in better drained positions where the argillic horizon averages more than 35 percent clay. The Longrie soils are also nearby in better drained positions, but are coarse-loamy. The Namur soils are nearby where the depth to bedrock is less than 31 cm (12 inches)."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the till and ranges from moderately low to high (0.42 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the bedrock. Permeability is moderate in the till and ranges from moderate to slow in the bedrock. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) for some time in most years"

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas of this soil have  been cleared and are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grains and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland or woodland. Native vegetation is commonly mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are quacking aspen, paper birch, red maple, and some northern white-cedar."
