Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to the buried profile ranges from 20 to 35 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid throughout.  The particle-size control sectin is ashy over ashy-pumiceous over medial.

These soils formed in layers of aerially deposited dacitic pumice and volcanic ash from Mt.  St. Helens.  Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the stratigraphy of Mt. St. Helens pyroclastic material in Benham soil profiles is (1) \"Layer T\" ash and pumice about 176-years old, (2) \"Layer W\" pumice of about 300-year age, (3) \"Layer P\" ash and pumice of undefined age, and (4) \"Layer Y\" pumice of about 3,200-year age.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summer and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches including snowfall.  Mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  Growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 180 days."

The particle-size control section is from the mineral soil surface to 40 inches and qualifies as a contrasting particle-size class.  From 9 to 27 inches qualifies as ashy-pumiceous and from 27 to 40 inches qualifies as medial.  More investigation is needed to confirm the medial classificaiton of the \"P\" tephra set.\nClassification changed 6/98 based on Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
