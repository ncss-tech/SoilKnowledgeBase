The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to about November (about 150 to 200 days).  The particle-size control section averages 22 to 29 percent clay and 35 to 65 percent rock fragments, mostly cobbles.  Mineralogy is mixed.  Base saturation by sum of the cations ranges from 4 to 7 percent.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the bedrock and the surface of the soil from November through April.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 10 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly loam or cobbly loam.  Clay content ranges from 14 to 22 percent.
