  "OVERVIEW": "The Beatsonhollow series consists of shallow, poorly drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basalt.  Beatsonhollow soils are in swales on tops of basalt plateaus in volcanic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, (889 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
