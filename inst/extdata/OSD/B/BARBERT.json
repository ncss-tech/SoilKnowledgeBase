  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates range from 35 to 75 inches.  The solum and C horizon do not have rock fragments except where there are IIB or IIC horizons in glacial till.  The upper part of the argillic horizon (below the albic horizon) qualifies as part of the mollic epipedon.\nThe A or Ap horizons have value of 2 or 3.  Value is commonly 2 or 3 units higher when dry.  It has weak or moderate, platy, granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe E horizons have a matrix with dominant values of 4 or 5.   Mottles are in this horizon in some pedons.  Also, coatings on peds or inclusions of material with a value of 3 are in this horizon in some pedons.  It has moderate or strong, very thin through moderately thick platy structure.\nThe A and E horizons are silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is friable or very friable and ranges from strongly to slightly acid.\nThe Btg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5 with the lower values mostly in the upper part.  High chroma mottles are in part to all of the B horizon.  The upper part of the Btg horizon is clay or silty clay with sand content less than 10 percent and clay content of 45 to 60 percent.  The lower part of the Btg horizons is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Primary structure is moderate or strong, fine to coarse prismatic.  Secondary structure is moderate or strong, fine or very fine angular blocky.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part.  A BC horizon as much as 15 inches thick is in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  A 2BC or 2C horizon of loam or clay loam glacial till begins at depths as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons.  It has 2 to 10 percent of rock fragments."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chauncey, Edina, Fillmore, Goose Lake, Massie, Plankinton, Rolfe, Scott, and Sperry series.  The Chauncey soils have E horizons greater than 14 inches thick, less than 45 percent clay in the argillic horizons and have greater than 32 inches precipitation.  The Edina series has precipitation greater than 32 inches, annual temperature greater than 49 degrees F, and formed in loess.  The Fillmore series has annual temperatures greater than 50 degrees F, and are formed in loess.  The Goose Lake series are drier for more than 120 days following the summer solstice.  The Massie series has precipitation less than 26 inches, annual temperature greater than 50 degrees F, argillic horizons as thick as 64 inches, and are formed in loess.  The Plankinton series has less than 22 inches of annual precipitation, has a Bk horizon and have A horizons less than 6 inches thick.  The Rolfe series has less than 45 percent clay in argillic horizon and has up to 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic.  The Scott series has annual temperature greater than 50 degrees F, annual precipitation as low as 16 inches, and an E horizon 5 inches or less thick.  The Sperry series has less than 45 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and are formed in loess."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barbert soils have plane or slightly concave slopes of less than 1 percent in small, slightly inset depressions and in long, slightly inset, low gradient, drainageways on glacial lake plains.  Individual bodies of this soil are as much as 20 acres in size but principally they are in areas of 1/5 to 5 acres in size and are mapped in complexes with their associated soils.  They formed in clayey lacustrine sediments that are 3 1/2 to 10 feet or more thick.  These sediments are of the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  They commonly overlie glacial till.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 32 inches.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 1300 feet above sea level.  Frost-free days range from 124 to 172."

These soils formed in sediments similar to those of Barbert soils and are in the same drainage sequence.  The Madelia, Kingston, Marna, and Guckeen soils are associates in a few landscapes."
