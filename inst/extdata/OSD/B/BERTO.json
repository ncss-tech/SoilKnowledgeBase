  "OVERVIEW": "The Berto series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in windblown sediments derived from basalt and sandstone.  Berto soils are on basalt-capped mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
