  "OVERVIEW": "The Bartonhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on outwash fan and draws.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid over very rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
