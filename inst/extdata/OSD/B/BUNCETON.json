  "OVERVIEW": "The Bunceton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum from cherty limestone. Permeability is moderately slow. These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 14 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",
