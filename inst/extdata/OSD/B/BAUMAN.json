  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to weathered granite grus ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control ranges from 30 to 35 percent.  Coarse fragments range from a few pebbles in some surface horizons to about 35 percent with depth.  The coarse fragments consist of angular fragments of quartz and feldspar.  Exchangeable sodium in the natric horizon ranges from 15 to 30 percent within 16 inches of the upper boundary of the Bt horizon.  The EC ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos/cm at a depth of 30 inches or more.  Some pedons contain one or more lithologic discontinuities based on coarse sand to fine sand ratios.\nRedox features, where present, are considered relict.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam with coarse and very coarse sand content ranging from 5 to 15 percent.  Coarse fragments range from a few to 10 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon is 1 or 2 units higher in value than the A horizon.  Coarse fragments range from few to 10 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redox features range from none to common in shades of gray, brown or olive.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam or their gravelly conterparts.  Reaction is neutral or slightly  alkaline.\nThe Btkn horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.   Calcium carbonate in the form of soft masses and concretions range from 2 to 5 percent.  Gypsum and other salts range from a few crystals to about 5 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cr consists of weathered, finely fractured granite grus (saprolite).  Colors are variable.  The materials have granite structure with nearly all natural surfaces having clay coatings.  The grus becomes more compact and less weathered with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bauman soils are in shallow narrow valleys, swales, or slight depressions in undulating or rolling uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in colluvium and residuum from granite or gneiss.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 1,100 to 2,000 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 38 to 44."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Castell, Click, Katemcy, Keese, Lou and Voca soils.  All of these soils are on higher sideslopes or are on ridges and lack a natric horizon.  Castell and Katemcy soils have a fine control section.  Click soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Keese soils lack a Bt horizon  and are less than 20 inches thick over granite.  Lou soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Voca soils have a fine textured control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Permeability is slow.  Runoff is low.  These soils have a  perched water table above the natric horizon and/or above the granite grus bedrock during unusually wet years for 4 to 10 weeks in duration.  Typically, there are one to three wet years in a ten year period."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used entirely for native range.  Grasses are mainly buffalograss, purple threeawn, and tumble windmillgrass.  Woody vegetation consists of mesquite, live oak, post oak, pricklypear, tasajillo, and lotebush."
