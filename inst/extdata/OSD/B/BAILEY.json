  "OVERVIEW": "The Bailey series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from rhyolite and tuff with loess influence.  Bailey soils are on canyon walls and have slopes of 4 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7.5 degrees C.",
