  "OVERVIEW": "The Buttermilk series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable saline soils on stream terraces in the Central Red Rolling Prairies (MLRA 80A).  They formed in silty alluvium.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 14.4 degrees C (58 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 762 mm (30 in).",
