  "OVERVIEW": "The Brandt series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty materials overlying sand and gravel on outwash plains.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid or rapid in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

In some counties this soil has been correlated as Estelline deep."
