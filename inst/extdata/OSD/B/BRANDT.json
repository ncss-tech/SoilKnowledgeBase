    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 20 to 48 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Clay content of the control section averages as low as 25 percent in some pedons and as high as 35 percent in others.  The particle size control section has an irregular fine sand distribution and contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 (2 or 3 moist) and chroma of 2 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 (2 to 5 moist) and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 (4 or 5 moist) and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have C horizons with colors of the Bk horizon.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Bk has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 6 (4 to 5 moist) and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly clay loam.

Kranzburg soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle size control section.  Poinsett soils have fine strata of very fine sand, fine sand, and clay in the lower part of the series control section. Putney soils have gypsum and other salts within a depth of 20 inches  In addition, Great Bend, Kranzburg, Poinsett, and Putney soils do not have a 2Bk horizon that has more than 15 percent gravel."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 15 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons);  cambic horizon - the zone from about 15 inches to a depth of about 34 inches (Bw2 and Bw3 horizons). In some counties this soil has been correlated as Estelline deep.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
