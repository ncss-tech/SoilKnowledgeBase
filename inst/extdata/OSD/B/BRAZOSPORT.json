    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Mustang series. The series was separated based on differences in water table depth, and salinity.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (A horizon)\nEndosaturation and aquic conditions: 37 to 203 cm (15 to 80 in) (C2,Cg,2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: 115 to 203 cm (45 to 80 in).\nAdditional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity is evident as an increase in clay due to the Beaumont Formation and ancient Brazos River. This paleo-surface is deeper in pedons on Galveston Island and shallower on the southwest end of Follets Island.\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU soil characterization lab data from a representative location S95TX167001. MLRA Soil Survey Office data are available on location S2020TX0397031 at the series type location.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
