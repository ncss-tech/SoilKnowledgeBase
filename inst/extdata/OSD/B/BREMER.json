  "OVERVIEW": "The Bremer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces on floodplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 83 centimeters (33 inches).",
