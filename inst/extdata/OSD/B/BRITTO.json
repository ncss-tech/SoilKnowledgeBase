  "OVERVIEW": "The Britto series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils with high concentrations of salt and alkali in the lower horizons.  These soils are in the valley basin rim and formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from sedimentary sources.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
