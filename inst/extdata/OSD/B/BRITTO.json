The water table ranges from a depth 12 to 36 inches October through March.  The soil temperature reflects the water temperature when inundated.  The soil temperature is warmer than 47 degrees F. from February 15 to December 1.\nThe A horizon ranges from 27 to 35 percent clay content.  The E horizon ranges from 27 to 30 percent clay content.  The Btn horizon ranges from 35 to 55 percent clay content and has at least 8 percent clay (absolute) more than the A horizon.  The EC of the profile ranges from 2 to 20 mmhos/cm.
