  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluewing series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Bluewing soils are on fan remnants, beach plains, alluvial fans, and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Inmo soils have a 2 to 4 percent finely divided mica and gravel that are dominantly less than 10 mm in diameter.  Inmo and Willwood soils lack Bk horizons.  Itme soils are moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer and have rock fragments that are dominantly 2 to 5 mm in diameter.  Izamatch soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following summer convection storms.  Izo and Willwood soils are usually dry in the lower part of the moisture control section throughout the year. Ioka, Izo and Leo soils are moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days during the period July to September following convection storms and lack Bk horizons.  Leo soils also have strata of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the control section.  Nepalto soils are stratified and have irregular decrease in organic matter.  Wardenot soils have a subhorizon with silica coatings and pendants."

Slopes are 0 to 8 percent but are as high as 30 percent on side slopes of highly dissected fan remnants.  Elevations range from 910 to 1,950 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
