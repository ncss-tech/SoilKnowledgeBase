  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 5 to 10 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees F to 72 degrees F. These soils are usually dry; they are moist for short periods during the winter and summer months, but are dry in the spring and fall. These soils are calcareous throughout, and are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe A1 horizon is covered by a gravel erosion pavement containing 50 to 80 percent 1/2 to 3 inch pebbles. Few cobbles may occur. It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. It is gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Coarse fragments average about 35 to 55 percent, consisting mainly of pebbles but including up to 15 percent cobbles. Fine salt and gypsum segregations occur in some pedons but are not diagnostic of the series.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures are normally stratified ranging from very or extremely gravelly, or very, or extremely cobbly sand or loamy sand. Thin strata, up to 4 inches thick, of very gravelly sandy loam occur in some pedons. Coarse fragments range from 50 to 80 percent. Lime coatings are on coarse fragments and sand grains in the upper part. The horizon may also contain salt and gypsum segregations."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bitter Spring, Bitter, Pinaleno, Chuckawalla, Cristobal, and Pinant series in other families. Bitter, Bitter Spring, and Pinaleno soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. In addition Bitter and Pinaleno soils have 10 to 30 inch thick sola, and Pinaleno soils are also noncalcareous in the A and upper Bt horizons and are slightly acid to mildly alkaline to a depth of 12 inches. Chuckawalla, Cristobal, and Pinant soils have temperatures warmer than 72 F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blackmount soils are on old dissected alluvial fans, between more recent alluvial fans and the toe slopes of steep and very steep hills and mountains at elevations of 2,500 to 3,600 feet. Slopes are dominantly 1 to 5 percent, but range up to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from a wide variety of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks including schist, granite , quartzite, gneiss, andesite, rhyolite, limestone, and other related rocks. The climate is hot and arid with a mean annual temperature of 65 degrees to 70 degrees F., average January temperature of 45 degrees to 51 degrees F, and average July temperature of 82 degrees to 92 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches."

Arizo, Nickel, Cave, and Bluepoint soils lack an argillic horizon. Arizo soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Nickel soils have a calcic horizon, Cave soils have an indurated petrocalcic horizon. Bluepoint soils have a sandy particle-size control section."
