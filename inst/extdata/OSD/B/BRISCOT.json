Briscot soils occur in a humid climate with an average January temperature of 38 degrees F.; average July temperature is 64 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 210 days.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 55 inches, most of which falls as rain during the winter months.  Each of the summer months generally has at least 1 inch of rainfall.  Snow is infrequent."
