  "OVERVIEW": "The Breitenbach series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium on fans and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in  the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 20  percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
