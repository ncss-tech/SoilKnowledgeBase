  "STATES": "NM,OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Berthoud series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium or colluvium of Tertiary age.  These very gently sloping to strongly sloping soils are on convex foot slopes and alluvial fans usually just below the caprock in the Southern High Plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 inches and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F.",

In addition Mcrae soils have an argillic horizon.  Cibeque and Kachina soils are dry in May and June.  Coconio soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Sixmile soils have a paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Teromote and Ziggy have mean annual soil temperatures of 47 to 51 degrees F, and are typically drier in the spring"

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Berthoud soils are mainly on foot slopes and alluvial fans.  Slopes are mainly 1 to 8 percent, but range from 1 to 12 percent.  The parent material consists of calcareous, loamy sediments, mainly of slope-alluvium or colluvium from the Ogallala formation of Tertiary age.  The climate is semiarid to dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches; Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 24 to 34; mean annual temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 57 degrees F."
