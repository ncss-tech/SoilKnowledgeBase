In addition Mcrae soils have an argillic horizon.  Cibeque and Kachina soils are dry in May and June.  Coconio soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Sixmile soils have a paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Teromote and Ziggy have mean annual soil temperatures of 47 to 51 degrees F, and are typically drier in the spring"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Berthoud soils are mainly on foot slopes and alluvial fans.  Slopes are mainly 1 to 8 percent, but range from 1 to 12 percent.  The parent material consists of calcareous, loamy sediments, mainly of slope-alluvium or colluvium from the Ogallala formation of Tertiary age.  The climate is semiarid to dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches; Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 24 to 34; mean annual temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 57 degrees F."

Carnero, Mansic, Mansker, and Manzano soils have a mollic epipedon.  Pastura and Potter soils are shallow and have an aridic moisture regime.
