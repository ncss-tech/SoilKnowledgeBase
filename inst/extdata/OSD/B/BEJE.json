  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beje series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone. These soils are on ridges, structural benches, cuestas, mesas, hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
