    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum over limestone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon is dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 3/3), reddish brown (5YR 4/2, 4/3), and dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2).  Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay loam or loam.  Coarse fragments of chert or limestone from 1/2 to 8 inches in diameter across the long axis comprise 15 to 50 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon is red (2.5YR 4/6), dark red (2.5YR 3/6), dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4), and reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/4).  The fine earth fraction is clay with a clay content of 40 to 60 percent.  Coarse fragments of chert or limestone from 1/2 to 8 inches in diameter across the long axis comprise 15 to 34 percent by volume.  Some pedons have chert and limestone fragments 8 to 24 inches in diameter in the lower part of the Bt horizon."
