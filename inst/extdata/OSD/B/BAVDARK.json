  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bavdark series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from gneiss and schist. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, mountain slopes, and drainageways. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
