  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline below 40 inches.  Organic matter content in the A or Ap horizon ranges from 5 to 20 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, or their mucky analogues.  Some pedons have lenses of loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the A horizon.  The A horizon is more than 24 inches thick.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 6, or has hue of 5GY or 5G, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1.  It is stratified sandy, loamy, or clayey sediment.  Loamy textures dominate in the 10- to 40-inch control section.\nSome pedons have buried horizons of organic matter accumulation and some overlie marl formations within 6 to 20 feet of the surface."

Similar soils in closely related families are the Arapahoe, Bibb, Deloss, Ellabelle, Forescue, Hyde, Johnston, Kinston, Masontown, Pocomoke, Portsmouth, Torhunta, Toxaway, Wasda, and Wilbanks series.  Araphoe, Torhunta, and Weeksville soils are typic Humaquepts. In addition, Arapahoe is in a coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic family.  Bibb, Kinston, and Wedhadkee soils are typic Fluvaquents. In addition, Bibb is in a coarse-loamy, siliceous, acid, thermic family.  DeLoss, Hyde, Pocomoke, and Portsmouth are typic Umbraquults. Also, Deloss is in a fine-loamy, mixed, thermic family.  Ellabelle is a loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Umbric Paleaquult.  Fortescue, Johnston, Masontown, Toxaway, and Wilbanks are Cumulic Humaquepts. In addition, Forestcue is in a fine-silty, mixed, acid, thermic family. Hyde is in a fine-silty, mixed, thermic family.  Johnston is in a coarse-loamy, siliceous, acid, thermic family.  Kinston is in a fine-loamy, siliceous, acid, thermic family.  Masontown is in a coarse-loamy, siliceous, nonacid, thermic, family.  Pocomoke is in a coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic family.  Portsmouth is in a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal family.  Torhunta is in a coarse-loamy, siliceous, acid, thermic family.  Toxaway is in a fine-loamy, mixed, nonacid, mesic family.

They formed in stratified sandy, loamy, and clayey fluvial and marine sediments.  Mean annual temperature near the type location is 61 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 47 inches."

Altavista, Contoe, Dogue, and State soils are on higher, better drained parts of the landscape and have argillic horizons.  Cape Fear and Roanoke soils have clayey Bt horizons and lack cumulic epipedons.  Molena and Tarboro soils are on higher parts of the landscape and are somewhat excessively drained and sandy throughout."
