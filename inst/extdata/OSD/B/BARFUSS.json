  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 28 inches thick. The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons is 20 to 30 inches. The soil is calcareous throughout and is mildly to moderately alkaline in the A and Bt horizons and ranges to strongly alkaline in the C horizon.  The mineralogy is mixed but is strongly influenced by ashy materials.\nThe mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. The soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice and are continuously moist for 80 to 120 days following the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist. It is neutral to moderately alkaline and slightly to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is dominantly clay loam or silty clay loam, with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. This horizon contains few to common, thin to moderately thick clay films. It is moderately to strongly alkaline and moderately to strongly calcareous.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam or loam and is strongly or very strongly calcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barfuss soils occur on moderately steep to very steep slightly concave foothill slopes at elevations of 5,200 to 6,000 feet.  Slope gradients are 10 to 50 percent. They formed in dominantly medium textured materials from light colored tuff, conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone and limestone of the Salt Lake Geologic Formation. These materials contains considerable ash. The climate is moist subhumid, with warm dry summers and cold, most winter. The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
