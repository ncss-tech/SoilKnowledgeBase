They formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff over lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,829 to 2,012 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
