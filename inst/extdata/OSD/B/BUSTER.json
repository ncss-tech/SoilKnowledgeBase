  "OVERVIEW": "The Buster series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff over lacustrine deposits.  Buster soils are on fan remnants and high stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 254 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
