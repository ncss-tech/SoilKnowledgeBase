  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bevier soils typically are on long, narrow, convex ridgetops off the broader uplands and sometimes on high stream terraces.  These soils formed in a mantle of loess commonly 20 to 40 inches thick and loamy sediments and sometimes, glacial till. Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 38 inches."
