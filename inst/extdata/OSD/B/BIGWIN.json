  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees F. Depth to the contrasting substratum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Content of organic carbon ranges from .4 to 1.5 percent in the surface horizon and decreases irregularly with depth, varying between different strata. The control section is predominantly fine sandy loam but is highly stratified with thin lenses of loam, clay loam, and loamy sand.  It contains 5 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 45 percent silt, and 40 to 70 percent sand with less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent but is typically less than 5 percent. These soils typically occur in arid regions but have high water tables that fluctuate from near the surface to depths of 2 or 3 feet during most of the summer months. The A horizon has hue of 2.5 or 10YR, chroma of 2 or 3, and value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist. The A horizon ranges from pH 8.0 to pH 8.6. Typically, it has fine granular structure but it may have weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. The Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, chroma of neutral through 2, and value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  It is massive or has weakly subangular blocky structure. This horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6). A few crystals of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate occur in some strata in some pedons."

The soils formed in highly stratified recent alluvial deposits derived from a variety of rocks. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 8 inches, approximately 6 inches of which falls during the months of April through September."
