  "OVERVIEW": "The Brier series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Brier soils are on mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
