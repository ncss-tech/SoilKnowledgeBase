  "REVDATE": "03/2012",
  "STATES": "MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bridger series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash, colluvium, till or slide deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on alluvial fans, outwash fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, drainageways, moraines, hills, mountain slopes, ridges and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
