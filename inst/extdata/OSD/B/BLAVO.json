Intersecting slickensides range from few to common in the Bssg and Bsskg horizons from 7 to 29 inches, (18 to 74 cm).  A fluctuating, water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from December through May.  Redoximorphic features such as manganese nodules and oxidized iron masses with colors of 7.5YR 4/4 moist, and reduced matrix with chromas of 1 moist, occur in horizons above the duripan.  Some pedons have silt loam overwash from 6 to 20 inches, (15 to 51 cm) thick.\nThe Ap horizon dry color is 10YR 3/1 or 4/1.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1 or 3/1.

The soils are rarely to occasionally flooded for very brief to brief periods in December through March.  Water ponds frequently up to 6 inches, (15 cm) above the surface for very long duration from December through April.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from December through May.  Dams, Levees, drainage ditches, and leveling for agriculture have altered the frequency and duration of saturation, ponding and flooding."
