    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches, (51 to 102 cm).  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F, (17 to 19 degrees C).  The soil moisture control section is dry from June to October (120 to 125 days).  The particle-size control section averages 60 to 70 percent clay.  Mineralogy is smectitic.  The soil is calcareous from 15 to 34 inches, (38 to 86 cm).  Reversible surface-initiated cracks 1 to 2 inches, (2.5 to 5 cm) wide extend to a depth of 29 inches, (74 cm) from May 15 to October 15 (150 days) when the soil is not irrigated.  Intersecting slickensides range from few to common in the Bssg and Bsskg horizons from 7 to 29 inches, (18 to 74 cm).  A fluctuating, water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from December through May.  Redoximorphic features such as manganese nodules and oxidized iron masses with colors of 7.5YR 4/4 moist, and reduced matrix with chromas of 1 moist, occur in horizons above the duripan.  Some pedons have silt loam overwash from 6 to 20 inches, (15 to 51 cm) thick.\nThe Ap horizon dry color is 10YR 3/1 or 4/1.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1 or 3/1.  Clay content ranges from 60 to 70 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bssg horizon dry color is 10YR 3/1, 4/1 or 5/1.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1 or 4/1.  Clay content ranges from 65 to 70 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 0.5 to 2 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkssg dry color is 10YR 3/1, 4/1 or 5/1.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 4/1 or 4/2.  Clay content ranges from 65 to 70 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 0.5 to 1 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkg horizon dry color is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/2 or 2.5Y 4/2.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon dry color is 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 7/2, 7/3 or 8/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/2.

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; high runoff ; very slow saturated hydraulic conductivity in the Ap, Bssg and Bkssg horizons, moderately slow in the Bkg horizon and impermeable in the 2Bkgm horizon.  The soils are rarely to occasionally flooded for very brief to brief periods in December through March.  Water ponds frequently up to 6 inches, (15 cm) above the surface for very long duration from December through April.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from December through May.  Dams, Levees, drainage ditches, and leveling for agriculture have altered the frequency and duration of saturation, ponding and flooding."
