  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 40 inches and depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon content in the upper 15 inches averages approximately .9 percent.  Sand/clay ratios range from less than 1 to 2.  Cation exchanges capacity ranges from 60 to 90 milliequivalents/100 grams of clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 10 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 78 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically has granular structure but has crumb structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard and neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically clay, but ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand, with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon has oriented clay films in some part.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and has approximately 6 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Adena, Bidman, Big Horn, Campo and Natrona soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Gibbler soils have 5YR or redder hue and have a lithic contact at depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Briggsdale soils are on ridge crests and upland table land.  Slopes typically range from 0 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous material weathered from underlying soft sandstone and interbedded sedimentary shale.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 48 degrees F and the average summer temperature is 59 degrees F."
