  "OVERVIEW": "The Briggsdale series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Briggsdale soils are on ridge crests and upland table land and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 40 inches and depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon content in the upper 15 inches averages approximately .9 percent.  Sand/clay ratios range from less than 1 to 2.  Cation exchanges capacity ranges from 60 to 90 milliequivalents/100 grams of clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 10 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 78 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically has granular structure but has crumb structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard and neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically clay, but ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand, with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon has oriented clay films in some part.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and has approximately 6 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
