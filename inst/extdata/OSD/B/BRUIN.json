  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Soils in closely related families include Adler, Commerce, Convent, Marietta, Morganfield, Riedtown, Robinsonville, and Thenas series. Riedtown soils formed mainly in alluvial sediments materials derrived from loess and have aquic conditions within a depth of 24 inches. Adler soils do not have a cambic horizon and have aquic conditions within a depth of 40 inches. Convent soils also have aquic conditions and have dominant chroma of 2 within a depth of 20 inches. Commerce soils have aquic conditions and have dominant chroma of 2 within a depth of 20 inches, and have 18 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Marietta soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Morganfield and Robinsonville soils do not have a cambic horizon and do not have saturation within a depth of 40 inches for more than 30 cumulative days in normal years. Robinsonville soils also have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Thenas soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the 10 to 40 inch control section and have aquic conditions within a depth of 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bruin soils are on convex natural levee positions on the Mississippi River alluvial plain. Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in fairly recent alkaline Mississippi River silty alluvium. Most areas are protected by levees. The climate at the type location is warm and humid. The mean annual rainfall is about 52 inches, and mean annual temperature about 66 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Commerce series. The series was retypified at another site near the original type location in 2001 and was reclassified as an Oxyaquic Eutrudept.  The series was updated in 2004 to allow thin clayey overwash phases within the A horizon texture range.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon..............0 to 11 inches (A horizons)\nCambic horizon...............10 to 20 inches (Bw horizon)\nIrregular organic carbon distribution....20 to 80 inches (Ab and C horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory analyses were run on samples from the type location pedon by NSSL, Lincoln, Ne. (S96LA-107-002)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
