In addition, Bearskin soils have developed in residuum from granite and do not have a volcanic ash influence in the surface horizons; Curtis Creek soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the subsoil; and Teguro soils do not have a volcanic ash influence in the surface horizons.  Segura soils do not have a volcanic ash influence in the surface horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beden soils are on lava plains and on north-facing backslope positions of hills and buttes.  These soils formed in eolian materials derived from volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 4,100 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
