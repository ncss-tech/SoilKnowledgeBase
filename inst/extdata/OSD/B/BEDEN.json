  "OVERVIEW": "The Beden series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt.  Beden soils are on lava plains, hills, and buttes.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Elevations range from 4,100 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
