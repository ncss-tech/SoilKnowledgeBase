  "BYREV": "Rev. RJE-JAL-RJS",
  "REVDATE": "01/2012",
  "STATES": "MT,UT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Babb series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alpine till and colluvium derived from a mixture of argillite, quartzite, limestone, and calcareous shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills, moraines and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
