  "OVERVIEW": "The Beisigl series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in sandy materials weathered from soft sandstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 15 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to soft sandstone typically is 24 to 35 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Typically the soil is calcareous throughout, but in some pedons the A horizon is noncalcareous.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it is loamy fine sand but the range includes fine sandy loam and loamy sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Typically, it is loamy fine sand but the range includes fine sand and loamy sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The sandstone typically is slightly hard or hard and brittle when dry and easily crushed when moist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beisigl soils are on upland plains and side slopes of ridges, hills, buttes, and valley sides.  The slope gradient commonly is 6 to 25 percent but ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  The surface is plane or convex.  Beisigl soils formed in materials weathered from soft sandstone of Paleocene age.  The climate is cool and semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 12 to 16 inches, most of which is received in spring and early summer."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amor, Arnegard, Flasher, Grail, Lihen, Parshall, Regan, Shambo, and Vebar soils.  Amor soils occupy similar positions on nearby landscapes but have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Arnegard soils occupy nearby drainageways, are fine-loamy and very deep.  Flasher soils have a paralithic contract within a depth of 20 inches and are on crests of hills and ridges at elevations above Beisigl soils.  Grail soils are very deep, have a fine textured control section, and occupy nearby drainageways.  Lihen and Parshall soils have a mollic epipedon and are on side slopes and in drainageways downslope from Beisigl soils.  In addition, Parshall soils are coarse-loamy.  Regan soils are poorly drained and occupy side slopes and are in drainageways below Beisigl soils.  Shambo soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and are on nearby terraces and alluvial fans.  Vebar soils occupy similar positions on nearby landscapes, but have a mollic epipedon and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section."
