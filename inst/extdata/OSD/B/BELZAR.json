    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the volcanic ash and  loess layer is 7 to 14 inches.  The soil is usually moist in all horizons during part of the year but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and autumn.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 80 percent shale fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or  5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam or ashy loam and has 5 to 25 percent shale fragments, increasing in volume with increasing depth. This horizon has weak, fine, and medium granular, or weak, fine, and medium subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or loam and is channery or very channery.  Shale fragments range from 25 to 50 percent.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam and is very channery or extremely channery.  Shale fragments range from  25 to 80 percent.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belzar soils are generally on northerly aspects of glaciated mountainsides and ridgetops at elevations of 3,000 to 5,500 feet.  These soils are often adjacent to rock outcrops.  Slopes are generally complex and range from 0 to 65 percent but predominant slopes are 20 to 65 percent.  Belzar soils formed in material weathered from limestone and calcareous shale with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Although most soil areas have been glaciated, the soils contain little till.  These soils are in a continental climate having hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."

Aits and Smackout soils are more than 60 inches deep and formed in noncalcareous glacial till.  Ahren and Waits soils are over 60 inches in depth and formed in calcareous glacial till.  Huckleberry soils formed in noncalcareous shaly parent rock and are cryic.  Leadpoint soils formed in intermittently calcareous black shaly parent rock and have a mollic epipedon."

A few areas are cleared and used for dryland crops and overstory vegetation is mixed Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western larch with some western redcedar, Englemann spruce, western hemlock and western white pine.  Understory is Rocky Mountain maple, alder, creambush oceanspray, Saskatoon serviceberry, bunchberry dogwood, mallow ninebark, sitka white spirea, common snowberry, buffaloberry, thimbleberry, wild rose, Oregon-grape, and mullein. Ground vegetation is pachystima, pipsissiwa, kinnikinnick, longtube twinflower, strawberry, and pine grass."
