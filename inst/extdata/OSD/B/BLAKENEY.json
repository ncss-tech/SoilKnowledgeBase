  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the petrocalcic ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  Textures throughout are sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam or cobbly fine sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent clay. Content of coarse fragments above the petrocalcic ranges from about 0 to 25 percent.  Soil temperature ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F. Weighted average of organic carbon in the upper 16 inches ranges from 0.15 to 0.60 percent where the sand to clay ratio ranges from 4.0 to 9.0.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.\nThe A and Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6, dry or moist.\nThe Bkm horizon is usually laminar in the upper 0.5 inch to 2 inches. Plates are from 1 to 3 inches thick.  In some pedons this horizon is divided into an upper part that is laminar and strongly cemented and a lower part that is massive and weakly cemented.\nThe underlying B horizons are loamy calcareous materials that are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam and range from massive to subangular blocky to weakly cemented by calcium carbonate."

Kolar soils have soil temperatures of 59 to 63 degrees F.  Shumla soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches that occurs immediately below the petrocalcic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 180 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 2,000 to 4,600 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 18 to 25."
