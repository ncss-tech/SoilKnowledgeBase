    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 48 to greater than 80 inches (121 to greater than 201 centimeters).  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 3 to 19 inches (8 to 48 centimeters).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  This horizon ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThese soils formed in thin loess, less that 10 feet thick.  In some pedons, the loess overlies a paralithic contact of chalk and chalky shale.  Some pedons have a C horizon.  Due to excessive erosion, some pedons are calcareous to the surface."

Amos soils formed in residuum, are deep and have mixed mineralogy.  Lama soils formed in mixed alluvium, are deep and have mixed mineralogy.  Lemmon soils formed in alluvial and colluvial material, are moderately deep and have mixed mineralogy.  The Amos, Arriba, Lama, and Lemmon soils are outside the moisture and temperature range for the Balta series."

The mean annual temperature varies from 53 to 55 degrees F (12 to 14 C.), and the mean annual precipitation varies from 21 to 28 inches (533 to 711 mm).
