  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigheart series consists of shallow, well drained to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. Bigheart soils are on crests and upper side slopes of cuestas and hillslopes, in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. At the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 970 mm (38 in).",
