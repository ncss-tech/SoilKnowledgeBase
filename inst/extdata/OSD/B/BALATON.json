  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches in thickness. The clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent and the sand content ranges from 30 to 45 percent throughout. The rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 10 percent (by volume) throughout. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout. A calcic horizon occurs within 16 inches of the surface. It has 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Ap, Ak and A horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam or clay loam.\nThe ABk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6,  and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is friable or firm based on the specific geomorphic surface it occurs on."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Balaton soils are on low knolls on moraines and on rises till plains. Slopes are short and convex with gradients ranging from 1 to 6 percent. The soil is formed in calcareous, loamy glacial till of the Wisconsin Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 27 inches. The frost free days range from 120 to 170 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 850 to 1950 feet."

The well drained Barnes and Buse soils are on higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Svea soils are in concave swales and flats. The somewhat poorly drained Hamerly and Wyard soils are on lower lying areas. Wyard soils do not have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches. The very poorly drained Parnell and poorly drained Tonka soils are in depressions. The poorly drained Vallers soils are on flats and rims of depressions."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity, measured in inches per hour, is .6 to 2.0  grading to .2 to .6 on the friable till and .2 to .6 on the firm till.  Seasonal high saturation is as high as 20 inches during the months of April to June and October and November in normal years."

The firm clay loam loam till is associated with the Gary Moraine in Minnesota and possibly South Dakota.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record Number MN0819\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
