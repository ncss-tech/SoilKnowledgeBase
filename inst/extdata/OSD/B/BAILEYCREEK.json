  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of February 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Andic Haploxeralfs based on laboratory data from the UC Davis Soil Morphology Laboratory.  Field determined sodium fluoride pH along with laboratory determined 1500 kPa water/clay ratio indicates the isotic mineralogy class is appropriate.  Oxalate aluminum plus one-half oxalate extractable iron and volcanic glass content in the A and BA horizons is estimated based on laboratory data from similar soils in the survey area.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A and BA horizons).\nAndic soil properties - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A and BA horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 30 inches (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 30 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (2Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (2Bt1 horizon and part of the 2Bt2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Baileycreek sampled near the series type location has reference data by the UC Davis Soil Morphology Laboratory.  Selected data such as particle-size analysis, 1500 kPa water content, base saturation, and organic carbon content are available.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
