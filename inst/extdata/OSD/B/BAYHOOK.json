Bram soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Idahome soils have greater than 8 mmhos per cm of salinity in their Bk horizons.  Nyssaton soils have stratified lake sediments at a depth of 15 to 40 inches.  Pogal soils have more than 40 percent exchangeable sodium within a depth of 30 inches and are greater than 20 inches deep to a calcic horizon.  Portino soils have basalt at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

The remainder of this document has not been completely updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available for a pedon of the Bayhook series other than the type location by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE.  The Soil Survey Sample Number is S90ID-071-003 and the SSL pedon number is 90P1050.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
