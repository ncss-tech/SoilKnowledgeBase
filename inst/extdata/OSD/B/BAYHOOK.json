  "OVERVIEW": "The Bayhook series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in lacustrine sediments on lake terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
