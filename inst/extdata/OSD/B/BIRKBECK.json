  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Birkbeck soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slope gradients commonly are between 1 and 10 percent, but range from 0 to 18 percent. Birkbeck soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying calcareous loamy till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degree C (46 to 54 degrees F)., mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1067 mm (34 to 42 inches), frost-free period ranges from 155 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 170 to 300 m (550 to 980 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dodge, Fayette, Kendall, Miami, Reesville, Rozetta, Russell, Sabina, St. Charles, Senachwine, Sunbury, and Xenia soils. The well drained Dodge, Russell, and Senachwine soils, and the moderately well drained Miami soils are on similar nearby landscapes that have a thinner mantle of loess. The well drained Fayette and Rozetta soils generally are up slope on summits or nearer the center of interstream divides where the loess is thicker. The somewhat poorly drained Kendall and well drained St. Charles soils commonly are at lower elevations and have the lower part of their sola formed in loamy outwash. The somewhat poorly drained Reesville and Sunbury soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby. They both have gray colors higher in the sola and, in addition, Sunbury soils have a surface horizon between 18 to 25 cm (7 and 10 inches) in thickness that have moist color value of 3 or less and contain more clay in the control section. The somewhat poorly drained Sabina soils are on more nearly level parts of the landscape nearby and form a drainage sequence with Birkbeck soils. The moderately well drained Xenia soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby."

A perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) at some time between February and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material."

There is a perched water table at some time during the growing season, and soils in the same drainage sequence (Sabina) have densic horizons identified.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (A and E horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from about 9 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, 2Bt6 horizons);\nlithologic discontinuity: at a depth of 137 cm (54 inches) (contact between the Bt5 and 2Bt6 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data is available on 4 horizons of the typical pedon (pedon no. S1980IL115035).\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
