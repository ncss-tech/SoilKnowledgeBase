    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Doles, Dubois, Patricksburg, Platea, Schaffer, Wadsworth, and Weinbach series. Dubois and Shaffer soils have the base of the argillic horizon at a depth of more than 183 cm (72 inches). Doles soils do not range to extremely acid in the upper two-thirds of the control section, and are less permeable above the fragipan (See Remarks). Patricksburg soils have a paralithic contact. Platea and Wadsworth soils have rock fragments in the fragipan. Weinbach soils average more than 15 percent sand in the upper part of the control section, and contain fine mica flakes throughout."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bartle soils are on treads of stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. They formed in mixed silty alluvium and loess, with some pedons having loamy alluvium in the lower part of the series control section. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches), the mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), frost free period ranges from 160 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 122 to 183 meters (400 to 600 feet) above mean sea level."

The well drained, more permeable Elkinsville soils are on terrace treads and moderately sloping to very steep risers. The moderately well drained Pekin soils are on terrace treads and moderately sloping terrace risers. The poorly drained Peoga and Vincennes soils are on broader terrace treads."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface water runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micometers/s) above the above fragipan and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micometers/s) in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan. In undrained areas, an intermittent perched high water table is at a depth of 0.15 to 0.5 meters (0.5 to 1.5 feet) in normal years. Duration of the intermittent perched high water table is considerably less in drained phases."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The type location was changed to Scott County in 1994 to more typically represent the Bartle series. The classification of this series is being evaluated to determine if most pedons have a fragipan or fragic soil properties. An undrained phase is recognized. The Doles series is on a different landform, but the soil properties and range of characteristics are nearly the same as the Bartle series. Commonly the Bartle soils have the depth to the top of the fragipan at 76 to 102 cm (30 to 40 inches).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (Ap); 2) Argillic horizon: the zone from approximately 43 to 138 cm (17 to 55 inches) (Bt, Btg, Btx1, Btx2 horizons); 3) Fragipan: the zone from approximately 76 to 138 cm (30 to 55 inches) (Btx1, Btx2 horizons); and 4) Redoximorphic features: at 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 inches). Clay films with chroma of 2 or less are iron depleted redox features.\nRepresentative component and horizon data for the Bartle Series is in the following data mapunit: DMU ID 124476.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for this pedon, S89IN-143-011 is at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
