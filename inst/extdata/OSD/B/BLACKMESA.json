  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackmesa series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess over residuum derived from basalt . Blackmesa soils are on mesas. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
