  "OVERVIEW": "The Bloomington series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments. These soils are on lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
