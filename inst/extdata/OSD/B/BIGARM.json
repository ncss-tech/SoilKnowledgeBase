  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigarm series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, or glacial till.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, foothills, moraines, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
