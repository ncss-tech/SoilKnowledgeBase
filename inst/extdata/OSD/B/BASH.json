  "REVDATE": "02/2005",
  "STATES": "CT,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bash series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in recent alluvial deposits derived from reddish, acidic sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  They are nearly level soils on floodplains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

Gravel content ranges from 0 to 30 percent above 30 inches and from 0 to 60 percent below 30 inches. Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam through fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6 with redoximorphic features.  It is silt loam through fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  The material is massive or has weak platy structure.  It is typically silt loam through sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons have fine earth texture below 40 inches that is sand, loamy sand and loamy fine sand."
