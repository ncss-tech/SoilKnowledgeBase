  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 30 percent above 30 inches and from 0 to 60 percent below 30 inches. Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam through fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6 with redoximorphic features.  It is silt loam through fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  The material is massive or has weak platy structure.  It is typically silt loam through sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons have fine earth texture below 40 inches that is sand, loamy sand and loamy fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bash soils are nearly level soils on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils developed in alluvium derived from reddish sandstone, siltstone and shale.  The climate is humid and cool temperate with annual temperature ranging from 46 to 54 degrees F.  Annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches and the growing season ranges from about 120 to 150 days."

Very deep, somewhat excessively drained Hartford and excessively drained Penwood soils, and well to somewhat excessively drained Tunkhannock soils are on nearby terraces. Associated soils in upland till landscapes include the Cheshire, Oquaga, Lackawanna, Ludlow, Watchaug, Wellsboro, and Wethersfield series."

Pedons with sandy substrata below depths of 40 inches have moderately rapid permeability below that depth. These soils may be flooded in the spring each year."
