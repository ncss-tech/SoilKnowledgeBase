  "OVERVIEW": "The Brabas series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments with an influence of glacial till on hills and mountains.  Permeability is slow.  Brabas soils have slopes of 8 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
