  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick. Depth to dense till (densic contact) ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The sandy sediments have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and the 2B and 2BC horizons commonly contain 1 to 15 percent, by volume. Some pedons have a coarse textured layer, up to 6 inches thick, with 10 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles at the contact with the glacial till (lag line). Depth to carbonates is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. The A horizons are commonly fine sand or loamy fine sand, but includes loamy sand or sand. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have 0a or Oe horizon up to 3 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand or sand. It is strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have an EB horizon up to 10 inches thick. Redox depletions occur in this horizon within a depth of 30 inches if this horizon extends beyond 30 inches.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4. Some pedons have E' horizons with colors and textures similar to the E horizon.\nThe 2Bt1 horizon has hue of 5YR or7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. These horizons have redox depletions. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay. It is strongly acid to slightly acid. Bulk density ranges from 1.55 to 1.80 gm/cc.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and less commonly loamy sand. It is strongly acid to neutral. This horizon is somewhat restrictive to root penetration due to platy structure, which is a property of the dense till, but not as restrictive as the Cd layer. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.80 gm/cc.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with similar hue, value, chroma, and textures of the 2Bt2 horizon.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and  may have strata of loamy sand or loamy fine sand. It is moderately acid to neutral. The moist bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 2.0 gm/cc."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bemidji, Eckvoll and Huntersville series. The Bemidji, Eckvoll and Huntersville soils have hue of 10YR or yellower in the argillic horizon and underlying material. Bemidji and Eckvoll soils do not have dense till substrata or paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or convex slopes on crests or upper side slopes of glacial moraines and drumlins. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. The Bushville soils have formed in a sandy mantle of glacial outwash, eolian or lacustrine material over dense glacial till (Superior Lobe) of Late Wisconsin Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1,450 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Nokasippi, Pomroy and Watab soils, which form a drainage sequence with the Bushville soils. The very poorly drained Nokasippi soils are in swales or depressions. The poorly drained Watab soils are on low lying areas between the Bushville and Nokasippi soils. The well drained Pomroy soils are on higher lying areas. In some places the Bushville soils are associated with the well drained Flak and Milaca soils and the moderately well drained Brainerd and Mora soils, all of which do not have the sandy mantle."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Surface runoff is slow. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, moderate to very slow permeability in the loamy subsoil and very slow in the dense till. Perched saturation is as high as 1.0 feet at some time during March to June in normal years. Perching occurs as a result of the very slow saturated hydraulic conductivity in the 2BCd horizon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: About half of this soil is cleared and used for crops. Crops commonly grown are corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay. The remainder is in forest or wooded pasture. Native vegetation is primarily deciduous forest, mostly oaks, with scattered areas of coniferous forest."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 24 inches (Ap and E horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 24 to 30 inches (2Bt1 horizon); the 2Bt2 horizon does not meet the clay increase for an argillic horizon; aquic arenic subgroup - no texture finer than loamy fine sand in the upper 24 inches and redox depletions above a depth of 30 inches. The BCd horizon is considered a densic contact.\nThe structure in the BCd allows roots to penetrate to depths of 80 inches or more. This allows for greater update of water and nutrients than previously thought.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 3752 for results of laboratory data on a similar pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
