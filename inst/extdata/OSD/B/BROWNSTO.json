  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownsto series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and glacial outwash on alluvial fans, hills, hillslopes, outwash fans, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",
