  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Baboquivari soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent but are commonly 1 to 8 percent.  They formed in fan alluvium derived dominantly from granitic and gneiss materials.  Elevation ranges from 2,800 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 180 to 250 days."
