  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 38 inches thick and extends into the B2t horizon in most pedons. The combined thickness of the A1 and B2t horizons ranges from 50 to more than 66 inches. Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the upper 30 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 degrees to 46 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 67 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 50 to 85 consecutive days during the summer.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist. It ranges from silt loam to loam or cobbly loam, and is 12 to 26 inches thick. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 dry, and 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It ranges from clay to heavy silty clay loam, heavy clay loam or silty clay. Individual subhorizons range from 30 to 45 percent clay, but the weighted average of the top 20 inches of the B2t horizon is 35 to 45 percent clay. Rock fragments range structure in the B2t horizon ranges from weak to moderate, medium to coarse prismatic, or fine to coarse, angular to subangular blocky. Clay films are few to continuous, thin.  The B2t horizon ranges from medium acid to slightly acid, and from 24 to more than 47 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a C horizon at depths below 50 inches, that have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. The C horizon ranges from clay or sandy clay to silty clay loam, or loam and is gravelly or cobbly in some pedons. It is medium acid to slightly acid."

Broadhead, Cristo and Henefer soils have base saturation of less than 75 percent in the upper 30 inches. Coburg, Dixonville, Malabon and Silverton soils have mesic temperature and mixed mineralogy. Dixonville and Silverton soils also have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Donner soils have a paralithic contact with bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Hankins soils average 45 to 60 percent clay in the B2t horizon and have IIC horizons of very hard clayey sediments. Top soils have solums less than 40 inches thick."

These soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and local alluvium weathered from tuffaceous sandstone and tuffaceous limestone. The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 degrees to 44 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 57 degrees to 63 degrees F.  and the frost-free period range from 80 to 100 days."
