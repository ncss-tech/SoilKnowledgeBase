  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigcoulee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium from mixed igneous rock sources.  These soils occur on linear and concave mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
