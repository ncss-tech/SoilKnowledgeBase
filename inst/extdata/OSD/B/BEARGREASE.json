The rock fragment content by volume ranges from 10 to 55 percent in the loamy mantle and 35 to 90 percent in the underlying outwash. The total content of cobbles, stones and boulders in the outwash is greater than 15 percent.\nSome pedons have an Oa or Oe horizon up to 3 inches thick as a leaf litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 30 percent gravel, 1 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 15 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon (when present) is up to 4 inches thick. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture, rock fragment content and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have subhorizons of loam less than 8 inches thick. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 40 percent gravel, 2 to 25 percent cobbles, 0 to 20 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 35 percent cobbles, 0 to 20 percent stones, and 0 to 10 percent boulders.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beargrease soils are on convex or linear slopes of end moraines and pitted outwash plains. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. They formed in a loamy mantle and underlying sandy-skeletal glacial outwash. The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 39 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 27 to 29 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1400 to 1900 feet."
