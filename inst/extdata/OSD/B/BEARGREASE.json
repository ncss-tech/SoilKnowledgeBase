  "REVDATE": "08/2005",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beargrease series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle and underlying sandy-skeletal glacial outwash. They are on end moraines and pitted outwash plains. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The loamy mantle is 10 to 25 inches thick. Depth to free carbonates is greater than 80 inches. The rock fragment content by volume ranges from 10 to 55 percent in the loamy mantle and 35 to 90 percent in the underlying outwash. The total content of cobbles, stones and boulders in the outwash is greater than 15 percent.\nSome pedons have an Oa or Oe horizon up to 3 inches thick as a leaf litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 30 percent gravel, 1 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 15 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon (when present) is up to 4 inches thick. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture, rock fragment content and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have subhorizons of loam less than 8 inches thick. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 40 percent gravel, 2 to 25 percent cobbles, 0 to 20 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 35 percent cobbles, 0 to 20 percent stones, and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 20 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 40 percent cobbles, 0 to 35 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.
