  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bernow series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mostly sandy and loamy residuum derived from sandstone of Cretaceous age. These soils are on broad hillslopes of dissected plains.    Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
