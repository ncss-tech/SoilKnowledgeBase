  "REVDATE": "05/1999",
  "STATES": "UT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blazon series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to shale.  These soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from shale interbedded with sandstone, loamstone, and siltstone. Blazon soils are on pediments, hillslopes, plateaus and ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
