  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 24 inches thick.   Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees to 44 degrees F.  Average summer soil temperature is 45 degrees to 52 degrees F.  The hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  The A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B2t horizon has value of 5 or 4 dry, and chroma usually of 3 but ranging to 4 below the mollic epipedon.  In many pedons the A1 and B2t horizons are partially mixed by rodent burrowing.  The B2t horizon is clay loam or silty clay loam with gravel, cobble and channery fragment content ranging from 5 to 25 percent.  Its clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  The C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  Limestone cobbles, pebbles and channery fragments make up 20 to 40 percent of the volume.  In some pedons the C horizon is weakly effervescent immediately above the shattered limestone bedrock."

The Bachus, Senchert, and Vadnais soils have less then 20 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the profile. The Bavdark, Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Decross, Dehana, Dranburn, Millerlake, Pontuge, Southmount, and Thulepah soils are very deep. The Dranyon and Hagenbarth soils are deep or very deep. The Croyden soils are deep to a paralithic contact. The Squawval and Stubbs soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. The Winu soils have 2Bt horizons."

The soils formed in loamy and silty residuum weathered from hard limestone and shale of Mississippian Age.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches; mean annual temperature is 30 degrees to 42 degrees F.; frost-free period is 55 to 65 days."
