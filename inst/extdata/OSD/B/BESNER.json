  "STATES": "LA,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Besner series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are mainly on mounds and formed in alluvial sediments on Pleistocene terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F); mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).",
