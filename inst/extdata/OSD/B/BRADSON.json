  "OVERVIEW": "The Bradson series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on high stream terraces, colluvial fans, and footslopes in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from materials weathered from felsic to mafic, high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 72 inches.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the A or Ap horizons and 0 to 15 percent in the B horizon; and from 3 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments consist mostly of gravel with cobbles in some pedons.  Flakes of mica range from none to common throughout.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Where value is 3, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  In addition, eroded pedons may have an Ap horizon that has a hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Some pedons have an A2 horizon that has slightly higher value and chroma than the A1 or Ap horizon.  The A1, Ap, A2 horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  In some pedons, the BC horizon may be mottled or streaked in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  This horizon is generally coarser in texture than the Bt and commonly has a higher content of rock fragments.   It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  In some pedons, the BC horizon is underlain by a stone line or  a 2B horizon of an older land surface.\nThe C horizon, where present, has color similar to the BC horizon, or is multicolored.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Braddock and Brevard soils are on the same landscape positions as Bradson soils.  Evard and Hayesville soils are on ridges and side slopes of nearby mountains and intermountain hills."
