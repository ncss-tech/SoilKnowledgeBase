  "OVERVIEW": "The Bakscratch series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Bakscratch soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
