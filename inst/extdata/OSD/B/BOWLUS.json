  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowlus series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and basalt colluvium.  Bowlus soils are on steep to very steep side slopes and have slopes of 40 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but they are dry throughout between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to basalt is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the 2Bw horizon is 40 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches.  The textural control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 when dry.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 when moist and chroma of 2 or 3 when dry.  It is a silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 2 through 4 when moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, cobbly silty clay loam or very cobbly silty clay loam.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent cobbles.  It is moderately acid or neutral."
