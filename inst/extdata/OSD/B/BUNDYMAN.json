  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and there is no subhorizon more than 4 inches thick above 20 inches that exceeds these limits.  Weighted average gypsum content of the C horizon above a depth of 40 inches ranges from 0 to 1.5 percent (by weight).  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is typically heavy clay loam or clay but averages 35 to 50 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the major part of the control section and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral of slightly alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR; subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 14 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bundyman soils are on gently to steeply sloping upland hills and ridges.  Slopes typically range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in moderately fine to fine textured calcareous materials weathered from underlying shale bedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F and the mean summer temperature is 57 degrees F."
