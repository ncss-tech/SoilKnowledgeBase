  "OVERVIEW": "The Bedwyr series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Bedwyr soils are on hills. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

The sediment composing these rocks is Tertiary in age, tuffaceous in nature, and was deposited in a lacustrine paleoenvironment. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,710 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
