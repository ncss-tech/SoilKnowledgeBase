  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigpaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, and quartz diorite.  Bigpaw soils are on toeslopes below mountain summits.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The particle-size control sections of three pedons, including the type location, were wet sieved to determine percent of size fraction larger than very fine sand (less than 0.1mm).  The weighted averages of the three pedons ranged from 4 to 7 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
