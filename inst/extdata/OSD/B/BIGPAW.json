    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bigpaw soils are on toeslopes below domes of mountain summits.  They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from Triassic and Jurassic sandstone and siltstone, and Tertiary quartz diorite.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 48 inches  (A, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nPachic subgroup - The presence of a mollic epipedon that is greater than 16 inches thick\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 48 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity - The presence of a buried paleosol at 48 to more than 65 inches (2Btb1 and 2Btb2 horizons)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Ninth Edition, 2003.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Organic carbon values determined for one horizon from the type location by Inter-Mountain Laboratories, Inc.  The particle-size control sections of three pedons, including the type location, were wet sieved to determine percent of size fraction larger than very fine sand (less than 0.1mm).  The weighted averages of the three pedons ranged from 4 to 7 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
