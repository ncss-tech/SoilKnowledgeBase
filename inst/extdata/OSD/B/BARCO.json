The soils formed in residuum derived from acid sandstone that contains thin beds of silty and sandy shales of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 16.6 degrees C (59 to 62 degrees F). Elevation is 195 to 400 meters (640 to 1315 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 46 cm (18 to 34 inches).  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nUmbric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 inches).  (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 46 to 86 cm (18 to 34 inches).  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with sandstone is between 76 and 102 cm (30 and 40 inches).  (Cr horizons)\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone is below 102 cm (40 inches).  (R horizons)\nUdic soil moisture regime.\nThese soils are mostly in a wide belt adjacent to the Ozark border area.  The northern boundary is north of the Fort Scott escarpment.\nThese soils were formerly a part of the Bates series.  They are excluded from that series due to low base saturation.  They were originally classified as Alfisols, but lab data for the type location and from additional pedons from surrounding counties in Missouri shows that the correct classification is as an Ultisol.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S90M0-011-006.\n7/17/01 - PRF - added activity class and reformatted the RIC. Added chroma 1 to the Bt horizon.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
