The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 45 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent soft rock fragments.  The C horizon below 5 feet may have up to 60 percent soft rock fragments.  The fragments are soft weathered sandstone or siltstone. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  It is very strongly to strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  Organic matter is 4 to 8 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 3 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Clay films range from few to common and faint to distinct.  Organic matter is 2 to 4 percent.\nThe BC and C horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.

In addition Macklyn soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and Winchuck soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and have greater than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Quinliven soils have an ochric epipedon and are moderately well drained.  Vandamme soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Wadecreek soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within the lower Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bullgulch soils are on stable broad ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.   The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from arkosic sandstone and siltstone.  Elevation is 50 to 1000 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."
