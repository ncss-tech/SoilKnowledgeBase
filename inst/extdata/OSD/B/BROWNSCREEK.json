    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and the depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section contains 15 to 25 percent mica minerals in the very fine sand fraction.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from early July to early October.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about March 15 to about December 15 (270 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15.  The particle-size control section has a ratio of extractable iron oxide plus gibbsite to clay of 0.2 to 0.3.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/6, 5/4, 6/4, 10YR 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 6/2, or 4/3. Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 3/4, 10YR 3/4, 5/4, 3/6, 4/2, 3/2, or 4/4.  The A horizon is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 6/8, 5/4, 5/6, 7/6, 7/4, 6/6, 10YR 7/4, 5/3, 6/3, 5YR 4/4, 5/4, or 5/6.

It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, or extremely gravelly loam.  The Bt contains 35 to 75 percent rock fragments, and 25 to 35 percent clay.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent by sum of cations."

Walnett soils are 40 to greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have extractable iron oxide plus gibbsite to clay ratios of more than 0.4.  The Walnett series was set up broadly to establish the family in family level mapped areas. When these areas are mapped at the series level, Walnett will be split and inactivated."

Field estimates for percent clay are much higher than lab data for both measured clay and adjusted to 15 bar water content.  Field estimates are used with assumption that weathered mica fragments crushed in sample preparation influenced measured clay and 15 bar water content.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
