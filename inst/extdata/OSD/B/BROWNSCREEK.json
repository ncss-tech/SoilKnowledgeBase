  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownscreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from mica schist.  Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
