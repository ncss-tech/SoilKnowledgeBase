  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic ranges from 40 to over 60 in.  Depth to hard bedrock is over 60 in.  The particle size control section averages 20 to 50 percent clay and 10 and 35 percent sand.  Content of coarse fragments, usually chert, ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the B and C horizons.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly to slightly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have high chroma mottles in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  The Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam.  Reaction is very strongly to medium acid.  A BC horizon is in some pedons.  It is similar to the Bt horizon except it is silty clay or clay in texture.\nThe C horizon is mottled saprolite that crushes easily to sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid."

Carpenter have low shrink-swell potential in the solum and is not dominated by saprolite in the C horizon.  Renox and Washington soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in the B horizon.  Ryder soils have a solum that ranges from 20 to 40 in thick and have low shrink-swell potential."

They are sloping to steep soils on relative smooth long mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 7 to 45 percent.\nMean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 59 degrees F, and mean precipitation ranges from 37 to 45 in."

The steeper areas are in woods or pasture.  Native vegetation was mostly oak, hickory, chestnut, dogwood, maple, locust, and sassafras with some pine and cedar."

The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data from Carroll County, Virginia.  In addition, horizon nomenclature, geographically related soils and competing soils was updated with this revision.\nPrevious revision DCH-DDR 12-1980.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Chemical data for the typifying pedon is published in the Carroll County, Virginia soil survey report, issued December 1967.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
