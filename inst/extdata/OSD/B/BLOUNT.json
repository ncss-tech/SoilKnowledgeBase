  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blount soils are on wave-worked till plains, till plains, and near-shore zones (relict) of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients are commonly 1 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in silty clay loam or clay loam till. Some areas have a mantle of loess or other silty material as much as 46 cm (18 inches) thick. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1067 mm (29 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.8 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 182 days. Elevation is 183 to 457 meters (600 to 1500 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained Ashkum and Ziegenfuss soils and the very poorly drained Pewamo soils are in depressions and drainageways. The Beecher soils have a darker colored surface layer and are on similar nearby landforms. The moderately well drained Glynwood and Morley soils are nearby on slightly higher or more sloping parts of the landform."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the solum and low in the dense till. Permeability is slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the dense till."
