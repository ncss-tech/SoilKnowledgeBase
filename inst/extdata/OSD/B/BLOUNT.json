  "OVERVIEW": "The Blount series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. Blount soils formed in till and are on wave-worked till plains, till plains, and near-shore zones (relict). Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
