  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In some pedons, carbonates have been removed from the surface layer by leaching with irrigation water or addition of soil amendments. Many areas have been partially reclaimed of salinity and sodicity by farming practices such as the addition of gypsum. Significant leaching of salts has occurred. This soil has been artificially drained. All areas are protected from natural flooding by upstream reservoirs, levees and diversions of water.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -- the zone from the surface to a depth of about 14 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons). Cambic horizon -- the zone from 14 to about 25 inches (Zone of loss of carbonates  (Bt horizon))."
