  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigwall series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on terraces of mountain valley floors. Bigwall soils formed in volcanic ash overlying mixed alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
