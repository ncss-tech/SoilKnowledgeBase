    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Borealis soils are on plateaus.  These soils formed in eolian volcanic ash and in residuum derived from basalt.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,010 to 2,470 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
