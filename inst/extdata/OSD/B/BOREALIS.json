  "OVERVIEW": "The Borealis series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian volcanic ash and in residuum derived from basalt.  Borealis soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
