  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Badhap soils are on smooth to concave hills, mountains, and ridges with predominantly north aspects. They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite with a component of loess. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,075 to 3,200 meters. Climate is semiarid with cold wet winters and warm, mostly dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm that comes largely as winter snow. Additional moisture may be derived as a result of snow accumulation through drifting in the area. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
