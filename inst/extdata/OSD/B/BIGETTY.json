  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigetty series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium on the flood plain of intermittent streams.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees.",
