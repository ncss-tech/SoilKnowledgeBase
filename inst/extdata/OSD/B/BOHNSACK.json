  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches in thickness.  Depth to the calcic horizon is less than 16 inches.  Depth to the silty glaciolacustrine sediments ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the 10 to 40 inch control section typically is loam and less commonly silt loam.  It contains 2 to 10 percent by volume of rock fragments.  Typically the 10 to 40 inch control section contains less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser; however, some pedons have upper horizons with more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material.  In some pedons a thin layer of gravelly or stony material is at the contact between the C and 2C horizons.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It typically is loam, and less commonly silt loam.  In some pedons the lower part of the A horizon contains carbonate accumulations.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 30 percent and is typically loam, but silt or very fine sandy loam are in the range.  In some pedons the Bk horizon has a few fine faint redoximorphic features.\nThe 2C horizon is typically silt loam containing 70 to 80 percent silt, but silt and very fine sandy loam are in some pedons.  The lower part of the 2C horizon has few to many, faint to prominent redoximorphic features."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bohnsack soils are on level lake plains and interbeach areas.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  They formed in alluvial or glaciofluvial sediments over glaciolacustrine deposits.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  Most of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer."

The Emrick and Lankin soils are better drained and do not have calcic horizons within a depth of 16 inches.  Gilby soils are more poorly drained and fine-loamy.  The Tiffany soils do not have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches and are coarse-loamy."
