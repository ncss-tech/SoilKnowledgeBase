  "OVERVIEW": "The Breeton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and hills.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
