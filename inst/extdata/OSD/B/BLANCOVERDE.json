  "OVERVIEW": "The Blancoverde series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from lacustrine sediments.  Blancoverde soils are on hills and mesas and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
