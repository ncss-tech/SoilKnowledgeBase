  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  The particle-size control section averages from 18 to 27 percent clay and from 45 to 65 percent total sand.  The series control section averages from 15 to 30 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand.  The lower part of the series control section has 13 to 17 percent clay.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology but some are limestone and some are shale.  Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 15 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to slightly alkaline in the upper horizons, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the solum and is slightly or moderately alkaline in the in the substratum.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 10 percent.  Redox accumulations are within a depth of 40 inches.  Redox depletions are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon in some pedons.  Saturation occurs at 30 to 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A or Ap is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is commonly fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  Bw horizons with spodic color have pH greater than 5.9 or have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.  The Bw horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons with an E horizon and a Bw horizon, have an E' horizon below the Bw horizon.  It has color and texture like the E horizon described above.\nBranstad soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 6.  It is mostly sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or loam but some pedons have subhorizons of sandy loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe Btk horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Typically it is fine sandy loam or loam."
