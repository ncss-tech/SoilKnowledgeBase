  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackash series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in tephra derived from volcanic rock. Blackash soils are on cinder cones and lava fields. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. (6.7 degrees Celsius)",
