  "OVERVIEW": "The Billycanyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on ridges. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.0 degree C.",
