  "REVDATE": "11/2016",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Betra series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mainly granitic rocks and quartzite with a component of loess.  The Betra soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
