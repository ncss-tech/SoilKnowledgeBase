These soils formed in alluvium derived from mainly granitic rocks and quartzite and in some areas alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
