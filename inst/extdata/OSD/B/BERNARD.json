  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bernard series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation.  These soils are on flats on flat coastal plains.    Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
