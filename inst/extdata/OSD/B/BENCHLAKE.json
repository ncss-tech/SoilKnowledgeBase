Slopes are 10 to 70 percent. Elevations are 2700 to 3880 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 685 to 1505 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 0 to 6 degrees C. The frost free period is 40 to 110 days."
