  "OVERVIEW": "The Borea series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on till plains.  These soils formed in clayey glacial till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits underlain by loamy and/or sandy stratified lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on till plains and/or lake plains.  Permeability is extremely slow or very slow in the clayey till and moderate to rapid in the stratified lacustrine deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 85 percent.  These soils have linear extensibility of 6 cm or more in the upper 40 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout.  Redox features occur in all layers between either the lower boundary of an Ap horizon or a depth of 10 inches below the mineral soil surface (whichever is deeper) and a depth of 16 inches.  Aquic conditions occur within 20 inches for some time in most years.  These soils react positively to alpha, alpha-dipyridyl at some time during saturation.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nBorea soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically clay but in some pedons, it is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically clay but some pedons have subhorizons of silty clay. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically clay but some pedons have subhorizons of silty clay or thin strata of silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is stratified.  Individual strata are mostly silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sand, or fine sand but a few thin strata of finer texture are in many pedons.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has color and texture like the 2Bk horizon described above.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons have a 2Ck horizon with colors and textures similar to those of the 2Bk horizon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland.  Oats, timothy, bromegrass, reed canary grass, alfalfa, and trefoil are the principal crops.  Many areas which were formerly cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, balsam poplar, quaking aspen, paper birch bur oak, and willow.  Common understory species are speckled alder, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  An Aeric Vertic subgroup should be proposed to recognize the vertic property.  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: ochric epipedon - 0 to 2 inches (A horizon); glossic horizon - 2 to 13 inches (E/B horizon); argillic horizon - 13 to 57 inches (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons); vertic feature - linear extensibility of 6 cm or more in the upper 40 inches;  aquic feature - redox features in all layers between the a depth of 10 inches below the mineral soil surface and a depth of 16 inches and aquic conditions  within 20 inches for some time in most years; particle size control section 13 to 33 inches.\nThe intense reddish colors inherent in the parent material often mask the redoxomorphic features (color - chroma) and make taxonomic classification difficult.  Water table studies in this soil (and it's associated soils) were used to classify this series.\nOnly series status, responsibility, and scriveners errors changed - 3/09."
