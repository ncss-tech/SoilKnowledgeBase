Some pedons contain a few siliceous pebbles throughout. The mollic epipedon is more than 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 5, chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam with a clay content ranging from 35 to about 50 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline in the upper part and from slightly acid through moderately alkaline and calcareous in the lower part.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have colors in shades of gray, brown, or yellow.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Some pedons contain strata of loam on sandy clay loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline and calcareous.  The BCk horizon contains more than 20 percent visible films, threads, soft masses, or concretions of calcium carbonate."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include Abilene, Brewer, Dodson, McLain, Mingo, and Wolco series in the same family and the similar Luckenbach and Thurber series.  Abilene and Luckenbach soils have secondary carbonates within 28 inches of the soil surface.  In addition, Luckenbach soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Brewer, Dodson, and McLain soils have less than 20 percent calcium carbonate in the C horizon.  Mingo soils have a lithic contact of limestone within 22 to 40 inches of the soil surface.  Wolco soils have a lithic contact of limestone  within 40 to 60 inches of the soil surface.  Thurber soils have an epipedon that is both massive and hard when dry and montmorillonitic mineralogy."

The soil is formed in ancient stream alluvium.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 36 to 54.  The mean annual temperature is 58 to 70 degrees F."

Bosque, Frio, and Santo soils are   below on flood plains and these soils lack argillic horizons.  May, Thurber, and Velow soils are on positions similar to Blanket soils.  May and Velow soils have fine-loamy control sections.\nPedernales and Windthorst soils are above Blanket soils on low ridges or slopes along drainageways.  Pedernales and Windthorst soils lack mollic epipedons."
