  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. RB-DES-RJS",
  "REVDATE": "03/2012",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Branham series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from granite and granitic gneiss.  These soils are on hills, ridges and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
