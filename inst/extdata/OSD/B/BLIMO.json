  "OVERVIEW": "The Blimo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Blimo soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, beach plains, barrier beaches, and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
