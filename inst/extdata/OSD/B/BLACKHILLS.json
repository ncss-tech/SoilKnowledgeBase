    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blackhills soils are on hills. They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from basaltic tuff-breccia and tuff. Slopes are 15 to 55 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,590 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, with an annual snowfall of about 500 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C. The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Anawalt soils are clayey, shallow to lithic contacts, and have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons. Coztur soils are loamy, shallow to lithic contacts, and have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons. Erakatak soils are clayey-skeletal, moderately deep to bedrock, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons. Fort Rock soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are very deep. Freznik soils are fine, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons. Suckerflat soils are ashy and shallow to lithic contacts."
