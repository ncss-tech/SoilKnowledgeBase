    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness to caliche commonly is\n20 to 30 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Calcium\ncarbonate equivalent ranges from about 5 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, dark grayish brown, or dark brown in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or\n3.  Moist values are less than 3.5.  It is fine sandy loam or\nloam.\nThe B horizon is grayish brown to brown or dark brown in hue of\n7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Clay content in the B and Bk horizons is\n20 to 32 percent.\nThe Bk horizon is brown to pale brown, light yellowish brown, or yellowish brown in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and\nchroma of 3 and 4.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Ck horizon is laminar and indurated in the upper part in some pedons."

Cho soils have soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F., have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate\nequivalent, and have sola less than 20 inches thick.  Hidalgo and Pettus soils lack petrocalcic horizons.  Jimenez and Olmos soils\nhave more than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments and have\nsola less than 20 inches thick.  Valco soils have sola less than\n20 inches thick."

Olmos soils occur in slightly higher positions in the landscape and have common fragments of caliche scattered on their surfaces.  Valco soils occur in positions very similar to\nBatesville soils.  Caid and Uvalde soils occur in similar or\nslightly lower positions, lack the strongly cemented caliche\nlayers, and have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Randado soils are\nmore red in color, contain Bt horizons, and have sola less than 20 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as rangeland.  The original plant\ncommunity was an open grassland, dominated by mid grasses, with an occasional mesquite tree or woody shrub.  Bushsunflower, bundleflower, and orange zexmania are important forbs.  With retrogression, woody plants such as guayacan, guajillo, hackberry, lotebush, wolfberry, mesquite, and whitebrush increase or invade.  Herbaceous plants which increase or invade are curlymesquite, threeawn, Hall's panicum, fall witchgrass, western ragweed, and annual weeds and grasses."
