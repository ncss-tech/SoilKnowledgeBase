  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to hard bedrock is more than 6 feet. Secondary CaC03 concretions range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the soil and tend to increase with depth. Rock fragments, of shale, chert, quartzite, greenstone or sandstone range from 0 to 2 percent in the upper 40 inches and from 0 to 25 percent in lower horizons. Many pedons contain relic snail shells particularly in the lowermost horizons. The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout. Surface horizons commonly are neutral. Buried A horizons are evident in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or lOYR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Surface layers having value of less than 3.5 are thin, typically less than 6 inches. The A horizon is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through lOYR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is dominantly silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have a thin C horizon of loam, silty clay, or clay loam. The C horizon commonly shows evidence of stratification.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or lOYR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. High chroma mottles are present in some pedons. Texture is variable and includes fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sand, loam, and thin layers of silt loam or clay loam. In some pedons, there are gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The only other known series in the same family is the Dorchester series. Dorchester soils occur in mid-continent and have a significantly different effective climate. Also, they are more highly stratified than Buckton soils. The Genesee, Gessie, Varro, and Weaver soils are in closely related fine-loamy families. In addition, Genesee soils do not have free carbonates between a depth of 10 to 20 inches and Varro soils have a thermic temperature regime. Weaver soils have 2 chroma mottles within a depth of 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buckton soils are on level to gently sloping flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in sediments that were washed from uplands underlain by limestone, calcareous shale and sandstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 51 degrees to 56 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 44 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Chagrin, Lobdell, Millrock, and the competing Weaver soils on flood plains. Berks, Frederick, Lodi, and Poplimento soils are on adjacent uplands. Chagrin, Lobdell, and Millrock soils do not have carbonates between a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Berks soils are loamy-skeletal, and Frederick, Lodi, and Poplimento soils have a strongly expressed argillic horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS: Particle size data from the type location and from Shenandoah County indicate a fine-silty family.\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data from Warren County, Virginia. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 2/97--JHW-DDR\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
