  "OVERVIEW": "The Biji series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  The Biji soils are on dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
