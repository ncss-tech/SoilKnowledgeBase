  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches.  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  Dry soil cracks 0.25 to 0.5 inch wide at the surface but is less than 0.4 inch wide at a depth of 20 inches.  COLE ranges from 0.04 to 0.07 in the near surface horizons and decreases with depth.  COLE does not equal or exceed 0.07 in any layer with a thickness of 20 inches or more.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 40 to about 65 percent.  Total clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 40 to 55 percent and silicate clay ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  The silicate clay fraction is assumed to be dominantly montmorillonite.  Sand content is less than 5 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges 35 to 60 percent.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Films and threads of carbonate range from none to common on the surfaces of peds in the upper 40 inches.  Soft powdery forms of carbonate occur in some pedons below 40 inches. Secondary carbonates make up less than 5 percent of any horizon."
