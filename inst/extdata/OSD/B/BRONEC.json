  "OVERVIEW": "The Bronec series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, slide deposits and tertiary fill material. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills, mountain slopes, escarpments, landslides and debris flows. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
