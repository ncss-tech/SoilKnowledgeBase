  "OVERVIEW": "The Beckham series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum from marble. These soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.",
