  "OVERVIEW": "The Berks series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone on rounded and dissected uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid. Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches. Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the top of the cambic horizon range from 3 to 12 inches. Rock fragments range from 10 to 50 percent in the Ap and A horizons, from 15 to 75 percent in individual horizons of the B, and from 35 to 90 percent in the C horizon. The average volume of rock fragments in the particle-size control section is more than 35 percent. In unlimed soils reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid throughout.  The dominant clay minerals are illite, vermiculite and interstratified vermiculite chlorite.  Small amounts of kaolinite are present.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Hue of 5YR is restricted to the lower part of the soil. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It contains 5 to 32 percent clay and 40 to 60 percent silt. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure in the Bw horizon and is usually obscured by the rock fragments in the CB horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture in the fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam."

Brownsville, Greenlee, Handshoe and Northcove soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Calvin soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the B horizon. Cardiff, Highsplint, Parker, Sylco, and Wyoming soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Centralpark (T) soils have rock fragments of concrete and asphalt. Chamate and Remote soils are formed in a more moist climate. Konnarock soils have ryhythmite and tillite rock fragments.  Lippitt soils have till over Gneiss, schist or gravel.  Watt soils have colors with chroma of 3 or less in the B horizon."

Blairton and Comly soils are moderately well drained. Brinkerton soils are poorly drained. Gilpin soils have fewer rock fragments and are on similar landscapes.
