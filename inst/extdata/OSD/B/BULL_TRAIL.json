    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 56 to 58 degrees F. and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F. after about the 10th of February.  Soil between the depths of about 6 and 18 inches usually is moist in some or all parts from about December 1 until late May and usually is dry all the rest of the year.  The A and B horizons have up to 15 percent rock fragments, mostly 2 mm to 3/4 inch in diameter.  Some pedons have stones and cobblestones on the surface.  The C horizon has up to 35 percent rock fragments but most pedons have less than 15 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon is grayish brown or brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It has 1.5 to 3 percent organic matter in the upper part that decreases regularly to less than 1 percent 5 to 9 inches below the surface.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, light brown, light yellowish brown or yellowish brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and is heavy sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline and the base saturation is more than 75 percent.\nThe C horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown, yellowish brown or light brownish gray.  It is dominantly sandy loam, but is somewhat stratified and texture ranges from loamy sand to loam.  In some pedons there are some lenses weakly cemented by silica or lime or both."

Bancas, Dozel, and Hilt soils have a paralithic contact 20 to 40 inches below the surface.  Blakeport and Morical soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface and are dry for 60 to 80 days.  Chauler and Kitchen Creek soils have a mollic epipedon.  Also, Chualar soils have a 59 to 63 degree F. mean annual soil temperature and Kitchen Creek soils have less than 18 percent clay.  Mary soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
