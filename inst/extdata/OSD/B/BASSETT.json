  "REVDATE": "08/2013",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bassett series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 885 millimeters.",

In these cases, the plow layer (Ap horizon) extends to the argillic horizon without transitional layers.\nSome pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.\nMollic subgroup based on colors and thickness of the ochric epipedon.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nOfficial Series Description Type Location moved (08/2013) due to previous site (site id-1965IA089001) classifying as Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, eleventh edition, 2010.\nThe MLRA 104 Steering Committee approved property edits to this series in February 2004."
