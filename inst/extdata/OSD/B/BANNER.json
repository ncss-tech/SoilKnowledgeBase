  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to 19 inches (Ap1, Ap2, and Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 7 to 32 inches (Bt and Btk horizons).\nSecondary carbonate accumulation - The zone from 19 to 54 inches (Btk and Bk horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 7 to 27 inches (Bt and part of the Btk horizon).\nThis pedon was not placed in the Vertic subgroup because no slickensides were described.  The morphology of this pedon appears to be influenced somewhat by sodium; SAR may be higher than estimated.  11/76 OSD gave soil depth as 40 to 60 or more inches; the only Banner SIR has depth of greater than 60 inches, so series was revised to include only very deep soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
