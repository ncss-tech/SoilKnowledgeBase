  "OVERVIEW": "The Big Iron Series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate and moderately slow in the upper part and very slow in the lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
