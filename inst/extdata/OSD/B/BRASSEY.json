Apmat soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Durst, Fraval, Mulshoe and Sapkin soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Fergie soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and are dry 90 to 120 days. Henhoit soils are deeper than 50 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR. Little Wood soils do not have an O horizon, are dry for more than 75 consecutive days (12 to 18 inches annual precipitation) and are 21 to 34 inches deep to the sandy-skeletal substratum and base of argillic horizon. Morningstar have 25 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon and do not have sandy-skeletal substratum. Sattley soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and are dry about 105 consecutive days during summer and fall."
