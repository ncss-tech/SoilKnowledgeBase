  "OVERVIEW": "The Brassey series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in volcaniclastic sediments and alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent in intermontane basins. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Little Wood soils do not have an O horizon, are dry for more than 75 consecutive days (12 to 18 inches annual precipitation) and are 21 to 34 inches deep to the sandy-skeletal substratum and base of argillic horizon. Morningstar have 25 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon and do not have sandy-skeletal substratum. Sattley soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and are dry about 105 consecutive days during summer and fall."
