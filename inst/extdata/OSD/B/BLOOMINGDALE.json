  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 14 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments, mostly rounded pebbles, range from 0 to 5 percent in the upper 40 inches and up to 20 percent below 40 inches. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Mottles and redoximorphic features are in shades of gray or brown. Texture is commonly silty clay loam but ranges to include loam and silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Mottles and redoximorphic features are in shades of gray ,brown, or red and range from few to many. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Mottles and redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, brown and red and range from few to many. Texture is commonly silty clay but ranges to include silty clay loam or clay. Below 40 inches texture may include their gravelly analogues."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils in other families include the Lee, Melvin, and Newark series. Lee soils are strongly acid, have siliceous mineralogy, and are in a fine-loamy family. Melvin and Newark soils are in a fine-silty family and have soil temperatures less than 59 degrees F. In addition, Newark soils are somewhat poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bloomingdale soils are on nearly level flood plains, and in depressions. They also occur occasionally in small upland depressions. Many areas are subject to ponding. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from shales and limestone. The mean annual air temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bays, Bellamy, Steadman and Pettyjon soils. Bays soils, on adjacent uplands, are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock. Bellamy soils, on adjacent terraces, are moderately well drained and have a brittle layer in the subsoil. Steadman soils, on slightly higher elevations, are moderately well drained. Pettyjon soils, on flood plains, are well drained."

    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Melvin, Guthrie, Prader, and Purdy series. The classification was changed from fine-silty to fine based on lab data.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon),\nCambic horizon - 5 to 17 inches (Bg horizon),\nRedoximorphic features: iron depletions and accumulations in each horizon, created by oxidation and/or reduction of iron during saturation of the soil with water.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data - Characterization of the type location by the National Soil Survey Laboratory. Pedon No. 87P0144\nSIR NUMBER: TN0176\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
