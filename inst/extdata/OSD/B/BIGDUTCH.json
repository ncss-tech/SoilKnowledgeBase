  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigdutch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Bigdutch soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
