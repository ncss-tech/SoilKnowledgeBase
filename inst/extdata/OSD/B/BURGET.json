(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on August 29, 1992, the soil was dry throughout.   All textures are apparent field textures.)\nA--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stony ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine irregular pore; 10 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F.  The average summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The upper 7 to 11 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.50 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 3 to 8 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent coarse fragments.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 11 inches thick.  Base saturation (by sum) is estimated to be 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 1 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is 10 to 20 percent pebbles and 10 to 25 percent cobbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burget soils are on shoulders, ridges, and backslopes of mountains. These soils are mainly on southerly aspects at elevations from 5,200 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F, average July temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."

Crocamp soils are on southerly aspects of mountain backslopes and are deep and loamy-skeletal.  Devore soils are on mountain backslopes, are moderately deep to a lithic contact and have an ochric epipedon that is andic.  Myerscreek soils are deep soils on mountain backslopes, have a dense loamy-skeletal glacial till substratum and have an ochric epipedon that is andic.  Treebutte soils are on ridges and shoulder slopes of mountains, are shallow to a lithic contact and have an ochric epipedon."
