  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Burget series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rock, with a component of volcanic ash.  These soils are on shoulders, ridges, and backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F.  The average summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The upper 7 to 11 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.50 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 3 to 8 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent coarse fragments.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 11 inches thick.  Base saturation (by sum) is estimated to be 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 1 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is 10 to 20 percent pebbles and 10 to 25 percent cobbles."

The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F, average July temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F.
