The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 30 inches depending on the land leveling. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages from 27 to 35 percent clay but individual layers have clay content of 18 to 35 percent. Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent in the upper 24 to 30 inches and decreases regularly. Organic matter content is less than 0.5 percent at a depth of 50 inches. Some pedons are noneffervescent below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 3/2 or 5/2. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2 or N 2/0.

The water table is now 3 to 5 feet December through March. They are now artifically drained or have had their water source intercepted. They are protected from major flooding by large flood control levees and reservoirs. Where not protected, flooding is common January through March."
