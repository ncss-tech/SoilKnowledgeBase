    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are saturated with stagnant water for at least a few days. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 30 inches depending on the land leveling. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages from 27 to 35 percent clay but individual layers have clay content of 18 to 35 percent. Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent in the upper 24 to 30 inches and decreases regularly. Organic matter content is less than 0.5 percent at a depth of 50 inches. Some pedons are noneffervescent below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 3/2 or 5/2. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2 or N 2/0. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has color of 10YR 6/1; 7.5YR 5/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2; 5Y 5/4, 6/1 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/4, 5/3; 5Y 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/5; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2. Redoximorphic features are distinct or prominent. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Typically, the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 2.0 decisiemens per meter and the sodium adsorption ratio is less than 6.\nThe C horizon has color of 5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 6/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 6/2 or 10YR 6/3.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bolfar soils are in valley basins and on flood plains. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from granitic rocks. Much of this soil has been land leveled, but was hummocky in its natural landscape. Elevation is 35 to 110 feet. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F. The frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

Elnido soils, on channels, flood plains, basin floors and valley basins, have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Escano soils, on valley basins, have a calcic horizon at a depth of 25 to 39 inches. Kesterson soils, on valley basins, have a natric horizon. Palazzo soils, on flood plains and basin floors, have organic matter that decreases irregularly with depth, have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick, and are not calcareous at depths of 10 to 20 inches."

These soils were previously very poorly drained and ponded with stagnant water for extended periods during winter and spring months and are now ponded for periods of 2 to 7 days from December to February. The water table is now 3 to 5 feet December through March. They are now artifically drained or have had their water source intercepted. They are protected from major flooding by large flood control levees and reservoirs. Where not protected, flooding is common January through March."

These soils are being differentiated by having a thick mollic epipedon which is not characteristic of the Temple series. pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators. Texture determined by Bouyoucos method. SAR determined by versinate method.\nRunoff terminology adjusted 4/96 to adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93\nCEC/Clay ratio estimated from similar soils with laboratory data in the W. Stanislaus Soil Survey Area.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedon S87CA-019-016 (taxadjunct-not calcareous) and S91CA-099-001 (partial pedon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
