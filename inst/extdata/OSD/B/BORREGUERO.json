Amador soils (MLRA 18) are on hills, formed from rhyolitic tuffaceous sediments, are influenced by ash, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 64 to 67 degrees F. Osito soils (MLRA 20) are on uplands, weathered from interbedded andstone and shale, have silt loam textures and have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 70 degrees F. Wolfey soils (MLRA 5) are on hills and mountains with mean annual precipitation of 45 to 60 inches and have reaction of moderately acid or slightly acid in the Bw horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as Rough Broken Land in the unpublished report, Soil Survey of Western Fresno, 1967. They are being differentiated by being classified and mapped. The pH is determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method. In 1997 the classification of the tentative soil series was changed from loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic, shallow Typic Xerorthents to the current classification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
