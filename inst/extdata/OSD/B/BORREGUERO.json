  "OVERVIEW": "The Borreguero series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountain slopes and escarpments on mountains. These soils formed in material weathered from marine sandstone. Slope is 30 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as Rough Broken Land in the unpublished report, Soil Survey of Western Fresno, 1967. They are being differentiated by being classified and mapped. The pH is determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method. In 1997 the classification of the tentative soil series was changed from loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic, shallow Typic Xerorthents to the current classification."
