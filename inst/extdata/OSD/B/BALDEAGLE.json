  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Baldeagle series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in material weathered from granite and gneiss bedrock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid to rapid below.  Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",
