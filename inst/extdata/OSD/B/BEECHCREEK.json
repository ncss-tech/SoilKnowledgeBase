  "OVERVIEW": "The Beechcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash influenced colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolite.  These soils occur on hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
