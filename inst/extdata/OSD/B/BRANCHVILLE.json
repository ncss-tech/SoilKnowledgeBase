  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cardinal, Celina, Eudy, Hartville, Jerktail, Licking, Loudon, Tarlton and Whippany. Cardinal soils are less than 203 cm (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in glaciolacustrine sediments. Celina soils are moderately deep to dense till and formed in thin loess and the underlying loamy till of high-lime content. Eudy soils formed in loess and the underlying clayey residuum from cherty dolostone and are moderately deep to dolostone bedrock. Hartville soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section and formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone and shale. Jerktail soils have bedrock at depths of less than 203 cm (80 inches) and formed in colluvium and residuum from dolostone. Licking soils are less than 203 cm (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in lacustrine sediments. Loudon soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 inches) and formed in thin loess, till and residuum from shale and limestone. Tarlton soils are less than 106 cm (42 inches) to bedrock and formed in till and residuum.  Whippany soils are less than 203 cm (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in sediments derived from shale, basalt and granite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Branchville soils are on benches below sandstone and siltstone bedrock outcrops. Slopes typically are from 20 to 25 percent and range to 30 percent. They formed in 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of colluvium from sandstone and siltstone, and the underlying residuum from shale bedrock (Mississippian age). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat excessively drained, moderately deep Adyeville and Tipsaw soils are the upper part of backslopes. The very deep, moderately well drained Deuchars soils, the deep or very deep, moderately well drained Ebal soils and the moderately well drained, moderately deep Kitterman soils are either on higher lying shoulder and backslopes, or on lower lying footslopes. The well drained, very deep Jubin soils formed in more than 80 inches of colluvium and typically are on more sloping areas in a complex with the Branchville soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour) in the upper part of the solum and slow (0.06 to 0.2 inches per hour) in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is high. Depth to an intermittent, perched high water table is at 61 to 91 cm (2.0 to 3.0 feet) from December through April in most years."
