  "OVERVIEW": "The Bolent series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  They formed in recent sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters (20 inches) at the type location.",
