  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluegulch series consists of well drained, deep soils that formed in colluvium from welded tuff. They are on dipslopes and ridgetops. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
