  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigsag series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on flood plains or lake plains, typically adjacent to shallow, saline lakes.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
