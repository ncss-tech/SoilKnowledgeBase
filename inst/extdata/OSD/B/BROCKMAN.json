  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the 4-month period following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 56 degrees F. The thickness of the solum above the nonconforming IIC horizon is 15 to 24 inches. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Rock fragments are serpentinite and range from 15 to 35 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It is clay or clay loam and averages 35 to 45 percent clay. Cobbles range from 10 to 20 percent and pebbles from 5 to 10 percent. The IIC horizon is 50 to 65 percent clay, 10 to 15 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent pebbles. It is massive when moist and has a medium to coarse prismatic structure when dry.\nThe IIIC2 horizon has 15 to 35 percent partially weathered cobbles and 10 to 25 percent partially weathered pebbles and averages 50 to 65 percent clay."

Cornutt soils have an argillic horizon and mixed mineralogy. Dubakella, Eightlar, and Pearsoll soils are skeletal.  Also Dubakella soils are moderately deep and Pearsoll soils are shallow."
