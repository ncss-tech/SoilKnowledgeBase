  "OVERVIEW": "The Baytown series consists of well drained soils that formed in a moderately thick mantle of loess and in the underlying residuum weathered from sandstone bedrock on dissected uplands.  These soils have moderate permeability in the solum and rapid permeability in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.  The thickness of solum and depth to the IICr horizon range from 20 to 40 inches.  The loess mantle is 14 to 34 inches thick. Coarse fragments typically are lacking in the loess mantle and comprise as much as l0 percent of the volume of the lower part of the solum and upper IIC horizon.  They are mostly sandstone.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam but very fine sandy loam and loam high in content of silt or very fine sand is in the range.  It is very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam high in content of very fine sand or silt.  It has mottles in the lower part in some pedons.  It is very strongly through slightly acid.\nThe IIB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR with value and chroma of 4 through 6.  It has mottles in some pedons.  It formed in a mixture of loess and residuum or in residuum and is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons have a IIC horizon. It is strongly through slightly acid.\nThe IICr horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 and chroma of 1 through 6. It is typically weakly cemented sandstone that crushes to sand or fine sand.  In some pedons it has strongly indurated layers."

They formed in a loess mantle that is 14 to 34 inches thick and in residuum weathered from sandstone bedrock.  The climate is humid continental with mean annual temperature ranging from 42 to 47 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranging from 28 to 33 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Baytown soils are commonly associated with the Boone, Copaston, Gale, and Ostrander soils on nearby landscapes.  Boone soils are on convex ridgetops and formed entirely in residuum weathered from sandstone bedrock.  Copaston soils are on higher lying ridgetops and steep side slopes where limestone bedrock caps the underlying sandstone.  Gale soils are on similiar but generally north facing landscape positions, lack mollic epipedons, and contain argillic horizons. Ostrander soils are on similiar landscape positions but formed in a silty mantle and underlying glacial till."
