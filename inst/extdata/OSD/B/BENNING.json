These soils formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence. The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches, the average annual air temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F and the frost free season is 70 to 90 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arbone, Bezzant, Hondoho, Iphil (T), Rexburg and Watkins Ridge soils. Arbone soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Arbone, Hondoho and Rexburg soils lack lime in the surface layer. Bezzant and Hondoho soils have a loamy-skeletal control section. Iphil and Rexburg soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section. Watkins Ridge soils are not pachic. Rexburg and Iphil soils are on loess covered fan remnants above Benning soils. Arbone and Watkins Ridge soils are on smooth to slightly concave slopes near the middle of fan remnants. Bezzant and Hondoho soils occur on terrace breaks and in and near old stream channels."
