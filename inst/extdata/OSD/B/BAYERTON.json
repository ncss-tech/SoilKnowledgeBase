  "OVERVIEW": "The Bayerton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone. Bayerton soils are on ridge crest and mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
