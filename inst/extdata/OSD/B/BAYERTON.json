  "OVERVIEW": "The Bayerton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone. Bayerton soils are on ridge crest and mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 15 to 36 inches. Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon ranges from .8 to 2 percent in the surface horizons and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 64 degrees F.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has platy structure but has granular structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard, and neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is typically sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 45 to 70 percent, with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline. The B3ca horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It has 4 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Allens Park soils are noncalcareous throughout and contain a large amount of medium and coarse angular granitic sand. Fairport soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the B2t horizon. Gateson soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches, are noncalcareous, and have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Haugan, Nebish, and Plome lack a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.
