The content of weathered rock fragments or pebbles, 2 to 76 mm in size, range from 5 to 25 percent, by volume, in the A, E, and Btg horizons.  Below these horizons, the content of rock fragments or pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 or 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe lower part of the Btg horizon has the same range of colors as the upper part.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, white, or brown range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or gray range from few to many.

All of these but the Wacahoota soils have less than 5 percent, by volume, rock fragments 2 mm to 76 mm in size in the soil.  Blichton and Wacahoota soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  In addition, Blichton soils are very poorly drained and have more than 5 percent plinthite in the lower argillic horizon and low base status.  The very poorly drained and poorly drained Fellowship soils are on similar to lower positions have umbric epipedons and have clayey control sections.  Flemington soils are on similar positions and have more clay in the control section.  Kanapaha soils are on similar to lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  The somewhat poorly drained Lochloosa and Micanopy soils are on higher positions.  In addition, Lochloosa soils have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches in thickness and Micanopy soils have more clay in the control section."
