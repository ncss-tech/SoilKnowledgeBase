  "OVERVIEW": "The Belen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium of old oxbow lakes that are underlain by loamy alluvium several feet thick.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",

The soils formed in clayey alluvium of old oxbow lakes that are underlain by loamy alluvium several feet thick.  The climate is semiarid to arid continental.  At the type location average annual temperature is 58 to 67 degrees F. and annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  Much of the precipitation falls during the summer in heavy thunderstorms of short duration.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is about 14.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."
