  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and thickness of the solum range from 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle size control section averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches is 60 to 62 degrees F.  These soils are moist in some parts above bedrock more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but are continually dry for 60 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 7 out of 10 years. The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is gravelly sandy clay loam or sandy clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bearskin soils are on gently sloping to very steep mountainsides, ridges, and hillsides at elevations of 6,200 to 7,800 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in residual soil material 10 to 20 inches thick over thick beds of granite.  Mean annual air temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is about 61 degrees to 62 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 to 20 inches.  The freeze free period is 60 to 85 days."

Hades soils are deep and very deep and are on hillsides.  Mud Springs soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over granite bedrock."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Brunizems.  Diagnositic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon -the zone from the surface of the soil to 10 inches (A, Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon -the zone from 5 to 10 inches (Bt horizon).\nParticle size control section -the zone from the surface of the soil to 10 inches (A, Bt horizons).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
