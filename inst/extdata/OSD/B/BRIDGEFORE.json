  "OVERVIEW": "The Bridgefore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
