  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownstone series consists of excessively drained soils which are moderately deep to a lithic contact with sandstone.  They formed in sandy-skeletal beach deposits or residuum from sandstone, or both, on sandstone bedrock controlled glaciated uplands.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy skeletal deposits and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, depth and thickness are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the solum and depth to hard sandstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are predominantly sandstone with some igneous and metamorphic.  Volume of rock fragments averages 35 percent or more in the particle-size control section, but is less than 35 percent in individual subhorizons in some pedons.  Volume of gravel or channers ranges from 5 to 40 percent throughout.  Volume of cobbles or flagstones ranges from 10 to 40 percent throughout.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 to 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs or it is the cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogs of sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more or are the color of the uncoated sand grains.  Texture is like the A horizon described above.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has texture like the A horizon described above.  Some pedons have up to 50 percent ortstein in the Bhs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 3 or 4.  It has texture like the A horizon described above.  Some pedons have up to 50 percent ortstein in the Bs.\nThe BC or Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the A horizon described above.\nThe 2R horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 or 5."

The somewhat excessively drained Deerton soils are on similar landscape positions where the sandy mantle has less than 35 percent rock fragments.  The moderately well drained Morganlake soils are nearby in similar landscape positions where there is a 20 to 40 inch thick sandy mantle over loamy till.  The moderately well drained Odanah soils are nearby in similar landscape positions where there is very deep clayey till.  The excessively drained Redrim soils are nearby where the soil is less than 20 inches thick to sandstone."
