Blasdell, Brownsville, Cadosia, Cloverlick, Cardiff, Jubin, Highsplint, Warwick and Wyoming soils have bedrock at a depth of more than 40 inches.  Berks soils have more than 5 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section, and have rippable bedrock above 40 inches. Calvin soils have hue redder than 7.5YR throughout the cambic horizon. Judyville and Matewan soils have less than 55 percent silt in the Bw horizon. Keyesville (T) soils have a paralithic contact. Lippitt and Peaks soils average less than 40 percent silt in the fine-earth fraction of the control section. Nailkeg, and Sylco soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Manlius soils do not have measurable amounts of kaolinite in the clay fraction."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brownstown soils are on steep and very steep backslopes of hills and knobs. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. They formed in residuum from siltstone. The bedrock is from the upper part of the Spickert Knob Formation, Borden Group, in Indiana. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 114 cm (40 to 45 inches), the mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), frost free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 105 meters (345 feet) to 300 meters (1000 feet)."
