  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Babelthuap soils are primarily on backslopes of convex ridges and other erosional surfaces on hills of volcanic islands. Slope is 2 to 75 percent. The soils formed in saprolite derived from basalt, andesite, dacite, volcanic breccias, tuff, and bedded tuff. They are dominant under Fern Land plant communities.  Elevation is 1 to 234 meters (3 to 768 feet.) The climate is tropical and moist. Because of the strong marine influence, the diurnal and annual range of temperature is limited. Rainfall averages about 3685 millimeters (145 inches) per year and ranges from approximately 2900 to 4400 mm (114 to 173 in.) The seasonal wet (May to November) and dry seasons (December to April) with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 178 to 229 milliliters (7 to 9 inches) per month. Rainfall is derived from convective uplift, which results in short duration rainstorms of high intensity. Rainfall is irregularly distributed geographically. These soils lie within the latitudinal zone that receives more solar radiation than it re-radiates back to space. This imbalance maintains the atmospheric temperatures in a quasi-steady state. The mean daily temperature throughout the year averages 27 C (81 F) with a mean diurnal range of about 4 C (7 F.) Relative humidity averages about 90 percent at night and 75 to 80 percent during the day."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aimeliik, Ngardmau, and Palau soils. Aimeliik soils have a higher organic matter, fertility status, and cation exchange and are under forest vegetation. The Ngardmau soils are on erosional surfaces under degraded anthropic savannah vegetation and are 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) deep to solum (saprolite C-horizon.). They occur only on ridges, highly degraded, and support \"degraded\" savanna vegetation dominated by picture plants and false staghorn ferns, which high tolerates aluminum soils. Palau series are under grassland savannas dominated by pandanus and grasses. They have 9 to 12 percent and occur on ancient anthropogenic hillslope terraces."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are in fern-land plant communities and are used only for watershed. A few areas are used as a source for mining bauxite. The vegetation is degraded anthropic savannah consisting of poor stands of Gleichenia linearis, Nepenthea mirabilis, Ectrosia lepornia and Paspalum orbiculare, scattered shrubs and pandanus.\nThis plant community is commonly dominant with Gleicheinia sp. Other associates that may be found scattered if the ferns are still short and young include Lycopodium cernuum. If the area has not been subjugated to fire for a considerable amount of time then there is often nothing but Gleichienia or at least a considerable lower diversity then areas exposed to occasional fire. It is common to come across small pockets of these areas deep in the hills of the upland forest."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The surface layer becomes dry for short periods particularly during the months of February, March, and April, due to the high coarse fragment content. The soil does not meet the definition of an oxic horizon for the clay content increases by more than 8 percent within 15 centimeters (6 inches.) Gibbsite is aluminum hydroxide and it is the principal component of bauxite. It is the product of intense soil weathering and is very stable in the soil environment. Gibbsite does not contribute to the soluble aluminum in the soil because it is stable.\nSome agricultural crops suffer from aluminum toxicity when the Al saturation is only 10%. Aluminum interferes with the photosynthetic cycle by complexing with phosphate, so with high soluble aluminum the plant is starved for phosphate. Al-toxicity also stunts root growth thereby limiting the amount of soil the plant can exploit for nutrients. Stunted roots can also limit water uptake and can cause plants to wilt with only a few days without water. Some plants (e.g. cassava) have high tolerance to high levels of soluble aluminum. On the Babelthuap series, ferns that are highly tolerant to aluminum can make up nearly 100% of the plant community in places. High soluble Al and acidity may adversely affect soil health by inhibiting beneficial organisms. When liming soils with high soluble aluminum the rule of thumb is to add 1.5 tons of CaCO3 per acre for every milliequivalents of soluble aluminum. The pH only needs to be raised to about 5.5 to eliminate the harmful effects of high soluble aluminum.\nApparent field textures vary for tropical soils; therefore, field textures and their mid-point values of texture classes were used rather than laboratory analysis for particle size. Particle size distribution is difficult to determine in tropical soils because of the strong cohesion of aggregates and their tendency to suspend particles.  The poor dispersion reflects the water-stable aggregates of clay in silt and sand-sized \"particles.\" Therefore, the soils may have a lot of clay but physically they behave as coarser textures.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -Surface to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (A horizon)\nKandic horizon - 28 to 64 cm (11 to 25 inches) (Bo horizon)\nAbrupt textural change - 28 cm (11 inches)\nParticle-size control section - 25 to 100 cm (10 to 39 inches)\nSoil moisture regime subclass: typic\nSoil moisture regime class: perudic\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Data No. 79TQ632002, and Military Geology of Palau Islands, 1956, used to define the series.
