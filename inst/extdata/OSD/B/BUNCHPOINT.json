Kilmerque soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days, and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Lani soils are very deep to bedrock.  Lostcreek soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock, are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days, and are moderately well drained. Republic soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock and have 15 to 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section. Thrapp soils are 35 to 45 inches to a densic contact and redoximorphic features.\nThe Fren soils have a similar mixed mineralogy.  Fren soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock, have a mollic epipedon 20 to 35 inches thick, and have secondary carbonates at 20 to 35 inches."
