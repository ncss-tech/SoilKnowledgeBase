  "OVERVIEW": "The Bunchpoint series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on stable ridge slopes of plateaus. Bunchpoint soils formed in mixed ash, loess and colluvium derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
