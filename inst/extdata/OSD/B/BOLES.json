  "OVERVIEW": "The Boles series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt, andesite, greenstone, and similar rocks.  Boles soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 1 to 25 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
