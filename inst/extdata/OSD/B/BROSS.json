  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 30 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The soils typically are strongly acid to depths of more than 40 inches but in some pedons become somewhat less acid with increasing depth.  Base saturation ranges from 30 to 50 percent in the umbric epipedon and at least some subhorizon of the Bw horizon is less than 60 percent base saturated.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.  The particle size control section is usually gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam.  The fine earth fraction has 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Loamy sand or coarser textures are excluded from the above range.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume in a major part of the particle size control section and typically range in diameter from 1/4 to 10 inches.  The moisture control section is usually moist from\nsnow melt when the soil is not frozen.  The lower parts of the particle size control section may have up to 20 percent stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 through 6 moist, with chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.  Mottling of 7.5YR 4/6 is common at depths of 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bross soils are on alpine hills and ridges above timberline. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soil formed in parent sediments locally transported as slope wash or alluvial fan sediments from a mixture of crystalline rock.  Elevation ranges from 10,000 to 14,000 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 35 inches, most of which comes as snow.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 28 degrees F.  Frost-free season is less than 10 days."
