  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bross series consists of deep, well to moderately well drained soils that formed in slope wash or alluvial fan sediments from mixed crystalline rocks.  Bross soils are on alpine hills and ridges above timberline.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm and the mean annual temperature is about -2 degrees C.",
