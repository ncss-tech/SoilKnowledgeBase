  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of minesoil materials is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through moderately alkaline throughout.  Fragments of soft shale, fine-grained sandstone, and ironstone range from 0 to 5 percent.  Soft lignite fragments range from a trace to about 15 percent.  Texture is mostly loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, clay or silty clay with less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Fragments or masses of darker or lighter materials range from none to few.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Masses or mottles of gray, red or brown from the overburden material range from none to common.  It has masses or thin layers of varying textures."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Diswood, Distell, Gibboncreek, Grayrock and Thermo series.  Distell, Diswood, and Thermo  soils have fragments of diagnostic horizons within the control section.  In addition, the Distell soils have fine-loamy control sections and the Diswood and Thermo soils have fine control sections and are in the Udic moisture regime.  The Gibbonscreek soils have fine-loamy control sections and an EC of 1 to 5 mmhos/cm and exchangeable sodium percentage of more than 5 throughout.  Grayrock soils are in a Udic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bigbrown soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep slopes.  They are on mine spoil areas where lignite strip mining operations have taken place.  Slope gradients range from 1 to about 15 percent and are simple to complex, depending on how much the spoil piles have been smoothed or reclaimed.  Reclaimed areas have slopes that are gentle and fairly uniform over large tracts. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 64 degrees to 70 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 46 to 66.  Geology of the area is Wilcox formation of Tertiary age."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Bigbrown soils have previously been mapped a miscellaneous land type:  mined area.  The mining near the type location began about 1972 and the type location was mined in 1975.  The shale and lignite fragments in fresh overburden materials usually breaks down when weathered for only a few years.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches.\nParent materials - consist of lignite strip mine unoxidized overburden.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  PhD Thesis - Frank Michael Hons, TAMU, 1978; and MS Thesis - Eddie D. Bearden, TAMU, 1984.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU. S. A."
