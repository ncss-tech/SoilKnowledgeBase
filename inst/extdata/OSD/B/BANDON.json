  "OVERVIEW": "The Bandon series consists of well drained soils moderately deep to an ortstein pan that formed in marine and eolian sands on incised marine terraces.  Slope is 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil has a udic moisture regime, but has a short dry period of less than 45 days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to the cemented Bsm horizon is 20 to 36 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section is sandy loam or loam and averages 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mixed A and E colors are typical with a thin A horizon in some pedons.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam or loam and has thin layers in some pedons of 5 to 30 percent fine iron cemented nodules ranging from 2 to 10 millimeters.  The Bsm horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is weakly cemented or strongly cemented.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is fine sand through loam.  It is usually massive and compacted but is single grained and loose and contains thin (5-15 millimeters) weakly cemented wavy horizontal layers in some pedons; these are strong brown, brown, and light yellowish brown in color."

The soils formed in sandy alluvial and eolian deposits on old sand dune and back beach deposits.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 90 inches.  The  mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 180 to 300 days.  Bandon soils occur on the Pioneer geomorphic surface."
