    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crowshaw, Greenscombe, Laki, Odo and Tocaloma series. Crowshaw, Greenscombe, Laki and Odo soils have mean annual precipitation of less than 457 millimeters (18 inches). Crowshaw soils formed in alluvium and Laki soils formed in lacustrine sediments. Odo soils formed from basalt and typically contain minor amounts of ash and loess. Greenscombe and Tocaloma soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to a lithic or paralithic contact. In addition, Tocaloma soils have a frost-free season longer than 233 days and formed in sandstone and shale."

Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,980 meters (4,800 to 6,500 feet). The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with some snow. The mean annual precipitation is 940 to 1,092 millimeters (37 to 43 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. (50 to 54 degrees F.) The frost-free season is 122 to 233 days."
