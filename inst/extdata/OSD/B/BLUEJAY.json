Crowshaw, Greenscombe, Laki and Odo soils have mean annual precipitation of less than 457 millimeters (18 inches). Crowshaw soils formed in alluvium and Laki soils formed in lacustrine sediments. Odo soils formed from basalt and typically contain minor amounts of ash and loess. Greenscombe and Tocaloma soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to a lithic or paralithic contact. In addition, Tocaloma soils have a frost-free season longer than 233 days and formed in sandstone and shale."
