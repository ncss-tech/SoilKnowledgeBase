  "OVERVIEW": "The Bosville series consists of deep, moderately well drained,  very slowly permeable soils on uplands of the Cretaceous age.  These soils are on nearly level through moderately steep smooth  ridge and sideslopes of the Western Coastal Plains  (MLRA 133B).  They have a perched  water table in the fall to early spring.  Slopes are dominantly 3  to 8 but range from 0 to 15 percent.",
