  "OVERVIEW": "The Bull series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess over residuum weathered from rhyolite.  Bull soils are in swales on hills and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.",
