The soil between depths of about 6 and 20 inches is usually moist but is dry in all parts for about 105 to 130 days from about mid-June to mid-October.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has colors of 6/6, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/4 in hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR and 7.5YR 5/2, 4/2, 3/2, 3/4 and 5YR 4/6 or 3/4.

Elevations are 500 to 5,000 feet.  (Lower elevations are in Napa and Sonoma County, California.)  The climate has hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual rainfall is 30 to 75 inches.  Seasonal snowfall ranges from less than 5 inches to about 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 75 degrees F; mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 120 to 260 days.  The lower mean annual temperature and shorter frost-free season is in northern California north of the Sacramento Valley."
