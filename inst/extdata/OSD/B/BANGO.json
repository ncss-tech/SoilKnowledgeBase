  "OVERVIEW": "The Bango series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Bango soils are on basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 cm (A horizon).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 10 to 20 cm (Btn horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 100 cm (Btn, 2C1, 3C2, and 3C3 horizons and part of the 3Cy horizon).\nDendritic tufa resembles the caps of mushrooms in shape. This type of tufa was first defined by Russell in \"Geological History of Lake Lahontan\"; Dendritic tufa was precipitated from hot springs and deposited on the shoreline terraces of this ancestral lake.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon sampled as Bango has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID 77NV019007 (pedon # 78P0020).  This pedon is a taxadjunct to Bango because it has a gypsic horizon within 85 cm of the soil surface.\nUser Pedon ID: 2007NV001062.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
