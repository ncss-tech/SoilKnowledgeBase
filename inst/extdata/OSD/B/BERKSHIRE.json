  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mineral solum ranges from 41 to 91 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Texture of the fine-earth fraction of the mineral horizons is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Clay content averages 10% or less and silt content averages 40 percent or less in the particle size control section. The A and E horizons contain 5 to 20 percent gravel or channers, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones by volume. The Bhs, Bs, and BC horizons contain 5 to 35 percent gravel or channers, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent stones by volume. The C horizon contains 5 to 50 percent gravel or channers, 0 to 50 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent stones. The weighted average of rock fragments in the particle size controls sections is less than 35 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe O horizon, where present, consists of slightly, intermediately, and/or highly decomposed organic material.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR and value and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon up to 10 cm thick with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or less.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nStructure of the Bs and Bhs horizons is weak granular or subangular blocky. Maximum combined thickness of the spodic horizon is 41 cm.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.Some pedons have individual layers of loamy coarse sand or coarse sand below a depth of 100 cm. The C horizon is typically friable, but some pedons have discrete firm masses or strata."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bangor, Elliotsville, Groveton, Houghtonville, Penquis, Potsdam, and Tunbridge series. Houghtonville soils have a spodic horizon greater than 41 cm thick. Groveton soils formed in glaciofluvial material and have less gravel in the upper part of the solum. Penquis, Tunbridge, and Elliotsville soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Potsdam soils have an eolian or water deposited silty mantle 40 to 100 cm thick over a Cd layer formed in lodgment till. Bangor soils average more than 40 percent silt in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Berkshire soils are on nearly level to very steep slopes of hills and mountains on glaciated uplands. They are typically on convex parts of summits, shoulders, and backslopes. The soils formed in loamy, late Wisconsin aged, melt-out till derived mainly from schist, granite, gneiss, and phylitte. Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days."

Hermon soils are sandy-skeletal and are somewhat excessively drained. Lyman soils are shallow to bedrock and are somewhat excessively drained. Monadnock soils have sandy substrata. Marlow and Peru soils formed in lodgment till, and Peru is moderately well drained. Tunbridge soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Berkshire soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Sunapee and poorly drained Lyme soils."

The common trees are paper birch, eastern white pine, white ash, red pine, balsam fir, white spruce, sugar maple, yellow birch, and red spruce. Areas cleared of stones are used mainly for hay and pasture and some cultivated crops. A few areas are in urban use."
