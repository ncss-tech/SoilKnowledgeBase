  "OVERVIEW": "The Brundage series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in saline loamy alluvium. These soils are on drainageways and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 56 cm (21 in).",
