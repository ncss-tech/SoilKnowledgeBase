  "OVERVIEW": "The Bunton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvium derived from igneous rocks.  These soils are on nearly level basin floors.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 330 mm (13 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

These soils developed in clayey alluvium derived from igneous rocks.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 305 to 380 mm (12 to 15 inches).   Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon convective thunderstorms from June to September.  Precipitation during the months of December, January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the annual total.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 16.7 to 19.4 degrees C (62 to 67 degrees F), and frost-free period range from 210 to 250 days.  Elevation ranges from 1,070 to 1,525 m (3,500 to 5,000 feet)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Antbed (TX), Michigan (TX), and Verhalen (TX) series.  Antbed soils are on more proximal piedmont slope landforms and have an argillic horizon.  Michigan soils are on similar fan skirt and basin floor landforms, but formed in alluvium derived from limestone and have mixed mineralogy.  They support burrograss rather than tobosa vegetation.  Verhalen soils lie in more distal basin floor landforms and have slickensides."
