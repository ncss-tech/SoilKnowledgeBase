  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Wagonbow (AZ) series.  Wagonbow soils formed in colluvium on hillslopes and contain at least 5 percent cobbles.  Furthermore, they occur in areas with summer-winter bimodal precipitation pattern.  Wagonbow soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December through February and are dry in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bunton soils are on basin floors and fan skirts in semi-bolsons. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils developed in clayey alluvium derived from igneous rocks.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 305 to 380 mm (12 to 15 inches).   Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon convective thunderstorms from June to September.  Precipitation during the months of December, January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the annual total.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 16.7 to 19.4 degrees C (62 to 67 degrees F), and frost-free period range from 210 to 250 days.  Elevation ranges from 1,070 to 1,525 m (3,500 to 5,000 feet)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Antbed (TX), Michigan (TX), and Verhalen (TX) series.  Antbed soils are on more proximal piedmont slope landforms and have an argillic horizon.  Michigan soils are on similar fan skirt and basin floor landforms, but formed in alluvium derived from limestone and have mixed mineralogy.  They support burrograss rather than tobosa vegetation.  Verhalen soils lie in more distal basin floor landforms and have slickensides."
