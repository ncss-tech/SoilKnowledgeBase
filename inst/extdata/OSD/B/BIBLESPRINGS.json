  "OVERVIEW": "The Biblesprings series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks. These soils are on relict stream terraces, beach plains, and fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

Antelope Springs and Garbo soils have argillic horizons and usually occur at slightly lower elevations on the landscape. Bannion soils have an indurated duripan between a depth of 20 to 40 inches, are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section and occur on fan terraces upslope from the Biblesprings soils. Beryl soils do not have a calcic horizon. Manselo soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section. Escalante soils do not have silica cementation in the subsoil. Beryl, Manselo, and Escalante soils are intermixed on the landscape with the Biblesprings soils."

(A horizon and part of the Bw horizon.)\nCalcic horizon: A zone of carbonate accumulation from a depth of about 21 to 51 inches. (Bkq horizons)\nDurinodic feature: The soil has a subhorizon that is greater than 15 cm thick within 1 m of the surface that is brittle and has a firm consistency when moist. (Bkq horizons)\nXeric feature: the moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\".  The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data."
