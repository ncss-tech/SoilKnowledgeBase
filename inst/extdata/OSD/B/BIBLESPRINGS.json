  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Biblesprings soils are on relict stream terraces, beach plains, and fan remnants at elevations of 5,000 to 5,600 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Antelope Springs and Garbo soils have argillic horizons and usually occur at slightly lower elevations on the landscape. Bannion soils have an indurated duripan between a depth of 20 to 40 inches, are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section and occur on fan terraces upslope from the Biblesprings soils. Beryl soils do not have a calcic horizon. Manselo soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section. Escalante soils do not have silica cementation in the subsoil. Beryl, Manselo, and Escalante soils are intermixed on the landscape with the Biblesprings soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 7 inches. (A horizon and part of the Bw horizon.)\nCalcic horizon: A zone of carbonate accumulation from a depth of about 21 to 51 inches. (Bkq horizons)\nDurinodic feature: The soil has a subhorizon that is greater than 15 cm thick within 1 m of the surface that is brittle and has a firm consistency when moist. (Bkq horizons)\nXeric feature: the moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\".  The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
