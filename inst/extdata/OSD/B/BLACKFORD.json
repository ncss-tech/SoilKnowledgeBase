Soils in closely associated families are the Belknap, Cuba, Haymond, Sharon, and Wilbur series. Haymond, and Wilbur soils are nonacid. Belknap and Sharon soils have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less in the control section. Cuba soils average more than 18 percent clay in the control section."

Belknap and Bonnie soils are on lower portions of the floodplain, are more poorly drained and are dominated by lower chroma colors in the control section. The well drained Burnside, Clifty, and Skidmore soils contain more sand and rock fragments in the control section and are located upstream from Blackford soils on nearby floodplains or alluvial fans.  The moderately well drained Sharon soils have low chroma colors in the lower portion of the control section and are on similar positions further from the stream in the floodplain."
