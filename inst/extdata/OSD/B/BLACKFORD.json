  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The only competing series is the Hamplain series. Hamplain soils are formed in post glacial alluvium and are less acid in the subsoil. Soils in closely associated families are the Belknap, Cuba, Haymond, Sharon, and Wilbur series. Haymond, and Wilbur soils are nonacid. Belknap and Sharon soils have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less in the control section. Cuba soils average more than 18 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blackford soils are on nearly level flood plains. Slope gradients commonly are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 3 percent. Blackford soils formed in silty acid alluvium. Mean annual temperature varies from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 1118 to 1219 cm (44 to 48 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200 and elevation ranges from 100 to 152 meters (328 to 500 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely associated Belknap, Bonnie, Burnside, Clifty, Sharon, and Skidmore soils. Belknap and Bonnie soils are on lower portions of the floodplain, are more poorly drained and are dominated by lower chroma colors in the control section. The well drained Burnside, Clifty, and Skidmore soils contain more sand and rock fragments in the control section and are located upstream from Blackford soils on nearby floodplains or alluvial fans.  The moderately well drained Sharon soils have low chroma colors in the lower portion of the control section and are on similar positions further from the stream in the floodplain."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/second). These soils are subject to occasional to frequent flooding for very brief to brief periods in late winter and spring."
