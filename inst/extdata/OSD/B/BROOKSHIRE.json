  "OVERVIEW": "The Brookshire series consists of very deep, well drained, permeable soils that form in colluvium on the lower part of mountain slopes.  Elevation ranges from about 2,000 to 4,800 feet above sea level.  Slopes are dominantly 20 to 65 percent, but range from 7 to 65 percent.",

Fragments of phyllite, slate, sandstone, or quartzite range from 10 to 35 percent by volume throughout, but the amount normally increases with depth.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 3.  The fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam."

Jeffrey and Unaka soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Barbourville and Cutshin soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and are fine-loamy.  Crossville soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and have siliceous mineralogy.  Haywood and Transylvania soils have umbric epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Porters soils formed in residuum and are 40 to 60 inches to hard bedrock.  Tusquitee soils contain rock fragments dominated by igneous and metamorphic crystalline fragments such as granite, mica gneiss and schist.  Zenith soils have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Elevation ranges from about 2,000 to 4,800 feet above sea level.   The soil formed in local alluvium moved downslope from soil material formed from slate, arkosic sandstone, graywacke, phyllite, and probably granite, conglomerate, and quartzite in some places.  These soils are in areas having about 54 inches average annual rainfall and about 50 degrees to 55 degrees F.  average annual temperature."
