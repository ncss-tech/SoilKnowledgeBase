  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches. Depth to siltstone or shale bedrock (commonly black highly fissile shale) is 40 to about 100 inches. Sandstone, siltstone, or shale fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 0 to 40 percent in the C horizon. Reaction is strongly to extremely acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or N, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 3 or less. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon (where present) has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or N, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or less. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Btg horizons have hues of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less with redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red and gray. Texture is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe Cg or 2Cg horizons have hues of 10YR to 5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 2 or less or are variegated without dominant hue or chroma. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red and gray are common thoughout and are interspersed with lithochromic mottling derived from weathered black shale. Fine-earth texture is silty clay or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Mullins and Purdy series are in closely related families. Both Mullins and Purdy soils lack umbric epipedons. Mullins soils are fine-silty and have a fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blago soils are in ponded or depressed areas on uplands and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in alluvial sediments deposited over highly weathered black fissile shales. Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees Fahrenheit with a mean of 56 degrees. Annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 52 inches with a mean of 42 inches."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in pasture or hay. Some artificially drained areas are used for growing corn, soybeans and small grains; and a few areas remain in woodlaond. Native forests have water tolerant hardwoods such as willow, alder, elderberry, beech, gums, pin oak, water oak, swamp oak, red maple and box elder."
