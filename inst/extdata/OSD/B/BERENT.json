Quinton, Lachim, Painter, and Walco soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Goldrun soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 17 to 35 inches. Grandora soils are noncalcareous throughout the profile and have clay films. Hotsprings soils have 20 to 35 percent gravel in the particle size control section.  Incy soils are noncalcareous throughout the profile. Quincy soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 15 inches. Rinquin soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Toll soils are noncalcareous and are slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Winchester soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 20 to 30 inches and have more than 75 percent medium sand or coarser in the particle size control section.  Zorravista soils have appreciable amounts of vitric pyroclastic material throughout the profile."

Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevation is 4,500 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The freeze-free period is 100 to 150 days."
