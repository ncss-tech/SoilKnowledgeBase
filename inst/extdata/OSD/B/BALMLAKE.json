Bergkeller, Heyder, Sanburn, and Sugarbush soils have more than 60 percent fine sand and coarser in the argillic horizon.   Cunard, Flak, Milaca, Nadeau, Oconto, Omena, and Sanburn soils have argillic horizons that are 7.5YR or redder.  In addition, Cunard has bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Emmet soils have series control sections with reactions 6.6, neutral, or greater. Grytal soils have saturation in the lower third of the series control section.  Millward soils do not have free carbonates in the lower third of the series control section."
