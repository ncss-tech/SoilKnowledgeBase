  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 24 to 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates is 0 to 10 inches.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  The upper 10 inches of the series control section contains 0 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; the remainder of the profile has 5 to 30 percent.  Some pedons contain fragments of snail shells.  The series control section typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam or clay loam with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser is in some pedons.  The A horizon typically is free of rock fragments, but the lower part in some pedons contains up to 3 percent by volume.  The 2Cg horizon contains 1 to 8 percent rock fragments by volume.  Depth to 2Cg horizon ranges from 36 to 80 inches.  This soil is saturated in the moisture control section for more than 20 days following the summer solstice in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It has mottles in some pedons.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam, but in some pedons it is clay loam with less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser throughout.\nSome pedons have a Cg horizon with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures are silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly has distinct or prominent mottles.  Textures are loam or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Downata, Inkom, and Playmoor soils are not saturated in the moisture control section for more than 20 days following the summer solstice in most years.  Hallek soils do not have coarse fragments throughout the profile.    The Lamoure soils typically have buried A horizons within the series control section and are poorly drained.  The Rauville soils have a moderately rapid permeability below 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The  Bigstone soils have plane or concave slopes ranging from 0 to 1 percent in depressions on till plains.  They have primarily formed in calcareous local alluvium and the underlying calcareous, glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 27 inches.  The frost-free days range from 120 to 172.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 990 to 1950 feet."

The moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained Fram, Hamerly, and Svea soils are on low convex rises, concave foot slopes, and side slopes.  The poorly drained Lakepark and Vallers soils are in drainageways and on flats."
