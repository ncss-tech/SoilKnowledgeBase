The moderately well drained Glennie soils and well drained Hottis soils are on nearby till plains and moraines. The moderately well drained Nester and Ossineke soils are on the same landforms as the Bamfield soils on the less sloping areas. The Glennie soils have fragipans and contain less clay in the argillic horizon. The Hottis and Nester soils contain more clay in the argillic horizon. The very poorly drained Lupton soils are in closed depressions on moraines."
