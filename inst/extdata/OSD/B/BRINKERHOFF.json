  "OVERVIEW": "The Brinkerhoff series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium from sandstone and gypsiferous shale.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",
