    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the buried glacial till material (3Bwb horizon) is 20 to 40 inches.   Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.   The 20 to 40 inch thick ash mantle contains 75 to 85 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention is 70 to 90 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 2 to 4 percent and 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 5 to 12 percent.  The glacial till material contains 50 to 75 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention is 80 to 100 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 3 to 5 percent and 15-bar water content on undried samples is 10 to 18 percent and on dried samples is 7 to 15 percent.  The soil moisture control section is usually moist and is dry in all parts for 30 to 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The thickness of the umbric epipedon is 15 to 25 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry with chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is 5 to 15 percent clay (estimated).  It contains 0 to 5 percent subrounded gravel.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 40 to 50 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR and value of 2 to 4 moist and 3 to 5 dry with chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 to 6 dry.  It is mixed or stratified ashy loamy fine sand and ashy fine sand or ashy fine sandy loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent clay (estimated).  It contains 0 to 5 percent subrounded gravel.   It is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons will contain 2C horizons with a layer of black scoria.\nThe 3Bwb horizon has hue of 10YR and value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very stony or extremely stony ashy loam or ashy sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent subrounded gravel, 10 to 30 percent subrounded cobbles and 15 to 30 percent subrounded stones.  Total rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent.  It is 10 to 25 percent clay (estimated).  It is slightly acid or neutral."
