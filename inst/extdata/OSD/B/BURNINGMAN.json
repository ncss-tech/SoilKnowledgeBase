  "OVERVIEW": "The Burningman series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from basalt and andesite. Burningman soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
