  "OVERVIEW": "The Bioya series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess over alluvium derived from basalt and other volcanic rocks. They are on fan piedmont remnants and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
