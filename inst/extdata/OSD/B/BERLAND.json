Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,400 to 9,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Akhoni soils are 10 to 20 inches to sandstone, are wooded, and lack argillic horizons.  Bikeyah soils are very deep, somewhat poorly drained, lack argillic horizons and occur on adjacent toeslopes.  Captom soils are deep, have sandy epipedons and occur on steep backslopes.  Klizhin soils are deep and very deep, lack argillic horizons, and occur on footslopes.  Retaw soils are very poorly drained and have standing water on the surface."
