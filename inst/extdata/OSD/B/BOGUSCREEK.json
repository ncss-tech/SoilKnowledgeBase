  "OVERVIEW": "The Boguscreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils which are deep or very deep to sandy outwash.  These soils formed in silty alluvium underlain by sandy outwash on drainageways on valley trains.  Permeability is moderate in the silty alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the silty alluvium and the depth to sandy outwash ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 24 or more inches thick.  Weighted average total sand content ranges from 5 to 30 percent in the silty alluvium but the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Rock fragments are typically absent in the silty alluvium but volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the sandy outwash.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Surface texture is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6, or it is multicolored. It is coarse sand, sand, or the gravelly analogs. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Near the Type Location these include the Chaseburg, Chelsea, Finchford, Plainfield, and Rasset series.  The well drained Chaseburg soils are higher in the landscape on toeslopes of hills.  Chaseburg soils formed in lighter colored silty alluvium and are not underlain by sandy outwash within 80 inches.  The excessively drained Chelsea soil formed on dunes in more than 80 inches of fine sand with lamellae.  The somewhat excessively drained Rasset soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy alluvium underlain by sandy outwash to a depth of 60 inches or more.  The excessively drained Finchford and Plainfield soils formed in sandy outwash more than 60 inches thick.  Near the Type Location, the Finchford soils are on treads of valley trains and the Plainfield soils are on risers of valley trains."
