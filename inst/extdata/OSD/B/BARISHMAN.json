  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F and mean summer temperature is about 56 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 15 to 50 inches but is not shallower than the upper 4 inches of the B2t horizon.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 50 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically clay but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 45 percent, and sand from 15 to 45 percent with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Reaction ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction ranges from about 4 to 14 percent.  It is clay or heavy clay loam and has more than 35 percent clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Coalmont and Phillips series.  Coalmont soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Phillips soils have thinner A2 horizons, continuous A&B horizons, and thick skeletons on the surfaces of peds in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barishman soils are on upland hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in old alluvial sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F and the average summer temperature is 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 35 to 50 days."

Boettcher soils lack an abrupt textural boundary between the A and B2t horizons and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
