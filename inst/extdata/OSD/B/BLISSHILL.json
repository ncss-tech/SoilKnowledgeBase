  "OVERVIEW": "The Blisshill series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils in concave areas on basalt plateaus and mesas.  Blisshill soils formed in weathered loess.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
