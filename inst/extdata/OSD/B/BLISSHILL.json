Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 3,900 to 5,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches but these soils received additional moisture from runon from surrounding areas.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. and the frost free period is 85 to 100 days."
