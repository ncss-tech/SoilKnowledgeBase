  "REVDATE": "08/2002",
  "STATES": "ID,MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bozeman series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess derived from mixed alluvial sources on nearly level to moderately sloping plains and dissected sideslopes of mountain valleys. Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The climate is cool subhumid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 38 degrees to 45 degrees F. The average frost-free period is less than 110 days.",

It is silt loam or light silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has 18 to 35 percent clay, 30 to 70 percent silt, and 10 to 50 percent sand of which less than 15 percent is fine sand or coarser. It has moderate or strong prismatic, blocky or prismatic and blocky structure.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons are silt loam or light silty clay loam and have faint to prominent accumulations of filaments or soft masses of calcium carbonate with calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from about 2 to 12 percent.
