The solum is neutral or slightly alkaline. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is silt loam or light silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has 18 to 35 percent clay, 30 to 70 percent silt, and 10 to 50 percent sand of which less than 15 percent is fine sand or coarser. It has moderate or strong prismatic, blocky or prismatic and blocky structure.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons are silt loam or light silty clay loam and have faint to prominent accumulations of filaments or soft masses of calcium carbonate with calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from about 2 to 12 percent. It is moderately or strongly alkaline."
