  "OVERVIEW": "The Big Timber series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone. They are on hills. Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
