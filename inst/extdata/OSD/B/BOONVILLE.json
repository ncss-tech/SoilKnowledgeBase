  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60  to about 80 inches.  Cracks.4 of an inch or more wide and more than 12 inches deep are in the Btg horizon when dry.  Pressure faces and small slickensides range from few to many in some part of the argillic horizon. The upper boundary of the subsoil has amplitude of waviness of3 to 30 inches between the subsoil crests and the subsoil troughs, with the length of cycle ranging from 3 to 8 feet. Troughs commonly form an uphill-downhill configuration with depressions within the troughs.  Siliceous and ironstone pebbles range from none to about 5 percent throughout\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Where value is 3 or less the horizon is less than 7 inches thick. Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  The boundary between the A and Bt is abrupt over the subsoil crests and clear in the subsoil troughs.  An E horizon is common in the subsoil troughs, but is absent on most subsoil crests.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The epipedon ranges  from 3 inches thick over subsoil crests to about 30 inches thick over subsoil troughs.  But, dominantly ranges between 10 and 20 inches thick. Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray and red range from few to common.  Typically, subsoil crests are more mottled than subsoil troughs.  The texture is clay or clay loam with clay content of 35 to 55 percent.  The reaction of the Btg1 ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Lower Btg horizons range from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have Btk horizons in shades of brown or gray with or without redoximorphic features.  Carbonates range from 1 to 5 percent and the reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BCt horizon has matrix colors in shades of brown or gray.  Redoximorphic features in these colors and in shades of red or yellow range from few to many and some pedons have a mottled matrix.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has colors in shades of brown, gray or yellow.  It is loamy or shaly materials of the Yegua Geology.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam or clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Soils in similar families include the Lufkin, Mabank, Tabor, Wilson and Zulch series.  The Lufkin, Mabank, Wilson, and Zulch soils are in a vertic subgroup but do not have ruptic properities. In addition Wilson soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the epipedon and argillic horizon.  Also, Zulch soils have solum 40 to 60 inches thick over shale.   Tabor soils have matrix colors with chroma of more than 3 in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boonville soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands of colluvial or alluvial origin.  The soils formed in clayey and loamy sediments derived from partly weathered Eocene Age Formations, mainly the Yegua.  These soils occupy depositional concave footslopes and planar backslopes adjacent to smooth shallow tributaries.   The mean annual temperature ranges from66 to 69 degrees F., average annual precipitation ranges from36 to 42 inches.  The elevation ranges from 250 to 350 feet above sea level and the frost free days range from 270 to 280.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from60 to 68."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Mabank, Tabor and Zulch series and the Gredge and Zack series.  The Mabank soils are on slightly lower positions. The Tabor and the Gredge soils are on lower terrace positions but typically with convex surfaces.  The Zack and Zulch series are on higher positions.  Zack soils have brownish and reddish colors in the argillic horizon and are underlain by softshale at a depth of 25 to 40 inches."
