  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 32 inches.  The depth to loose sand and gravel which is 20 to 50 percent gravel, is typically about 25 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 32 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and 2 moist.  It is loam or silt loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It averages between 18 and 28 percent clay and is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand or gravelly loamy sand.  Some pedons have a loamy sand texture below depths of 40 inches.  It contains up to 15 percent fragments of shale.  The pebbles especially in the upper part, are crusted with carbonates on the undersides.  The 2C horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bowdle soils are on outwash plains and terraces of streams that dissect till plains.  Surfaces are plane or slightly concave.  Slope gradients typically are less than 6 percent, but range to 15 percent.  The soil formed in loamy alluvium underlain by stratified sands and gravels.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 18 inches.  Most of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bowbells, Divide, Flaxton, Lehr, Parshall, Stady, Wabek and Williams soils.  Bowbells, Flaxton, Parshall and Williams soils do not have sand and gravel within depths of 40 inches and are on nearby uplands.  Divide soils have calcic horizons within 16 inches.  Lehr soils have sand and gravel within depths of 20 inches.  Stady soils have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick.  Divide, Lehr and Stady are on similar landscapes.  Wabek soils have sand and gravel within 14 inches of the surface and are on steeper slopes."

Where the series has previously been correlated in association with residual landforms, it will be recorrelated in the future to the Stady series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
