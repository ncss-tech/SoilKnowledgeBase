  "REVDATE": "06/2004",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beemont series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from cherty materials mixed with residuum from shale and some sandstone overlying bedrock.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

It is silt loam or loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues or cobbly very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly loam or cobbly very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to extremely acid.\nA gravelly or very gravelly BE horizon or B/E horizon, 2 to 6 inches thick, is present in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 4 to 8; and chroma of 2 to 8.  The upper part is clay with amounts of clay ranging from 60 to 85 percent and the content of coarse fragments ranging from 0 to 15 percent. The lower part is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay or their gravelly or cobbly analogs. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the lower half. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout the 2Bt, but can range to moderately alkaline in the layer immediately above bedrock.\nSome pedons have C or Cr horizons that are clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or their channery analogues."
