  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 3 to 5, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues or cobbly very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly loam or cobbly very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to extremely acid.\nA gravelly or very gravelly BE horizon or B/E horizon, 2 to 6 inches thick, is present in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 4 to 8; and chroma of 2 to 8.  The upper part is clay with amounts of clay ranging from 60 to 85 percent and the content of coarse fragments ranging from 0 to 15 percent. The lower part is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay or their gravelly or cobbly analogs. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the lower half. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout the 2Bt, but can range to moderately alkaline in the layer immediately above bedrock.\nSome pedons have C or Cr horizons that are clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or their channery analogues."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Series in similar families are the Bardley, Doniphan, Gatewood, Goss, and Macedonia series.  Swiss, Doniphan, Goss, and Macedonia soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock.  Bardley and Gatewood soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beemont soils are on upland side slopes and less commonly on summit positions.  The slope gradient commonly is 9 to 14 percent, but ranges from 3 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from cherty materials mixed with residuum from shale and some sandstone overlying bedrock.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Union and Lebanon soils on the ridgetops; and the Gasconade, Gatewood, and Bucklick soils which are on lower landscape positions.  Union and Lebanon soils have fragipans.  Gasconade soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock. Bucklick soils are fine."
