  "OVERVIEW": "The Burnborough series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks. Burnborough soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Closkey and Devils soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Dutchjohn soils are deep to a paralithic contact and have a Bq horizon above the argillic.  Gowjai soils have a Cq horizon with up to 15 percent durinodes.  Granipeak soils contain more than 50 percent sand in the control section.  Jivas soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Millan soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September and have the base of the argillic horizon at depths of 25 to 50 cm.  Sumine soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Torro soils have more than 60 percent gravel in the Bt2 horizon."
