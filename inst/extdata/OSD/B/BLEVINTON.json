  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 13 to 20 inches and depth to the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 50 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 36 to more than 60 inches.  The major part of the solum and C horizon above a depth of 60 inches has hue of 7.5 YR or yellower.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above a depth of 60 inches and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.  These soils occur in concave areas and receive additional water during periods of spring runoff, and are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically sandy loam but averages 8 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically sandy loam of less than 18 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Blevinton soils are on gently to moderately sloping concave alluvial fans and small drainageways where winter snows accumulate and stay in the early spring.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 12 percent.  The soil formed in thick, noncalcareous, alluvial fan materials derived from sedimentary bedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Soil moisture supplies are substantially increased by snow accumulations.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F and mean summer temperature is 55 degrees F."
