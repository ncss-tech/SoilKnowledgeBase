    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Exchangeable sodium saturation ranges from 15 to 50 percent in all horizons below a depth of 16 inches.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E2 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.  Tongues of the E2 horizon extend into the lower B2t horizon.  A few accumulations of very dark or dark gray clay typically occur in discontinuous varve like bands within the A2 horizon, or as coating on the tops and sides of prisms or columns.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has the same color range as the upper part, or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of yellow, brown, and gray.  The Bt horizon ranges from medium acid to strongly alkaline.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Carbonate concretions in subhorizons of the B horizon range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has the same color and textural range as the Bt horizon.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline."

Additionally, McCrory and Rosella soils have fine loamy textures.  Fountain and Frost soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout the B horizon.  Lafe and Wing soils have color values of 3 or more throughout the B horizon.  Additionally Wing soils have fine textured control sections."
