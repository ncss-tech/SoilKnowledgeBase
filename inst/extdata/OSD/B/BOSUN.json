  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bosun soils are found on predominately north aspects under continuous stands of oak and chaparral. They formed in quartz-diorite and diorite porphyry on complex side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains. This area contains some andesite dikes and fishers. Typically Bosun soils occur on lower portions of side slopes, concave shaped slopes and those where colluvium will accumulate. Slopes range from 35 to 75 percent. Elevations are from sea level to 1732 feet (0 to 528 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with potential fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 17 inches (178 to 432 mm), the mean annual temperature is 59 to 66 degrees F. (15 to 19 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 355 to 365 days."

Loadline soils are shallow and generally found on convex slope positions like crests of interfluves. Oboship and Express soils are coarse-loamy and predominately on the upper portions of slopes on interfluves."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series name is coined.\nBosun soils are isothermic borderline isomesic. The iso classification dictates the moisture regime to not be xeric. These soils are possibly in the Aridic subgroup. Moisture control section data is needed for this classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic horizon--The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 14 inches (35 centimeters) (A horizons). The O and surface A horizons are typically hydrophobic.\nArgillic horizon--14 to 47 inches (35 to 120 cm)(Bt horizons).\nThe particle size class for this series is formed by both colluvium of coarse material and profiles residuum, where the fractured diorite is so prevalent it constitutes the majority of the profile.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
