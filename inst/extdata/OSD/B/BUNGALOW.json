  "OVERVIEW": "The Bungalow series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter."
