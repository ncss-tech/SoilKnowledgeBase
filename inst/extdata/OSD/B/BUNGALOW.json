These soils are usually moist, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter."
