  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellecanyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in outwash over till derived from granitic rocks. The Bellecanyon soils are on moraines of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
