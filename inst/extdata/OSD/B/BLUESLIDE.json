The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  The control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay, l5 to 35 percent coarser than very fine sand, and 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of l or 2 dry or moist.\nThe ACg horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.\nThe Cg horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of l to 3 dry or moist.  It is stratified silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or fine sandy loam with lenses of clay loam, sandy clay loam, and volcanic ash in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

They formed in alluvium of mixed mineralogy from acid igneous rocks, lacustrine sediments, volcanic ash, and loess. Elevations are 2,000 to 3,000 feet.  These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.
