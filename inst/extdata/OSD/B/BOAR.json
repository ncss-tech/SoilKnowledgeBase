  "OVERVIEW": "The Boar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, shale and siltstone.  Boar soils are on hills.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
