  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckman series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from hard marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on continental glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes  are 15 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The mean winter soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry for 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic soil moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties and 45 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3 or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, and extremely cobbly medial sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter."
