  "OVERVIEW": "The Blanconia series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on terraces of streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
