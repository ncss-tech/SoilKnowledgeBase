Depth to limestone bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe average annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak to moderate, very fine to coarse granular structure. It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is dominantly cobbly silty clay loam or cobbly clay loam.  It has more than 18 percent clay and more than 35 percent cobble and gravel by volume. Its structure is dominantly moderate medium subangular blocky, but ranges to weak coarse subangular blocky.  It has few to many thin  clay films on surfaces of peds. It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Btk horizon has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bickmore soils occur on very steep north and east facing mountain slopes at elevations of 6,000 to 8,000 feet. Slope ranges from 5 to 70 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone. The average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 38 degrees to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
