  "OVERVIEW": "The Blindspring series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in ashy alluvium.  Blindspring soils are on nearly level to gently sloping valley floors near upland volcanic formations with slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of the soil is 152 cm or more.  The soil between depths of 25 to 100 cm is usually dry from the end of April through November, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time; typic aridic moisture regime.  The soil temperature is above 8 degrees C. from March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below 5 degrees C.  The mean annual soil temperature is 15 to 18 degrees C.  Ash content is 60 to 90 percent. The dry bulk density ranges from 1.10 to 1.25 g/cc and the moist bulk density is 1.30 to 1.45 g/cc.  Soil reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/3, 7/2 or 7/3 and moist color is 10YR 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Textures are loamy sand and gravelly loamy sand.  Up to 2 percent cobbles are present in some pedons.  The A1 horizon contains 15 to 30 percent pumice gravel and the A2 horizon contains 5 to 15 percent pumice gravel.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the A horizon.  Textures are loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand with 10 to 25 percent pumice gravel.  Up to 2 percent cobbles are present in some pedons.  Stratification is present in some pedons."

The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, some as snow, and the mean annual temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C.  The mean January temperature is about 3 degrees C.; the mean July temperature is about 24 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."

The soil lacks subsurface diagnostic horizons because of massive structure, no clay films and loamy sand textures.\n3. Mineralogy:  It is ashy (verified by the NSSL, Lincoln Nebraska)."
