  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum is 10 to 30 inches.  The estimated mean annual sol temperature ranges from about 59 to 68 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry for 6 months or more during most years, mainly during the spring, summer and autumn; and are low in organic matter. The soil is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and is calcareous throughout.  Fine salt and gypsum segregations occur in the B2t and C horizons in some pedons, but are not diagnostic of the series.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam or gravelly or very gravelly loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.   t is gravelly or very gravelly loam, heavy sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and averages more than 35 percent coarse fragments by volume, mostly pebbles and cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10 YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly or very cobbly sand that may have thin strata of very gravelly sandy loam. Lime coatings are on the pebbles and cobbles in the Cca horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bitter Spring, and Pinaleno series in the same family.  Bitter Spring soils have solum thickness of 5 to 10 inches.  Pinaleno soils are noneffervescent in the A and upper Bt horizons and are slightly acid to mildly alkaline to a depth of 12 inches. Chuckawalla, Cristobal and Pinamt soils have temperatures warmer than 72 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bitter soils are on dissected old fans, between the low more recent fans and the toe slopes of steep and very steep hills and mountains at elevations of 2,500 to 3,600 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 15 percent but range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, limestone and quartzite.  The climate is arid.  Estimated precipitation is 4 to 7 inches.  Mean annual temperature is between 59 and 64 degrees F.  Average January temperature is about 39 to 42 degrees F, and average July temperature is about 80 to 84 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 200 to 260 days."

Arizo, Cajon and Bluepoint soils lack an argillic horizon.  Cave soils lack an argillic horizon and are shallow to a strongly cemented pan.  Nickel and Rillino soils lack an argillic horizon and have a calcic horizon.  Blackmount soils are sandy-skeletal."
