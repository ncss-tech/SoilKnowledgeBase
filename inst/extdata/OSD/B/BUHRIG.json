  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Buhrig series consists of moderately deep, well drained soil formed in residuum and colluvium from igneous and metasedimentary rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on mountain ridges and knobs. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 900 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.(6 degrees C.).",
