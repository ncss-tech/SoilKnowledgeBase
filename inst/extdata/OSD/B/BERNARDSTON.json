  "OVERVIEW": "The Bernardston series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in till derived mainly from dark gray phyllite, slate, or schist.  The soils are moderately deep to dense till.  They are nearly level to very steep soils on uplands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and low to moderately high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness commonly ranges from 20 to 30 inches and generally is the same as the depth to the dense substratum.  The solum is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand. The volume of rock fragments larger than 3 inches ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 10 percent in the B and C horizons.  Rock fragments smaller than 3 inches range from 5 to 25 percent in the A and B horizons, and 5 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid except where limed.\nSome pedons have an O horizon 1 to 4 inches thick.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 1 to 3 inches thick that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Hue of 7.5YR is restricted to the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The Bw horizon has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure or weak, fine or medium subangular blocky structure and very friable or friable consistence.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with characteristics similar to the lower part of the Bw.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak or moderate, medium platy structure or it is massive.  Fine-earth texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is firm or very firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Amostown soils are underlain by stratified very fine sand or silt within a depth of 40 inches.  Broadbrook soils have a lithologic discontinuity at the top of the substratum.  Horseneck soils do not have dense materials in the substratum. Scituate soils have sandy substrata. Nantucket soils have a lithologic discontinuity and formed in till mixed with Pleistocene Age silts and clays.  Paxton soils have less than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand in the solum.  Wethersfield soils have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR in the B horizon."

The soils formed in acid, dense till derived mainly from dark gray phyllite, shale, slate, and schist.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days."

Kearsarge and Nassau soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches.  The moderately well drained Pittstown, the poorly drained Stissing, and the very poorly drained Mansfield soils are associated in a drainage sequence.  Quonset and Warwick soils are on outwash plains, terraces, eskers, and kames."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Cation exchange activity class was determined from a review of available data and similar soils.\nThe Second Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Agricultural Handbook 436 (1999) distinguishes a shallow soil depth class family based upon the presence of a densic contact at a depth less than 50 cm. from the mineral soil surface.  Soils correlated and/or published as the Bernardston series prior to 1996 may have included what would now be classified as a shallow family of Oxyaquic Dystrudepts. These soils are of minor extent throughout the range of the Bernardston series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - from 6 to 20 inches (Bw horizons).\n3. Densic material - unaltered very firm and firm basal till at a depth of 20 to 65 inches (Cd horizon).\n4. Oxyaquic feature - based upon saturation in one or more layers within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface, for one month or more per year, in 6 out of 10 years.  A perched water table is at 18 to 24 inches February to April.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data for samples S93MA011005, S78NH005024, S77NH019001, and S68VT021005. Analyzed by the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
