  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 18 to 25 cm in thickness.  Free carbonates typically are at the surface or are in all parts of the upper 18 cm when mixed.  The rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 10 percent throughout.  The control section averages between 15 and 40 percent of fine sand and coarser particles. Stony and wooded phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically loam or clay loam but includes cobbly loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 25 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has few to many segregations of lime.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 20 percent.\nSome pedons have redoximorphic features in the lower Bk and C horizons that may or may not be relic."

The Buse soils formed in calcareous till of the Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature is about 2 to 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 to 600 mm.  Frost free days are 110 to 150 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 300 to 760 meters."

Aastad and Svea soils have cambic horizons and thicker mollic epipedons.  Barnes, Flom, Forman, Vienna and Waukon soils have Bw or Bt horizons, thicker sola and lack free calcium carbonate in the upper part of solum.  Hamerly soils have aquic moisture regimes and have lower chroma in the upper part of the C horizon.  Langhei soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Sioux soils are coarse textured and excessively drained."
