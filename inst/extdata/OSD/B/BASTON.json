Baston and Abston series were originally separated by moisture regime subclass, but are now both ustic-aridic; the differences in secondary gypsum and carbonates may not adequately separate these soils, hence these series may need to be combined.\nGiarch and Obadia soils do not have a paralithic contact."

The soils formed in residuum derived from shale, commonly of the Bridger formation.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 7 to 11 inches.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  Frost-free period is 75 to 95 days."
