  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F.  Average summer soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle is 3 to 6 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 6 to 15 percent clay.  Depth to the lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Some pedons have a 2BC horizon.\nThe A horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has values of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very channery sandy loam or very flaggy sandy loam.  It has 25 to 40 percent channers and 0 to 20 percent flagstones.\nThe 2C horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very channery sandy loam, very flaggey sandy loam, or extremely channery sandy loam.  It has 30 to 45 percent channers and 5 to 20 percent flagstones."

Caseypeak soils have a paralithic contact above a lithic contact and have an ustic moisture regime.  Cobblank soils lack andic soil properties in the A horizon and have a subarctic-continental climate.  Hotter and Pendergrass soils lack an O horizon and do not have andic soil properties in the A horizon.  Illiano soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Jarbidge soils lack andic soil properties in the A horizon and are dry for more than 60 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  Merino and Sigbird soils do not have andic properties in the A horizon and have an ustic moisture regime.  Treebutte soils are dominated by angular granitic rock fragments and have 2 to 6 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Banker soils are on shoulders, ridges and back slopes of mountains.  Elevation ranges from 4,400 to 5,900 feet.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary rock consisting of interbedded sandstone and shale with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
