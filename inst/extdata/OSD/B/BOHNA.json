    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock ranges from 40 to 73 inches.  The soil between depths of about 7 and 20 inches usually becomes moist in all parts in late October or November and remains moist until mid-May.  The soil is dry in all parts the rest of the year.  Mean annual soil temperature varies from 59 to 62 degrees F.  Base saturation ranges from 80 to 100 by (NH4OAc) throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR or 7.5YR 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4, and moist color of 10YR or 7.5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loam or sandy loam.  It is weak or moderate granular.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR or 7.5R 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, or 6/6, and moist color of 10YR or 7.5YR 4/4, 4/7, 5/4, or 5/6.  It is sandy clay loam or loam with strong or moderate subangular blocky structure, or some may be massive.  Percent clay averages from 20 to 25 throughout the upper 20 inches of this horizon.  This horizon has less than 15 to 20 percent angular sand fragments.  It is neutral or slightly acid."

Ballard soils have clay loam or sandy clay loam B2t horizons which contain 20 to 35 percent siliceous shale fragments.  Chualar soils contain 20 to 25 percent angular sand fragments in the B2t horizon.  In addition Chualar soils formed in alluvium on slopes of less than 9 percent.  Gilroy soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Pinto soils have an A2 horizon with an abrupt lower boundary.  Shimmon and Soper soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tehachapi soils have B2t horizons averaging 25 to 35 percent clay."
