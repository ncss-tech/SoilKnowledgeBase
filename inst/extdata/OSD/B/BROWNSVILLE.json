  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownsville series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from fractured siltstone and very fine-grained sandstone. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Coarse fragments mainly are thin flat fragments of siltstone or very fine-grained sandstone less than 15 cm in length but range to 38 cm in length. Fragments range from 5 to 35 percent in the A horizon, from 15 to 85 percent in subhorizons of the B horizon, and from 25 to 90 percent in the C horizon. (Coarse fragments greater than 75mm range from 5 to 40 percent by weight in the B horizon and 15 to 60 percent by weight in the C horizon.) Bedrock is commonly fractured siltstone or very fine-grained sandstone with many voids about 10 to 25 cm apart.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5 (4 to 7 dry), and chroma of 1 to 4. The A or Ap horizon is silt loam, channery silt loam, or very channery silt loam. It is slightly acid to extremely acid.\nThe E or EB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, channery silt loam, or very channery silt loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is channery, very channery, extremely channery, flaggy, very flaggy, or extremely flaggy analogues of silt loam or loam with about 8 to 18 percent clay and less than 40 percent sand. Thin subhorizons of sandy loam, silty clay loam, and their channery analogues are present in some pedons. It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6. It is channery, very channery, extremely channery, flaggy, very flaggy, or extremely flaggy analogues of silt loam, or loam. It is moderately acid to extremely acid."

Berks, Brownstown, Calvin, Matewan, Peaks, and Sylco soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 cm. Blasdell soils have coarse fragments dominated by shale. Chiswell soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 51 cm. Highsplint soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the control section. Wyoming soils contain more than 50 percent coarser than very fine sand and contain rounded fragments from differing lithologies."
