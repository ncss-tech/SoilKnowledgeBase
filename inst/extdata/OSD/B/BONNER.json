  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bonner soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,200 feet. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent on the terraces and 15 to 65 percent on the escarpments. These soils formed in glacial outwash material derived dominantly from granite, gneiss, and schist. They have a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dufort, Hoodoo, Kaniksu, Kootenai, Pend Oreille, Rathdrum, and Treble soils. Dufort, Pend Oreille, and Treble soils are on foothills and lack sandy-skeletal textures within a depth of 40 inches. Hoodoo soils are on valley bottoms and flood plains and are poorly drained. Kaniksu soils are on terraces and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments within a depth of 40 inches. Kootenai soils are on terraces and have a thicker A horizon and contain less volcanic ash in the surface layers. Rathdrum soils are in swales on terraces and contain high amounts of volcanic ash and have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the profile."
