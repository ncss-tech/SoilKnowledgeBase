  "OVERVIEW": "The Blanchard series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian material.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and hills. Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
