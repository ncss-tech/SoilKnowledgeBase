  "REVDATE": "05/2006",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bartmus series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rock.  Bartmus soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
