  "OVERVIEW": "The Burton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridges and side slopes at high elevations in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B. They formed in residuum that is affected in the upper part by soil creep, and weathered from felsic to mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 80 inches. Slope ranges from 2 to 95 percent.",

Flakes of mica are few or common throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3, or hue of N and value of 2 or 3. The A horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Colors with value and chroma of 3 derived from parent material rather than a high organic matter content.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is similar in color and texture to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, is saprolite that is commonly fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. It is multicolored or similar in color to the Bw and BC horizons.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is weathered felsic to mafic, igneous or high grade metamorphic bedrock. It is partially consolidated but can be dug with difficulty with hand tools. Cementation is weak or moderate. Roots are commonly present and are in cracks and seams spaced more than 4 inches apart.\nThe R horizon is hard felsic to mafic, igneous or high-grade metamorphic bedrock. Horizontal spacing of cracks is 4 inches or more. Cementation is commonly indurated."

Cataloochee soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Guyot soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Breakneck, Cataloochee, Guyot, and Oconaluftee soils formed in residuum weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks. Tanasee soils formed in colluvium on benches, fans, and toeslopes. Wayah soils are very deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Burton soils are on ridges and side slopes. Elevation commonly ranges from about 4800 to 6600 feet. On north and east aspects this soil may occur at somewhat lower elevations. Slopes range from 2 to 95 percent. Burton soils formed in residuum that is affected in the upper part by soil creep, and weathered from felsic to mafic, high-grade metamorphic rocks such as granite, gneiss, mica gneiss, hornblende gneiss, and high-grade metagraywacke, . Mean annual precipitation ranges from is about 60 to 110 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual soil temperature is approximately 46 degrees F. near the type location. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days, and length of the growing season is about three months. Moist atmospheric conditions in the form of fog and cloud cover are prevalent throughout the year in these high mountain areas."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Tanasee and Wayah series, these are the Balsam, Clingman, Craggey, and Longhope series. Balsam soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Clingman and Craggey soils have hard bedrock within a depth of 20 inches. Longhope soils are very poorly drained and have organic horizons 16 to 30 inches thick overlying mineral soil material. Balsam soils formed in colluvium on toe slopes, benches, and fans in coves. Clingman and Craggey soils formed in residuum and are in similar landscape positions with Burton soils. Longhope soils occur in broad drainageways or fens (locally referred to as \"bogs\")."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is in State or Federal ownership and is used for watershed protection, recreation, and wildlife habitat. In areas higher than about 5400 feet, red spruce and fraser fir are the dominant trees. At the lower elevations, northern red oak, chestnut oak, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and yellow buckeye are common trees. In many areas, the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept\" phase is recognized.  Common understory plants are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, silverbell, pin cherry, rhododendron, flame azalea, blueberry, hay-scented fern, woodfern, New York fern, blue grass, and sedges.  Acreage covered by heath balds is vegetated with rhododendron, mountain laurel, blueberry, flame azalea, hawthorn, and mountain ash. A small acreage is used for native pasture."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series was formerly classified as an acid Brown Forest soil. Burton series was initially placed in a mesic family. Soil temperature data has been collected in North Carolina in several counties and supports the frigid family.\nThe 1/97 revision placed Burton soils in a fine-loamy particle-size class. This series was formerly placed in a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Laboratory PSA (pipette method) and corresponding field texture estimates (feel method) indicate control section clay contents of generally 12 to 24 percent, with most pedons marginally coarse-loamy. Fine-loamy particle-size class placement is based on the presence of amorphous (non-crystalline) clay-size material associated with the relatively high organic matter content found in these soils. Although field estimates, laboratory measurements, and calculated values may vary, clay content in the particle-size control section is generally less than 25 percent. Although Burton soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\nThe 3/03 revision reflects the movement of the typical pedon from Transylvania County, NC to Buncombe County, NC.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available from the NSSC Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for this pedon: S91NC-021-008.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 17 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone between 17 and 26 inches (Bw horizon)\nParalithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 26 inches (upper boundary of Cr horizon).\nLithic contact - the occurrence of hard bedrock at a depth of 29 inches (R horizon)\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons: S88NC-199-017, S91NC-021-007, and S91NC-021-008.\nMLRA: 130B SIR(S): NC0093, NC0114 (STONY)\nRevised: 10/92-HJB,DLN,AG; 1/97-DHK, 12/97-DHK, 3/03-MHS, MKC\n02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
