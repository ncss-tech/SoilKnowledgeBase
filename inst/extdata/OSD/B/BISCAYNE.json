  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil thickness and depth to limestone ranges from 1 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout.  This soil ranges from nonsaline to moderately saline throughout.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or less.  Where the matrix value is 3.5 or less, thickness of the A horizon is less than 7 inches, or less than 4 inches if the A horizon lies directly on bedrock.  Redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray range from none to common.  Calcium carbonate equivalencies range from 70 to nearly 100 percent.  Content of limestone pebbles range from 0 to 35 percent, by volume.  Content of limestone fragments, 2.0 mm to 7.5 cm in diameter, in rock plowed or mechanically scarified areas, predominantly is 15 to 25 percent by volume, but ranges up to 35 percent. Whole snail shells and shell fragments from sand-sized to 3.0 cm range from none to common.   Texture is marl with a texture of silt loam, silt, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or less.  Streaks and pockets of organic carbon accumulation range from none to common.  Discontinuous lenses and pockets of muck occur in some pedons.  In some pedons, a thin discontinuous layer of noncalcareous silt loam, mucky silt loam or silty clay loam with values of 2 or 3 and chroma of 3 or less occurs within or below the Cg horizon.  Calcium carbonate equivalencies range from 80 to nearly 100 percent.  Whole snail shells and shell fragments from sand-sized up to 3.0 cm range from none to common.  Texture is marl with a texture of silt loam or silt.\nThe 2R horizon is oolitic limestone with a smooth to irregular surface.  Solution holes several inches to several feet in width, and up to 3 feet in depth, range from none to common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Biscayne soils are in fresh water and tidal marshes and sloughs as well as in broad low coastal flats and elongated sloughs in Southern Peninsular Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in recent, calcareous deposits of dominantly silt sized sediments that precipitated from marine or fresh water.  They are underlain by oolitic limestone, of Pleistocene Age.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 65 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Chekika, Dania, Hallandale, Krome, Lauderhill, Pennsuco, Perrine, and Tamiami series.  Chekika and Krome soils are on higher positions and are loamy-skeletal.  In addition, Chekika soils are somewhat poorly drained and Krome soils are moderately well drained and have less than 50 percent silt in their fine earth fractions.  The very poorly drained Dania, Lauderhill and Tamiami soils are on similar positions.  In addition, Dania soils have shallow organic layers over limestone while Lauderhill and Tamiami soils have moderately deep organic layers over limestone.  Hallandale soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are composed of shallow sand deposits over limestone.  The poorly drained Perrine soils are on similar positions and are moderately deep to soft limestone.  Pennsuco soils are on similar positions and are deep to limestone."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas of this soil have been drained and are used for growing vegetable and grain crops, and ornamental trees and shrubs.  The native vegetation consists of sawgrass, cattail, primrose willow, sabal palm, buttonbush, bonesets, gulf muhly, broomsedge, and a variety of other water tolerant sedges and grasses.  Calcium carbonate crusted paraphyton covers the soil surface in many fresh water areas.  Exotic tree species, including Brazilian Pepper, Australian Pine, and melaleuca have become established in many disturbed areas."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon).\nCarbonatic feature:  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from 70 percent to almost 100 percent.\nShallow depth:  Oolitic limestone at 15 inches (2R horizon).\nThis soil was mapped as Perrine marl, shallow phase and Perrine marl, very shallow phase in the 1947 soil survey of Dade County.  Previously correlated Perrine Variant soils (FL 8002) will be included in this series.\nShould current proposals to amend soil taxonomy be adopted, these soils would classify as \"marly hyperthermic Lithic Limnaquents\".\nIn natural areas, the water table is at or above the surface for 4 to 6 months during most years.  In areas where water control measures have been applied, the water table is within 10 inches of the surface for 4 to 6 months during most years, and remains between depths of 10 and 36 inches the rest of the year.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization and Engineering test data is available for this pedon.  S85FL-025-001 (1-3)676 and S85FL-025-002 (1-3)677 samples by NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
