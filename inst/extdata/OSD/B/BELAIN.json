  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Belain series consists of moderately deep, well drained loamy soils that formed in residuum weathered from igneous rock and alluvium or colluvium over bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, bedrock-floored plains, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
