  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated depth ranges in the following paragraph are from the mineral surface to the specified depth.) Solum thickness and depth of the sandy lacustrine material ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. The solum is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 3 inches thick. The A and E horizon are extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bhsm has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bsm horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Reaction of the Bhsm and Bsm horizons is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Pedons may have either or both a Bhsm or Bsm, but one is always present.\nThe BC horizon has colors similar to those of the 2C horizon and is sand or fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Textures include fine sand, very fine sand and silt loam, with few strata of loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and silt. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

The  seasonal high water table is perched at the contact with the loamy 2C material and ranges from 2 to 3.5 feet below the surface from November to April. Surface runoff is negligible to very low. Permeability is rapid in the solum except for the ortstein horizon that is moderate or moderately rapid, and is moderately slow in the loamy material."
