  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic mat ranges from 1 to 7 inches.  Depth to the permafrost ranges from 10 to 40 inches below the soil surface two months after the summer solstice.  Texture of the control section is dominantly silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The weighted average particle size has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction throughout the profile increases with depth, ranging from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5YR to 2.5Y; value moist of 2 to 4; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam often with a mucky modifier.\nThe C or Cg horizon (where present) has hue of N, 5GY,5Y, or 2.5Y; value moist from 2 to 5; and chroma moist from 0 to 5.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Tanana and Tetlin series.  Tanana soils have thin stratas of fine sandy loam and fine sand in the control section. Tetlin soils are on bedrock cored hills and are assumed to have residuum or bedrock within the permafrost in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bradway soils formed in a thin organic mat over micaceous alluvial sediments.  Bradway soils are on nearly level alluvial plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Chena, Goldstream, Jarvis, and Salchaket soils.  Chena soils are excessively drained and lack permafrost.  Goldstream soils have thick organic mats.  Jarvis and Salchaket soils are well drained, stratified, and lack permafrost.  All of these soils are on similar landforms."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is slow to ponded.  Permeability is moderate above the permafrost.  Free water is perched above the permafrost.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic layer is destroyed by fire or mechanical clearing. Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level with subsequent lowering of the water table."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile include: Permafrost at 36 inches with saturated conditions above; weighted average particle-size of coarse-loamy from 10 to 36 inches; pH greater than 5.5 (1:1,H20) from 0 to 36 inches.\nAny impact to the organic mat such as burning or clearing will alter the thermal regime of the soil. In such cases the permafrost and the water table may drop below the series control section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
