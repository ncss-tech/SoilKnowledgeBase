    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 55 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer. Thickness of the soil above the very gravelly and very cobbly layers ranges from 15 to\n30 inches. Rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section average 35 to 60 percent by volume. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 20 inches. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 3 to 25 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 3 to 25 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BA horizon has value of 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam or silt loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 30 percent gravel. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Briedwell soils are on old alluvial terraces at elevations of 200 to 650 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed of silty alluvium or loess over very cobbly and gravelly moderately fine textured alluvium. Rock fragments are of igneous and sedimentary origin. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F; average July temperature is 67 degrees F; and the average annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches."
