  "OVERVIEW": "The Bartonflat series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on river and fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Permeability is rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
