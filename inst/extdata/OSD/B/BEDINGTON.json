  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 5 to 15 feet. It is generally fractured to the extent that it can be excavated with a backhoe or trencher.  Rock fragments of sedimentary shale, siltstone, and sandstone that are angular or subangular channers range in the individual horizons of the solum from 5 to 40 percent in the upper part and from 20 to 80 percent in the lower part. Rock fragments in the C horizon range from 50 to 90 percent.  Rock fragments increase with depth in the soil and average less than 35 percent by volume in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  The reaction in unlimed soils ranges from very strongly acid through strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and is very strongly acid and strongly acid in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.  Areas that have been heavily limed may be neutral to slightly acid throughout the soil. Limited data indicates that illite, kaolinite, and vermiculite are the dominant clay minerals.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons may have a thin BA or BE horizon. The BA,BE and Bt horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 5 through 8.  Some subhorizon of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR.  Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam."

Albemarle soils have rock fragments that are dominantly quartz, quartzite, and arkosic sandstone.  Allegheny, Clymer, Edgemont, Frankstown, Rayne and Shelocta soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout the B horizon.  Allenwood soils formed in glacial till and contain rock fragments of subrounded gravel and have lower Bt horizons that are firm or very firm.  Aura, Chetwynd, Collington, and Freehold soils have more than 45 percent sand and less than 28 percent silt in the B horizon.  Birdsboro soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the solum and the rock fragments are rounded gravel.  Bucks, Butano, Chilmark, Elsinboro, Glenelg, Leck Kill, Quakertown, and Syenite soils have sola that are less than 40 inches.  Chester and Cowee  soils contain mica and have rock fragments of granite, schist or gneiss.  Eubank soils have rock fragments of quartz and granodiorite.  Gilpin soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Meadowville soils have sandy clay loam or sandy clay 2Bt horizons.  Matapeake soils have a silt mantle over unconsolidated sandy coastal plain materials.  Murrill soils do not have increasing rock fragment content with depth and have rock fragments of subrounded sandstone or quartzite.  Nixon soils have rock fragments that are dominantly quartzite cobbles.  Shouns soils do not have as high a content of rock fragments in the lower B or C horizons and have colors of 5YR or redder in the entire Bt horizon. Thurmont soils have angular rock fragments dominated by quartz, quartzite, granite or gneiss.  Ungers soils have sola  with chromas of 4 or less and with hue dominantly\n5YR hue or redder and the fine-earth fraction contains less than 40 percent silt.  Whiteford soils have rock fragments of slate.\nBerks, Duffield, Hartleton, Muskingum, Wellston and Westmoreland series are similar soils in related families.  Berks and Hartleton soils have loamy-skeletal particle size control sections.  Duffield, Wellston and Westmoreland soils have more than 35 percent base saturation.  Muskingum soils do not have an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bedington soils are nearly level to  steep and are on convex dissected uplands and sideslopes of ridges and hills. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  They formed in residuum weathered from acid shale or interbedded shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 48 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 57 degrees F.; mean growing season ranges from 150 to 190 days."

Blairton and Comley soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained.  Brinkerton and Markes soils are poorly drained.  Dekalb, Hazleton and Weikert soils do not have argillic horizons.  Ernest soils are moderately well drained.  Shouns, Gilpin, Hartleton and Berks are difficult to differentiate from Bedington soils, because of common limits."
