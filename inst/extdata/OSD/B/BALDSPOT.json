  "OVERVIEW": "The Baldspot series consists of very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rock. The Baldspot soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.",
