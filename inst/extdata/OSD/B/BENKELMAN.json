  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Benkelman series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous, loamy alluvial sediments on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F at the type location.",
