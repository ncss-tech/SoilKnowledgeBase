  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout the control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 40 inches or more.  The sola contains 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles and stones by volume. The solum is estimated to have a volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue dominantly of 5YR but ranges from 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is heavy loam or light clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  This horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  The B and 2C horizons have 0 to 20 percent cobbles and stone and 0 to 15 percent gravel."

The soils formed from volcanic ash mixed with loess and stony moderately fine textured colluvium weathered from andesite or basalt.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 30 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free  period 50 to 100 days."
