  "REVDATE": "05/2013",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blossberg series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on flood plains, depressions, drainageways, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium 20 to 40 inches deep over sand and gravel.  Slope is 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
