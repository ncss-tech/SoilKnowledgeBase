  "OVERVIEW": "The Bouldrock series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountainous areas.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from quartz diorite.  Slope is 12 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
