Organic carbon ranges from  0.3 to 0.60 in the upper 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or very bouldery loam.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 30 percent stones and 0 to 30 percent boulders.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand, with 0 to 20 percent gravel."
