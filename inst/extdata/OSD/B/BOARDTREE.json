    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cubic centimeter and contain 60 to 70 percent glass and glass aggregate in the ash overlay. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is greater than 60 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the 3 months following the summer solstice. Thickness of the ashy materials and depth to contrasting clayey materials range from 20 to 40 inches. Bedrock commonly is deeper than 60 inches. Rock fragments greater than 2mm in size range from 0 to 30 percent within the control section. Cobbles and stones commonly are absent but may range to 5 percent in some pedons. The soil is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is gravelly loam, loam, or silt loam with 10 to 20 percent clay. It has 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles or stones. Organic matter is 2 to 4 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is gravelly loam, loam, or silt loam with 10 to 20 percent clay. It has 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles or stones.\nThe C horizon has characteristics similar to the Bw horizon and is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."
