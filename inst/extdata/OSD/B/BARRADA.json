  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barrada series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in saline, clayey over loamy alluvial and storm washover sediments of Holocene age.  These nearly level soils are on wind tidal flats and in enclosed depressions.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22.8 degrees C (73 degrees F).",
