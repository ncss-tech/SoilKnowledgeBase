  "OVERVIEW": "The Bittercreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in stratified mixed alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface horizons.  Bittercreek soils are on flood plains in narrow canyons.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soil has aquic conditions present between depths of 6 to 18 inches as indicated by redoximorphic concentrations.  The soil profile is saturated in all layers below 6 inches down to a depth of 80 inches from March to July.  The particle size control section has less than 18 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent sand of which less than 50 percent is fine sand or coarser in the upper portion and less than 15 percent clay and more than 70 percent sand in the lower portion.  Rock fragments in the lower particle-size control section range from 0 to 70 percent.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the strongly contrasting substratum is 15 to 30 inches.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry.  It has 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 0.5 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  It is ashy silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has texture of ashy loam, ashy very fine sandy loam, or ashy silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has 5 to 20 percent glass and 0.5 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe 2C horizon is multicolored.  It has texture of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand with 3 to 10 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 40 percent gravel."

Tamarackcanyon soils are clayey-skeletal and 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Threebuck soils are medial over clayey-skeletal and 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Tolo soils are on fan terraces just above the flood plains, are ashy over loamy, and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Mippon soils are also on flood plains but are upstream from Bittercreek soils.  Mippon soils are sandy-skeletal and moderately well drained.  Rondowa (T) soils are on moraines, loamy-skeletal, and well drained."
