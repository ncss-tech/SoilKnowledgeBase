    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.   Bedrock is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments are mainly gravel and cobble size angular sandstone, with some limestone and quartzite rock fragments.  Secondary carbonate is at a depth of 17 to 36 inches. Coarse fragments generally increase in volume with depth ranging from 15 to 35 percent in the A horizon, 25 to 60 percent in the Bt horizon and 35 to 80 percent in the Bk horizon.  Clay content of the particle size control section is 25 to 35 percent.  A and B horizons are noncalcareous above the calcic horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 44 to 47 degrees F, and the average summer temperature is 68 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction is neutral or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Rock fragment content is 25 to 60 percent.   Texture is very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, gravelly clay loam or cobbly clay loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 80 percent.  Texture is extremely gravelly loam, very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam.  Clay content is 15 to 30 percent.  Carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived mostly from sandstone but with some interbedded limestone and quartzite rocks. The climate is dry subhumid, with average annual precipitation of 12 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F, and the freeze-free period is 70 to 115 days.  Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 9,000 feet."
