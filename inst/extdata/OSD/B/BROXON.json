  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Broxon soils are on level to gently sloping terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 4,500 feet.  The soils formed in loess and silty alluvium overlying alluvial sand, gravel, cobbles, and stones of mixed mineralogy and associated with the ancient Bonneville Flood.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 110 to 130 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bahem, Broncho, McDole, and Pocatello soils.  The Bahem soils are 40 inches or more to sand, gravel, cobbles, and stones.  The Broncho soils have sandy-skeletal control sections.  The McDole and Pocatello soils lack strongly contrasting textures.  The Bahem soils are on the same landscape position as the Broxon soils.  The Broncho soils are on terrace breaks and slightly convex areas.  McDole soils are on slightly lower landscape positions on floodplains and low terraces.  Pocatello soils are on loess covered fan terraces and foothills."
