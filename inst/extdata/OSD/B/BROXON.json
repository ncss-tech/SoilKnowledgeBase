  "OVERVIEW": "The Broxon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium overlying alluvial sand, gravel, cobbles, and stones.  These soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid below.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soils formed in loess and silty alluvium overlying alluvial sand, gravel, cobbles, and stones of mixed mineralogy and associated with the ancient Bonneville Flood.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 110 to 130 days."

The Broncho soils have sandy-skeletal control sections.  The McDole and Pocatello soils lack strongly contrasting textures.  The Bahem soils are on the same landscape position as the Broxon soils.  The Broncho soils are on terrace breaks and slightly convex areas.  McDole soils are on slightly lower landscape positions on floodplains and low terraces.  Pocatello soils are on loess covered fan terraces and foothills."
