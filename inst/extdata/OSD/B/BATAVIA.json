Carroll, Myrtle, Nasset, Newhouse, Shelbyville, Watkins, Waubeek, and Yutan soils. Bowes soils have more than 5 percent coarse materials and more than 90 percent sand in the lower 1/4 of the control section. Churchtown, Downs, Greenbush, Knox, Mannon, Mt. Carroll, and Yutan soils contain less than 10 percent sand in the lower 1/4 of the control section and formed in loess. Deroin soils have hue redder than 10YR in the Bt horizon.  Ella, Festina, and Watkins soils contain less sand in the lower part of the sola and formed in alluvial materials. Frankville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Gladek soils formed in lacustrine sediments.  Harvard, Mellott, and Waubeek soils have more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Hersey and Myrtle soils contain less silt in the lower part of the B and C horizon. Luana soils have thinner sola. Massbach, Nasset, and Shelbyville soils average more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the B horizon and have the lower part of the B horizon formed in residuum from limestone or shale. Newhouse soils contain strata and more sand above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and formed in a thinner mantle of loess."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Batavia soils are on loess covered sandy loam till plains, glacial outwash plains, or stream terraces. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. These soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and in loamy stratified outwash or in sandy loam till. Summers are hot and winters are cold. The mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 12.2 degrees C (44 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches), and frost free period ranges from 140 to 180 days."

Virgil soils are generally less sloping and are somewhat poorly drained. Drummer soils are poorly drained soils on nearly level parts and in depressions of till plains and outwash plains and have a mollic epipedon."
