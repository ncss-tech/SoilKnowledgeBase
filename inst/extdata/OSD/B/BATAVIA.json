  "OVERVIEW": "The Batavia series consists of very deep, well drained soils on till plains, glacial outwash plains, and stream terraces. These formed in loess or other silty material and in loamy stratified outwash or sandy loam till. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
