  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Fries series. Fries soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Series in similar families include the Bryce, Fonda, Lorain, Milford, Montgomery, and Toledo series. Bryce, Milford, and Montgomery soils have mixed mineralogy. Fonda, Lorain, and Toledo soils lack mollic epipedons and, in addition, Lorain soils have argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bono soils are on lake plains, in depressions on moraines and till plains, and in local areas between beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in calcareous, fine-textured lacustrine sediments with some stratification. Climate is humid and continental. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blount, Colwood, Fulton, Glynwood, Hoytville, Lenawee, Lucas, Pewamo, and Toledo soils. Blount, Glynwood, and Pewamo soils formed in till and have a higher content of rock fragments. Colwood soils are on similar landscapes and have lower clay content. Fulton, Lucas, and Toledo soils formed in the same materials as Bono soils. Fulton soils are on low ridges or gently sloping side slopes along drainageways. The moderately well drained Lucas soils typically are on gentle to steep side slopes. Hoytville, Lenawee, and Toledo soils are in similar landscape positions as Bono soils and lack mollic epipedons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Bono soils are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, and small grains. Undrained areas are in permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is marsh grasses and deciduous swamp forest, principally of elm, silver maple, sycamore, cottonwood, and swamp white oak."
