This  soils is usually moist but is dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of ten.  The series control section contains less than l5 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR; value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma of 3 or 4  moist or dry.   Reaction is very strongly acid through slightly acid.  Some pedons have E horizons.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR through 5Y; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry; and chroma of 2 through 4  moist and dry.  It is sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid."

All of these  soils are dry in the moisture control section more than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  In addition, Keystone soils are dry for 75 to 90 days.  Greenwater soils have 5 to 25 percent of the  whole soil volcanic ash and pumice.  Pilchuck soils lack a B horizon and have a chroma of 2 or less throughout the control section."

Elevation is from 200 to l,200 feet.  These soils formed in sandy glacial outwash.  They occur in a climate having a mean annual precipitation of 60 to 85  inches.  Average January temperature is about 37 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The  frost-free season is about l60 to 220 days."
