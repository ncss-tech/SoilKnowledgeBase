  "OVERVIEW": "The Birdsview series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in glacial outwash.   Birdsview soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 5l degrees F.",

The series control section contains less than l5 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR; value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma of 3 or 4  moist or dry.   Reaction is very strongly acid through slightly acid.  Some pedons have E horizons.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR through 5Y; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry; and chroma of 2 through 4  moist and dry.  It is sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid."
