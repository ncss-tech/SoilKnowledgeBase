These soils formed in colluvium derived from limestone and thin strata of interbedded calcareous shale. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,200 to 3,340 meters. The climate is moist, subhumid with cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
