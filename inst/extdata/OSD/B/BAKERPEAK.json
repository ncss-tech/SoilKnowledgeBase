  "OVERVIEW": "The Bakerpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone and thin strata of interbedded calcareous shale. Bakerpeak soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
