  "OVERVIEW": "The Barnmot series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments. Barnmot soils are on terraces, hills, and fan remnants. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11.5 degrees C.",
