Deaver soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts of soft shale.  Ragtown soils are stratified, moderately well drained, and average 25 to 35 percent clay in the upper part of the control section. Stutzman soils have more than 40 percent silt in the control section and a mean annual soil temperature less than 12 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barnmot soils are on terraces, hills, and fan remnants.  They formed in colluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 1,950 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Celeton soils are loamy, very shallow and shallow to paralithic contacts, and formed in residuum derived from diatomite. Kleinbush soils have natric horizons.  Rednik soils are loamy-skeletal and have argillic horizons.  Ricert soils are fine-loamy and have natric horizons."
