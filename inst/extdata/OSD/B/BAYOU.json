    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the upper part and from extremely acid to moderately acid in the lower part except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 2. Few to common fine or medium mottles in shades of gray, brown, or yellow are present in this horizon in most pedons. Texture is sandy loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown and yellow range from none to common. Texture is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown and yellow range from none to common. Texture is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, yellow and red range from few to many. Some pedons have no dominant color and are multicolored in shades of gray, brown, yellow and red. Some pedons may have small pockets of coarser-textured material in the lower horizons. Some pedons also have a few nodules of plinthite in the lower horizons. Texture is sandy loam or loam in the upper part and ranges to sandy clay loam or clay loam in the lower part."

Atmore and Escambia soils have 5 percent or more plinthite within 60 inches of the surface. In addition, Escambia soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on higher positions. Grady soils are in depressions and have clayey control sections. The moderately well drained Harleston soils are on higher positions. The very poorly drained Johnston soils are on slightly lower drainageways and have an umbric epipedon."

Native over story vegetation consists mainly of longleaf pine with an understory of southern bayberry, inkberry, swamp cyrilla, black gum, water oak, bluestems, goldenrod, yellow eyed grass, panicum, blazing star, and pitcher plants."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 inches (A1, A2 and Eg horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 18 to 66 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 and Btg4 horizons).\nBayou soils were formerly classified in the Low-Humic Gley great soil group. They were included in the Smithton series. Bayou soils have site indices for longleaf, loblolly, and slash pine that are significantly lower than for Smithton soils. The average site index for longleaf pine (based on 10 sites with 5 trees per site) was 47 feet, for slash pine (based on 2 sites with 5 trees per site) was 62 feet and for loblolly (based on 1 site with 5 trees) was 65 feet.\nBayou soils are saturated during the wet season, primarily in winter and early spring months and have seasonal water tables that range from 0 to 1.0 foot of the surface.\nBayou soils are in MLRA 152A.\nADDITIONAL DATA: No data is available at the time of this update.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
