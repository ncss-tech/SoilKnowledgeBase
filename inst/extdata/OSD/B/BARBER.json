    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The series control section contains up to 3 percent rock fragments.  The depth to carbonates is greater than 80 inches.   The particle-size control section has less than 25 percent medium sand or coarser.\nSome pedons have an Oe or Oa horizon as much as 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of  10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. It typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations and depletions. Concentrations are weakly to moderately cemented in some pedons.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of  10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand but subhorizons of loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam occur in some pedons. It typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations and depletions. Concentrations are weakly to moderately cemented in some pedons.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barber soils are on convex or linear surfaces of glacial lake plains and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  They formed in eolian and/or glaciolacustrine materials.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches.  The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days.  Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1425 feet."

The poorly drained Anchorlake, very poorly drained Kapla and moderately well drained Westoo soils form a hydrosequence with the Barber soils.  Somewhat poorly drained Vasso and poorly drained Wabuse soils have loamy texture within the particle-size control section. Cathro and Rifle soils occur in broad flats and in depressions and formed in organic materials."
