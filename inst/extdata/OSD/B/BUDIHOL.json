  "OVERVIEW": "The Budihol series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills and sideslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
