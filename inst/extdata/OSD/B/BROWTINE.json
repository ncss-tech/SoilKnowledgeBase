  "OVERVIEW": "The Browtine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to steep fan terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to continuous carbonate accumulation ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The control section averages 15 to 75 percent pebbles and 0 to 40 percent cobbles, 35 to 75 percent total.  Control section (noncarbonate) clay ranges from 8 to 15 percent, and fine sand and coarser from 40 to 70 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Matrix texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam with very or extremely cobbly or very or extremely gravelly modifiers.  Subhorizons with non-skeletal modifiers or textures of loamy sand, sandy clay loam, and clay loam are allowed, the finer textures are thought to be the result of carbonate clay.  Calcium carbonate equivalent, when averaged, ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 6.  Textures are the same as the Bk horizons.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Bruman soils have sandy-skeletal substrata within 40 inches.  Twocabin soils have argillic horizons."
