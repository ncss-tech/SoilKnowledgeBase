  "OVERVIEW": "The Benstot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone.  Benstot soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bw and C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, with chroma of 1 to 3. Redox concentrations occur below 30 inches.  The Bw horizon when present doesn't meet the definition of a cambic horizon."
