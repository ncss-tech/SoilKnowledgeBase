  "OVERVIEW": "The Brogdon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy marine sediments.  These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper subsoil and slow permeability in the lower subsoil.  These soils have sandy A and E horizons over loamy Bt horizons which are underlain by another sequum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  The soil is bisequal.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizons and very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The particle-size control section has an average clay content of 8 to 18 percent, less than 20 percent silt, and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe E and Bt horizon is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches below the surface.   It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  This horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand with remnants of sandy loam Bt material and pockets and streaks of clean sand.  In some pedons, this horizon is an E' horizon and does not have sandy loam Bt material.\nThe B't and Btv horizons are about 30 to 60 inches below the surface.  They have matrix with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 or it is mottled with these colors.  Mottles in shades of red or gray are in some pedons.  The B't and Btv horizons commonly are sandy clay loam, and less commonly sandy loam, sandy clay, or clay loam."
