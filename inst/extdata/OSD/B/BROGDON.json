  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  The soil is bisequal.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizons and very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The particle-size control section has an average clay content of 8 to 18 percent, less than 20 percent silt, and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe E and Bt horizon is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches below the surface.   It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  This horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand with remnants of sandy loam Bt material and pockets and streaks of clean sand.  In some pedons, this horizon is an E' horizon and does not have sandy loam Bt material.\nThe B't and Btv horizons are about 30 to 60 inches below the surface.  They have matrix with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 or it is mottled with these colors.  Mottles in shades of red or gray are in some pedons.  The B't and Btv horizons commonly are sandy clay loam, and less commonly sandy loam, sandy clay, or clay loam."

The Benndale, Butters, Dothan, Eustis, Harleston, Kalmia, Kenansville, McLaurin, Norfolk, Paola, Rumford, and Ruston series are similar soils in related families.  Benndale, Harleston, and McLaurin soils have more than 20 percent silt in the top 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Butters soils do not have plinthite.  Eustis soils have a sandy Bt horizon.  Kalmia, Kenansville, and Rumford soils have a solum less than 40 inches thick.  Dothan, Norfolk, and Ruston soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the top 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Paola soils have a sandy epipedon more than 20 inches thick."
