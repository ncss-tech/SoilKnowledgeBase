  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 57 to 59 degrees F and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F after about the 10th of February.  Soil between the depths of about 5 and 15 inches usually is moist in some or all parts from about December 1 until late May and usually is dry all the rest of the time.  Rock fragments usually make up less than 5 percent of the soil except in some pedons there is more than 5 percent rock fragments in and near the surface and near the paralithic contact.\nThe A horizon is brown to dark brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, 4/4) dry and has a moist value of 3.  Organic matter averages 1 to 3 percent in the upper 4 to 5 inches and is less than 1 percent below a depth of 7 to 8 inches.  This horizon is fine sandy loam or loam and is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon is strong brown or yellowish red or it is red in 2.5YR hue.  This horizon is clay loam or sandy clay generally with less than 30 percent clay.  It is slightly or moderately acid."

Bull Trail and Steinbeck soils lack a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Morical soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the B horizon and have a chroma of 4 or less in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bancas soils are on rolling to very steep uplands at elevations of 5,000 feet down to 2,000 feet on north slopes.  They formed in residuum weathered from rock, usually somewhat metamorphosed but including granite, gneiss, quartz diorite, and quartz mica schist.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches.  The average January temperature is 42 degrees F, the average July temperature is 68 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 56 to 58 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 175 to 230 days."

Holland soils have less than 75 percent base saturation and lack a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  La Posta soils have a mollic epipedon and are sandy.  Sheephead soils have a mollic epipedon and have a paralithic contact less than 20 inches below the surface."
