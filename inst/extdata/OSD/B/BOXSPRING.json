  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boxspring soils are on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 945 to 2,380 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to the Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 180 days."
