These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite and schist. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F); mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 15 degrees C (49 to 59 degrees F). The frost free season is about 150 to 250 days."
