  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Berit series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Berit soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Alcan, Armoine, Entero, Ravenell, and Zyzzi soils are moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer and contain less than 60 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  In addition, Ravenell soils have a Bt horizon with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Bouncer soils are influenced by volcanic ash and have less than 25 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Flex soils have less than 50 percent rock fragments.  Ginex soils contain a secondary  carbonate accumulation in the Bt horizon and is slightly to strongly effervescent throughout. Harvan soils have desic materials at 30 to 50 cm. Penelas soils are slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline in the solum, have soft shale fragments, and have less than 35 percent sand.  Sedsked soils have paralithic materials of weathered metasedimentary bedrock in the series control section.  Soar soils have less than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and contain less than 60 percent rock fragments.  Stodick soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 36 to 50 cm and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
