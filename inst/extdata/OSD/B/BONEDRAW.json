  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "AKN-THW-RM",
  "REVDATE": "03/2018",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonedraw series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils formed in gravelly clayey alluvium derived from limestone of the Segovia and Fort Terrett Formations. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur in draws of dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
