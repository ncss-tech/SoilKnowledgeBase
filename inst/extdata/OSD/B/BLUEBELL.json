  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of February 2004 changed the typical pedon and moved the type location from Modoc County, California to Elko County, Nevada.  The original type location in Modoc County, California was reexamined by field soil scientists in 2003.  The Bluebell soils in the Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area soil survey has been determined to be very deep, ashy-skeletal, and is now correlated to the tentative Cowbell series.\nThe revision of March 2014 correlated the Bluebell series mapped in MLRA 25 (Duck Valley Area, ID677) to the Rutherford series. The remaining Bluebell soils are mapped only in MLRA 43B.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 3 to 64cm (A1, A2, AB and Bt horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 48 to 64cm (Bt horizon)\nLithic contact - the zone starting at 64cm (R horizon)\nParticle size control section - the zone from 48 to 64 cm (Bt horizon)\nBluebell soils have a cryic temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
