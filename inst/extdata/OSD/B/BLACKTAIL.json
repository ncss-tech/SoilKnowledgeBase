  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacktail series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources. Blacktail soils are on fan remnants, sideslopes, and pediments. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F (15.6 degrees C).",
