  "OVERVIEW": "The Bargeville series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from quartzite.  These soils are on dip slopes, mountain slopes, and scarp slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 560 mm and annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
