    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is greater than 60 inches (see remarks).  Loess thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to lithic or paralithic contact is greater than 60 inches.\nThe upper part of the series control section (the part formed in loess) averages less than 8 sand percent and gravel content of less than 1 percent.  Individual horizons have properties as follows:\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Pedons with value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick or have dry value of 6 or more.  Texture is silt loam, except some severely eroded pedons are silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon (where present) has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silty clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe lower part of the series control section (the part formed in residuum) has rock fragment content that ranges from 10 to 90 percent, and averages 15 to 40 percent.  Their lithology is dominantly chert.  Clay content ranges from 32 to 42 percent. Properties of individual horizons are as follows:\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Hue of 10YR is only in upper subhorizons.  The fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 70 percent and sand content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have, within a depth of 80 inches a 2Btb horizon.  It has colors as defined for the 2Bt horizon.  The fine earth fraction is silty clay or clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 30 to 90 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess and \"cherty\" residuum.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 to 54 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 39 inches, frost free days range from 180 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 500 to 1020 feet above sea level."

Lacrescent soils formed in colluvium and are on foot slopes below the Baylis soils.  Fayette, Menfro and Winfield soils formed entirely in loess and are on summits and shoulder slopes above the Baylis soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The depth of influence of the modern soil development on the paleosol is difficult to assess.  It is believed to be to depths of greater than 60 inches.  Also the thickness of the residuum is variable in the field, even on the same landform and landform position.  Buried horizons are described at depth in some pedons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon -- the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon -- the zone from 7 to 80 inches (see remarks above; Bt and 2Bt horizons); paleosol feature -- matrix hue of 5YR with chroma of 5 in lowest argillic subhorizon (2Bt5 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
