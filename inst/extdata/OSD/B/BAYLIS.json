  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The depth of influence of the modern soil development on the paleosol is difficult to assess.  It is believed to be to depths of greater than 60 inches.  Also the thickness of the residuum is variable in the field, even on the same landform and landform position.  Buried horizons are described at depth in some pedons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon -- the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon -- the zone from 7 to 80 inches (see remarks above; Bt and 2Bt horizons); paleosol feature -- matrix hue of 5YR with chroma of 5 in lowest argillic subhorizon (2Bt5 horizon)."
