  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Belding series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on till plains and end moraines.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part of the solum,moderately slow in the lower part and slow to very slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
