They developed from colluvium and residuum weathered from interbedded shale and sandstone.  The shale and sandstone are tilted and interbedded with bands of limestone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 210 to 250 days and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."
