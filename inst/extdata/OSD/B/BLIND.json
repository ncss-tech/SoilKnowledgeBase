  "OVERVIEW": "The Blind series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic colluvium and alluvium.  Blind soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 30 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
