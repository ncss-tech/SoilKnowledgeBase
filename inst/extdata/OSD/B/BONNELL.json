  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonnell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in less than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or loamy materials and the underlying till. These soils are on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 6 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bonnell soils are typically on shoulders and back slopes of dissected till plains, considered to be of the Illinoian stage. They formed in less than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or loamy material from valley side alluvium, and the underlying till. Slope ranges from 6 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Frost free period is 150 to 200 days. Elevation is 122 to 259 meters (400 to 850 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Avonburg soils are typically on nearly level summits. The moderately well drained Blocher soils are typically on shoulders and backslopes. The well drained Carmel, Eden and Hickory soils are on backslopes. The Carmel and Eden soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded limestone and shale. The moderately well drained Cincinnati and Nabb soils are typically summits and shoulders, and have less clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon."
