  "OVERVIEW": "The Beach series comprises very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum from hard, very fine grained, metamorphic sandstone.  These sloping to steep soils are on sandstone hills and in valleys.  Slopes range from 1 to about 70 percent.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bofecillos (TX), Holguin (TX+AZ), Sauceda (TX), and Scotal (TX) series.  Bofecillos soils formed over basalt, have hues of 7.5YR and 10YR, and are neutral to slightly alkaline.  Holguin soils formed over conglomerate, have 1 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and a slightly warmer soil temperature.  Sauceda and Scotal soils contain more than 2 percent organic carbon and more than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beach soils are in valleys and on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loamy earth, containing many coarse fragments.  The underlying metamorphic rocks that the Beach soils formed in are hard, very fine grained sandstone and siltstone of Precambrian Age.  The climate is arid.  Average annual rainfall is 12 to 16 inches, with most coming in summer and early fall.  Mean annual temperature is from 62 to 67 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  The frost-free period is 210 to 250 days."

Chilicotal, Chispa, Kinco, and Tenneco soils are very deep and occur on lower positions.  Culberspeth soils have a petrocalcic and occur on lower positions.  Bissett soils are shallow to limestone and occur on similar positions."
