  "OVERVIEW": "The Bentonsport series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy colluvium, loamy-skeletal colluvial sediments from limestone and sandstone and the underlying residuum weathered from shale.  These soils are on very steep side slopes on high structural benches, remnants of interfluves, and uplands.  Slope ranges from 25 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
