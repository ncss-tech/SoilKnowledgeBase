The Bland, Bratton, Caneyville, Chrome, Derinda, Donahue, Eden, Edenton, Faywood, Fredonia, Milton, Shrouts, and Wynn soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  The Beasley, Briggsville, Lowell, Miamian and Ozaukee soils have sola less than 40 inches.  Bledsoe soils lack gray mottles in the Bt horizon and have a water table deeper than 6 feet.  Bonnell soils are formed in loess and underlying glacial till.  Brookside soils lack gray mottles in the Bt horizon and the reaction of the lower part of the B horizons range from neutral to mildly alkaline.  Bucklick, Hagerstown, Heitt, Kewaunee, Upshur, Vandalia, Vincent, and Woodsfield soils have Bt horizons redder than 7.5YR.  Gunlock soils have horizons from 20 to 34 inches that have fragic characteristics.  Lamoille soils are in a cooler and drier climate.  Losantville soils formed in calcareous loam glacial till.  Markland and Medary soils formed in lacustrine sediments.  Newnata soils have bedrock from 40 to 60 inches, and have more than 10 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the sola."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 48 inches."
