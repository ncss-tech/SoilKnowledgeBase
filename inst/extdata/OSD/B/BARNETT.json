    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to layers more than 4 inches thick with n-value of more than 0.7 is 20 to 40 inches.  These soils have aquic soil conditions throughout in most years.  An overwash phase is recognized.  The overwash phase has a fine sandy loam, loam, or silty clay loam surface layer 6 to 20 inches thick.\nThe O horizon has neutral colors with value of 3 or 4 or has colors with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1.  The n-value is more than 0.7. The electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 8 dS/m.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has neutral colors with value of 4 or 5 or has colors with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1.  The n-value is less than 0.7.  Texture is clay loam or clay. Electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 12 dS/m.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has neutral colors with value of 5 or 6 or has colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1.  Few to common redoximorphic features are in shades of brown or gray.  The n-value is less than 0.7.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 4 to 16 dS/m.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Cg horizon has neutral colors with value of 3 to 7 or has colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1.  Few to common redoximorphic features, mainly in masses, are in shades of brown or gray.  The n-value ranges from 0.7 to 1.0 in the upper part and ranges to 1.5 in the lower part in some pedons.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 8 to 16 dS/m.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barnett soils are in nearly level coastal, brackish to saline, marshes.  Gulf storms and abnormally high tides frequently flood most areas.  The soils formed in saline, clayey sediments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 5 feet above sea level.  Frost-free days range from 270 to 300.  The Thornthwaite P-E index is 62 to 82."

Bancker, Creole, Gentilly soils are slightly lower in the landscape.  Harris soils are on the same or slightly lower positions.  Ijam, Neel, and Veston soils are higher in the landscape and have n-values of less than 0.7 throughout.  Veston soils also have a loamy particle-size control section."
