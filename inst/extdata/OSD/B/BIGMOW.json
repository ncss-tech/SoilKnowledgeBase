These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuffs and marine sediments with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 26 inches, mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F, and the mean winter temperature is 27 to 32 degrees F. The frost-free period is 20 to 90 days."
