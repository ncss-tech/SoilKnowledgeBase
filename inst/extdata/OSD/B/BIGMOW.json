  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigmow series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolite and sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes are 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",
