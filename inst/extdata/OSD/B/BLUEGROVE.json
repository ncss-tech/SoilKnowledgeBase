(Top of Cr horizon)\nParalithic material at 86 to 163 cm (34 to 64 in). (Cr horizon)\nThe increase in clay from the A to the Bt horizons is insufficient for an abrupt textural change.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL characterization data from Young County, Texas; S92TX-503-007.\nTaxanomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
