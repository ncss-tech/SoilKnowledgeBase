  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic layers are more than 51 inches thick and are commonly underlain by limnic sediments at depths of less than 10 feet.  The fibric material is primarily derived from Hypnum moss and the hemic material is mostly from herbaceous plants except in a few pedons it is dominately derived from Hypnum moss.  Woody fibers and fragments typically are lacking, but a small amount of these are in the upper tier of some pedons.  The organic materials typically contain from 10 to 50 percent mineral matter, but soils with thin layers with as much as 70 percent mineral matter are not excluded from the series.  The control section is neutral or mildly alkaline in 0.01 M CaCl2.  These soils typically are calcareous in all parts of the control section with a calcium carbonate equivalent of 2 to 40 percent, but soils with thin layers that lack free carbonates are not excluded from the series.  Snail shells make up as much as 10 percent of the volume of some layers.  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 40 to 47 degrees F.  The surface tier consists of either hemic or fibric materials or a combination of the two.  The subsurface tier, and in some pedons, part of the bottom tier commonly contains fibric material.  However, in some pedons the fibric material occupies as little as 13 inches or the subsurface tier.  Hemic material has an aggregate thickness of at least 10 inches in the lower two tiers.  The fibric material has 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Value of chroma, or both, commonly increase as much as one unit upon pressing and rubbing.  Unrubbed content of fiber ranges from 65 to 95 percent, and content after rubbing ranges from 40 to 90 percent.  This material is massive or has platy structure and is nonsticky.  The hemic material has 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Value or chroma, or both, either decrease or increase as much as one unit upon rubbing."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are in bogs within glacial moraines, outwash plains, and lacustrine plains.  These bogs formerly were post-glacial lakes.  These soils formed mostly in about 24 to 40 inches of slightly decomposed organic soil material derived primarily from Hypnum mosses overlying moderately decomposed organic soil material derived primarily from herbaceous plants.  These organic soil materials extend to depths of at least 51 inches.  Limnic sediments commonly are within depths of 10 feet.  The climate is humid continental with warm summers and cold winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 20 to 30 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series would have been classified as a bog soil in the former system.  This placement is tentative because further study might indicate that most of the soils that contain appreciable amounts of Hypnum mosses qualify for Typic Borofibrists rather than Hemic Borofibrists and that two taxa based on this feature may be rather meaningless.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES No. 69-35-1 for results of some laboratory analysis of the typifying pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
