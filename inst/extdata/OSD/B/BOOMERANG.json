  "OVERVIEW": "The Boomerang series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Boomerang soils are on fan aprons and inset fans. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
