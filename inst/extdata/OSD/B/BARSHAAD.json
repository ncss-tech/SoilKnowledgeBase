  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: These soils are moist intermittently during winter and spring, dry during summer and fall; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees c.\nMollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 50 cm, includes the Bt1 horizon.\nDepth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered basalt and similar volcanic rocks.\nReaction: Slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 40 to 60 percent.\nRock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as basalt.\nA horizon\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nClay content: 10 to 25 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 1 or 2 percent.\nOther features:  There is an abrupt boundary at the base of this horizon.\nBt1 and Bt2 horizons\nValue: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist. Values of 6 dry, 4 moist, and chroma of 4 occur only in the Bt2 horizon.\nOrganic matter content: 0.5 to 2 percent.\nOther features: Some pedons are calcareous just above the bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barshaad soils are on plateaus, rock pediments, and ridges.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in residuum derived mainly from basalt and similar volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,535 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Frodo soils are clayey and shallow to thin duripans over lithic contacts.  Tristan soils are loamy-skeletal and deep to lithic contacts."
