  "OVERVIEW": "The Barshaad series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt.  Barshaad soils are on plateaus, rock pediments, and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered basalt and similar volcanic rocks.\nReaction: Slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 40 to 60 percent.\nRock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as basalt.\nA horizon\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nClay content: 10 to 25 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 1 or 2 percent.\nOther features:  There is an abrupt boundary at the base of this horizon.\nBt1 and Bt2 horizons\nValue: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.

These soils formed in residuum derived mainly from basalt and similar volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,535 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
