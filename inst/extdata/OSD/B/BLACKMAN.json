  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 58 to 62 degrees F.  These soils have cambic horizons that may be noncalcareous in some part.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 7 to 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in most subhorizons of the particle- size control section.  There is no subhorizon as much as 3 inches thick above a depth of 20 inches that has as much as 15 percent.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of genetically concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 14 to 50 inches.  Mollic colors range from 5 to 10 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section is usually clay or heavy clay loam, but on a weighted average basis clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent, silt from 5 to 45 percent, and sand from 15 to 55 percent with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in most subhorizons of the particle-size control section and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  A majority of subhorizons above a depth of 50 inches have a hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Mottling ranges from no mottles to a few faint mottles with the chroma of both matrix and mottles exceeding 2.  These soils are dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section more than one-half the time the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from 4 to 14 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blackman soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, and old flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale with some influence from glacial materials.  Elevation ranges from 7,200 to 8,000 feet.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches. Average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
