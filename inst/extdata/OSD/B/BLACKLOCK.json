  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacklock series consists of poorly drained soils that are shallow to an ortstein pan, and formed in sandy marine sediments.  These soils are in depressions on marine terraces.  They are underlain by a cemented pan at a depth of 12 to 20 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Depth to the ortstein layer and effective rooting depth range from 12 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 54 degrees F.  The solum is medium to extremely acid and acidity commonly decreases with increasing depth. The substratum is slightly acid to strongly acid.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The surface when mixed to a depth of 10 inches has value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand high in organic matter and contains many roots.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 5 to 7 moist and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 10YR or 5YR and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam or fine sandy loam high in organic matter and contains many fibrous roots.  A decomposed root mat is at the base of the Bh horizon in moist pedons.  The Bsm horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, values of 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles have chroma of 0 to 6. It is loamy sand or sand.  Cementation is weak to strong.  The ratio of free iron to carbon ranges from 0.2 to 2.0.  BC horizons when present have the same color range as Bsm horizons but are loamy sand or loamy fine sand and have weak or no cementation.\nThe C horizon is variegated loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand with lenses cemented by iron or aluminum at a depth of 10 or 12 feet or more."

They are usually in depressions or flats between low ridges or hummocks but are also in poorly drained areas of gently sloping old sand dunes. They formed in unconsolidated sandy marine sediments and eolian deposits.  Elevations range from 25 to 650 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.   The climate is humid, temperate and marine with a dry season during the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 80 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 51 to 53 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 200 to 330 days."

Intensive uses are for cranberry bogs, pasture, occasional homesites and recreation such as campgrounds and hunting. The native vegetation is shorepine, Sitka spruce, Port-Orford-cedar, western hemlock, evergreen huckleberry, rhododendron, salal, madrone, swordfern, azalea, spirea, sedges, rushes, and water-tolerant grasses. Gorse has invaded some cleared areas in southern Oregon."

This classification is based on the addition of the Sideric subgroup to Tropaquads."
