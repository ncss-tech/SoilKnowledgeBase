The moisture control section is usually dry but is moist for more than 1/4 the time the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 14 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is stratified and averages sandy loam or fine sandy loam that is gravelly or very gravelly; or is gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2C horizon ranges widely in color. It is sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand and has 40 to 90 percent rock fragments.  (Some thin lenses have less pebbles.)"

Elevations are 600 to 1800 feet.  The climate is semiarid and has hot dry summers and moist, cold winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Average January temperature is 23 to 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.
