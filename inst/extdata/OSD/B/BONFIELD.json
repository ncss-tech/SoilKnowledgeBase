Consolidated bedrock is at depths of 1.5 meters (5 feet) or more. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part of the series control section and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Typically the lower half of the series control section contains carbonates. The 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inch) control section averages over 35 percent cobbles.\nThe Ap, A, or AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bw or Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 with chroma of 2 either in the matrix, on ped surfaces or as iron depletions in the matrix or on ped surfaces. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Bw, 2Bt, or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 with chroma of 2 either in the matrix, on ped surfaces, or as iron depletions in the matrix or on ped surfaces. It is very cobbly or cobbly loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Percent cobbles range from 20 to 60 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.
