  "OVERVIEW": "The Boise series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent in valleys and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
