Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 41 to 76 centimeters (16 to 30 inches) and extends into the B horizon. The depth to carbonates ranges from 51 to 97 centimeters (20 to 38 inches). Some pedons have carbonates at a shallower depth due to mixing by worm activity. A stone line 3 to 8 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) in thickness is at the glacial till contact in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1. It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons. It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4. It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons. It ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. Most pedons have few or common, faint to prominent redoximorphic features. Some pedons contain diagonal wedges up to 8 centimeters (3 inches) in width of sandy material. It is clay loam or loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. Most pedons have common or many, faint to prominent redoximorphic features. Some pedons contain diagonal wedges up to 8 centimeters (3 inches) in width of sandy material. It is clay loam or loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Beotia and Overly soils are varved with thin layers of sand to clay at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Varves range from 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness. The Graceland and Waubay soils have glacial till at a depth greater than 102 centimeters (40 inches). The Waubay soils also have strata in the horizon above the glacial till. Strata ranges in texture from loam to silty clay loam and are 10 mm to 50 mm in thickness."

Surfaces are plane or concave, and slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of loess overlying glacial till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29 inches). Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 330 to 457 millimeters (13 to 18 inches); and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

The somewhat poorly drained Badger soils have  fine textured control sections and are in deeper swales. The poorly drained Hidewood soils are in drainageways. McKranz soils have a calcic horizon within 41 centimeters (16 inches) of the surface and are along the edges of the deeper swales and drainageways. Kranzburg and Vienna soils have a mollic epipedon less than 41 centimeters (16 inches) thick and are on convex to plane slopes above the Brookings soils."
