  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacksnag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from diorite.  Blacksnag soils are on mountain slopes, mesas, and structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
