  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bagval series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from altered tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Bagval soils are on fan remnants and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
