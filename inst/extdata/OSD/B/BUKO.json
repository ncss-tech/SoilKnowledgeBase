  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to loose sand and gravel is 20 to 36 inches. The sad and gravel consists of stratified layers of sands and loamy sands, with gravel content ranging from 20 to 70 percent but averaging 35 to 60 percent. Depth to secondary carbonates is 11 to 17 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is about 49 degrees to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Organic matter is estimated to be 1.5 to 3 percent in the A horizon, and decreases regularly with increasing depth.\nThe B2 horizon has chroma of 3 or 4. It is usually clay loam or silty clay loam but includes loam or silt loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 60 percent silt.\nThe Cca horizon contains 20 to 50 percent nodules and/or durinodes. A part of the Cca horizon at least 6 inches thick, is weakly cemented and contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Elevations are 4,100 to 4,600 feet. The climate is semiarid with dry summers and moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees to 51 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 110 to 140 days."
