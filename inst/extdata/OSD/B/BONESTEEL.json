  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonesteel series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained soils that formed in loess. Bonesteel soils are in closed depressions on upland plains in the Dakota-Nebraska Eroded Tableland, MLRA 66. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 585 millimeters (23 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
