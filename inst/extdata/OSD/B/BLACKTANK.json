  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacktank series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from tephra. Blacktank soils are on alluvial fans, and washes. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
