  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckboard series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lake terraces.  They formed in lacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
