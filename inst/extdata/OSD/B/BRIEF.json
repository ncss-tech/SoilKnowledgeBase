Average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is estimated to be 47 to 52 degrees F.  The solum is 16 to 40 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.   The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments; some thin individual horizons range from 30 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Anders soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Chenoweth soils lack coarse fragments.  Cleverly soils contain secondary carbonates at depths of 25 to 40 inches.  Cushenbury, Duart, Hesslan, Panamint, and Safety soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Knutsen soils have a 2C horizon of sand and gravel in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Newbon soils are loam or silt loam in the particle-size control section.   Patemos soils have buried Bt horizons.  Wato soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 56 degrees F. and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
