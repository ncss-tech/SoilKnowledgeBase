  "OVERVIEW": "The Blanca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sediments derived mostly from mixed, fine grained, acid igneous formations.  Blanca soils are on high mountain saddles and side slopes.  Slopes are 25 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
