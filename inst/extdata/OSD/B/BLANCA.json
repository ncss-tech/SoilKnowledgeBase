The soils formed in sediments derived mostly from mixed, fine grained, acid igneous formations. These soils occur in a moist subhumid continental climate. The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches at the type location with a maximum falling as winter snows and late summer rains.  The average annual temperature is about 32 degrees to 40 degrees F. and the average summer temperature of about 55 degrees F. The Thornthwaite P-E Index is about 50 to 65."
