  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are continuously saturated with sea water.  Soil salinity is high or very high.  The n value of all horizons within the 10 to 40 inch control section are 1 or more.  Pale yellow sulfur compounds are common on surface of peds after air drying for 30 days.  The soil ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.  Organic layers totaling less than 16 inches thick are in some pedons.  After air drying for 30 days the soil is extremely acid.\nThe Ag horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5G, or neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, 5BG, or neutral, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The upper part of the Cg horizon is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or the mucky analogues of these textures.  Some pedons have pockets or thin strata of clay loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand.  The lower part of the Cg horizon below about 40 inches, is variable, ranging from sand to clay."

Barbary, Barrada, Chastain, Gentilly, Ijam, and Wehadkee soils have sulfur content of less than 0.75 and Wehadkee soils have less than 35 percent clay.  Chastain, Ijam, and Wehadkee soils have n value of less than 1."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bohicket soils are on broad level tidal flats bordering the Atlantic Ocean; less than 3 feet above mean sea level and extending 5 to 15 miles inland along some of the larger rivers.  They are flooded by sea water twice daily.  The soil formed in silty and clayey marine sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 52 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 70 degrees F."
