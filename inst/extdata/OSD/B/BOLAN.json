  "BYREV": "Rev. JDH-LDC-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "10/2009",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bolan series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy eolian material or alluvial sediments. These soils are on convex slopes on till plains, moraines, dissected till plains and treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 780 millimeters.",
