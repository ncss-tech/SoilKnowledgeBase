  "OVERVIEW": "The Bienfait series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  Bienfait soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
