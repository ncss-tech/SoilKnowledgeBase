Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,525 meters (4,000 to 5,000 feet). The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with some snow. The mean annual precipitation is 381 to 533 millimeters (15 to 21 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C. (60 to 64 degrees F.) The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Marielouise soils are on alluvial fans. Marielouise and Runningsprings have mollic epipedons. In addition, Runningsprings soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and a mesic soil temperature regime. Marielouise and Skyland soils do not have a paralithic or lithic contact within 100 centimeters (40 inches)."
