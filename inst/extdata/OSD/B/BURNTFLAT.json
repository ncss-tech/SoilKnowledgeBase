  "OVERVIEW": "The Burntflat series consists of shallow, well-drained soils that formed in residuum from granitoid sources. The Burntflat soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 457 millimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C. (62 degrees F.",
