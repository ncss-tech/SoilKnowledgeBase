  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boxville series consist of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loamy and clayey materials of Pleistocene age.  These very gently sloping to sloping soils are on smooth, slightly convex side slopes of forested terraces in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B).  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 47 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F.",
