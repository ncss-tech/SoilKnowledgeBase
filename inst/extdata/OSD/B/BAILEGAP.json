  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Bailegap series are deep and well drained.  They are on rounded hills, side slopes or ridge tops and formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, siltstone and interbedded shale in the Appalachian Ridge and Valley area. Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 2 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
