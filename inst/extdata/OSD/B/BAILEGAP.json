Lonewood soils lack coarse fragments in the solum.  Lily and Marr soils have a solum thickness of less than 40 inches.  Riney soils do not have hard sandstone rock fragments throughout the solum.  Sassafras soils have rock fragments dominated by smooth quartz gravel.  Sunnyside soils do not have flagstones or cobblestones in the solum. Apison, Cahaba, Granville, Hartsells and Linker soils have a thermic temperature regime.  Brevard, Clymer, Meadowville, Shelocta, Tate and Thurmont soils have mixed mineralogy."

Slope gradient range from 2 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, siltstone and interbedded shale.  The average annual temperature ranges from 47 to 56 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches."
