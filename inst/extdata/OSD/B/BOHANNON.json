    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the 4 -month period following summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. The depth to fractured, moderately cemented, partially weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 7 to 18 inches thick. Clay content in the particle-size control section is 18 to 30 percent. Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent in the A horizon and 15 to 50 percent in the Bw horizon averaging less than 35 percent in the control section. There is 0 to 20 percent pararock fragments present also. The soil is moderately acid to very strongly acid. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. Andic soil features occur in the A horizon, but do not extend beyond 14 inches. Properties include 1.0 to 3.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half acid oxalate iron, moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.0 g/cc, phosphate retention of greater than 85 percent, and 15-bar moisture (air-dried) of 12 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones, and 0 to 15 percent paragravel.\nThe AB horizon, when present, is similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones and 0 to 60 percent pararock fragments.\nThe BC or C horizon, when present, has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is loam or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay. It has 5 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones, and 0 to 40 percent pararock fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gobar, Hembre, Kinney, and Preacher series. All of these soils are greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Gobar soils have a medial silt loam surface layer 7 to 14 inches thick, and commonly have more than 20 percent pararock fragments in the solum of volcanic tuff or tuffaceous breccia origin. Hembre soils have hues of 5YR in the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bohannon soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes, and back slopes of mountains in the Coast Range and Cascade Range in Oregon. These metastable to active landforms are typified by uneven, step-like benches caused by sliding and slumping of bedrock, and reflect ongoing side slope erosional processes on the associated landscapes. Slopes of 2 to 90 percent. Elevations are 25 to 3,000 feet. Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Coast Range mountains elevations are 25 to 2,600 feet, and reach heights of 3,000 feet in the most southern portion of the range in southwestern Oregon; where they are mapped in the Oregon Cascade Range elevations are 1,000 to 3,000 feet. The soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum derived from andesite, arkosic sandstone, or other sedimentary rock types. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers tempered by the influence of marine air patterns. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 130 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 240 days."

All of these soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains. Blachly soils are fine-textured and greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Digger, Remote and Umpcoos soils are skeletal. Kilowan soils are fine-textured and 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Slickrock soils are pachic and deep."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used for timber production, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat. The coniferous forest is dominated by Douglas-fir with minor amounts of tanoak and madrone in the more southern part of the Coast Range. The understory is mixed shrubs and herbs with some combination of all of the following plants: vine maple, salal, western swordfern, cascade Oregongrape and minor amounts of other plants."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon - from 1 to 12 inches (A and AB horizons).\nCambic horizon - from 12 to 18 inches (Bw horizon).\nAndic feature - from 1 to 12 inches (A and AB horizon)\nParticle-size control section - from 11 to 41 inches.\nMedial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nClassification revised 8/2001 to Fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Andic Dystrudepts based on changes to the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 8th edition, lab data, and data from associated soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data from Oregon State University in the published soil survey of the Alsea Basin Area, Oregon. Refer to sample No. 61 Oreg. 20-2; and reference sample # S72OR-011-004, NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
