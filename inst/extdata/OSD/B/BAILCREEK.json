  "OVERVIEW": "The Bailcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium from mixed sources. These soils are on old terraces and mountain backslopes and footslopes. Slopes are 4 to 40 percent. Permeability is slow or very slow. The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
