  "OVERVIEW": "The Blue Lake series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy drift on moraines, ice margin complex, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
