  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brenton soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces of Wisconsinan Age. Topography is relatively smooth and uniform, and slope gradient ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Brenton soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F)., mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1084 mm (35 to 43 inches), frost free days range from 155 to 200 days, and the elevation ranges from 150 to 307 m (492 to 1007 feet) above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Darroch, Elburn, La Hogue, and Mundelein soils are on similar landforms.  Brenton soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Proctor soils and the poorly drained Drummer soils.  Proctor soils are on nearby higher elevations and Drummer soils are on lower parts of the landform."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Brenton SDJR project recognized a till substratum phase and a moderately fine substratum phase. These phases will be investigated during MLRA update activities and possibly a new soil series will be established. The OSD site should be sampled and characterized during MLRA update activities.\nA bedrock substratum phase is also recognized which will be included in a separate SDJR project.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches) (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 36 to 114 cm (14 to 45 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons);\nlithologic discontinuity from loess to outwash at a depth of 84 cm (33 inches);\nudic moisture regime.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
