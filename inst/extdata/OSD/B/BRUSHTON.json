  "OVERVIEW": "The Brushton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Brushton soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
