    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Annieville, Dinsmore, Exira, Galva, Keg, Marshall, Monona, Northboro, Ponca, Port Byron, Raddle, Salix, and Truman series.  Annieville soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess over glacial till.  Dinsmore soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and the underlying glacial till.  Exira soils contain gray relict redoximorphic features above 102 cm (40 inches).  Galva soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Keg soils formed in silty alluvium on flood plains and have carbonates above 30 inches.  Marshall soils average 27 to 34 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Monona soils do not have zones within 152 cm (60 inches) that are frequently saturated for periods longer than one month.  Northboro soils average more than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the control section. Ponca soils have carbonates from 36 to 61 cm (14 to 24 inches). Port Byron soils do not have redoximorphic features in the middle part of the control section.  Raddle soils have an irregular decrease in clay and average more than 10 percent sand in the middle and lower parts of the control section.  Salix soils formed in silty alluvium on flood plains and have carbonates within 76 cm (30 inches).  Truman soils have calcium carbonate equivalent range of 5 to 15 percent in the lower part of the series control section."
