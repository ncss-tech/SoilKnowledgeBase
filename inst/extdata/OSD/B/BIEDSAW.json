  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually calcareous at the surface.  About 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent is present throughout the profile.  The particle-size control section is a clay loam or clay, but clay ranges from 35 to 45 percent, silt from 25 to 50 percent, and sand from 15 to 30 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nDue to the variegated nature of the parent material, Ck horizons have hues of 2.5Y through 10R, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  Visible secondary calcium carbonate is inconsistent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Biedsaw soils are on steep mountain hillsides, foot slopes, back slopes, and ridges.  Slope ranges from about 10 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous sediments weathered from variegated shale.  Elevation ranges from 5,100 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
