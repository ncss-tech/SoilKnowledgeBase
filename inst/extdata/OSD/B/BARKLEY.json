    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 47 degrees F.  The soils usually are moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 65 to 90 days within the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to the extremely hard, firm, and brittle layer is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.   The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt and Btq horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent durinodes.\nThe 2Bq horizon is hard to extremely hard, firm or very firm and brittle.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam and averages 5 to 45 percent gravel.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has 10 to 27 percent clay.  Cementation is discontinuous.\nThe 2Bkq or 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is loam or sandy loam and has 20 to 35 percent gravel. It is none effervescent or slightly effervescent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has 5 to 18 percent clay."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barkley soils are on terraces.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,400 feet in Oregon.  In Idaho elevation is 4,900 to 6,200 feet.  The soils formed in very deep sediment weathered from basalt, felsite, and a small amount of ash.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

Booford soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Raynecreek soils lack the discontinuous cementation.  Pixley soils are shallow to a duripan.  Threek soils are clayey-skeletal."
