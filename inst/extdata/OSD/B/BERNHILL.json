  "OVERVIEW": "The Bernhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Bernhill soils are on glaciated foothills and glaciolacustrine influenced ground moraines. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Glenrose soils are very deep, have a mollic epipedon and are on foothills and outwash plains.Green Bluff soils are coarse-loamy and are on outwash plains over basalt plateaus. Spokane soils are coarse-loamy, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are on foothills, mountains and ridgetops."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil include:\nOchric epipedon - from 1 to 5 inches\nArgillic horizon - from 28 to 37 inches\nParticle-size control section  the zone from 28 to 37 inches (2Bt horizon)\nVitrandic feature  the zone from 1 to 14 inches (A and Bw1 horizon)\nThe classification of this series revised as of 5/00 with addition of superactive cation exchange activity class.\nThe classification of this series revised as of 10/01 with addition of isotic mineralogy.\nInvestigation has been initiated to determine the modal concept of this series. It had been recognized in Spokane, Stevens, and Colville Indian Reservation soil surveys and ranges over moderately deep to very deep depth classes and multiple parent materials. The type location has been moved to the Colville Indian Reservation soil survey to reflect the very deep depth and its development in glacial till.  The Bernhill concept has been correlated to the (      ) series which reflects a deep depth to bedrock and origin from residuum and colluvium weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite and Latah Formation.  Further evaluation is still needed in Stevens County to determine the extent of Bernhill soils."
