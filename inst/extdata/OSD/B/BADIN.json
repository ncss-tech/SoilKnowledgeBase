Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in all horizons except where the surface has been limed. Limed soils are typically moderately acid or slightly acid in the A horizon. Rock fragment content is commonly 5 to 35 percent by volume in the A, E, BE, BA, and Bt horizons, and 20 to 60 percent in the BC and C horizons. Some pedons have individual horizons that have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments by volume. Fragments are dominantly channers.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. In uneroded or slightly eroded pedons, it is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. In eroded pedons, the Ap horizon may be silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction and has 35 to 60 percent clay and more than 30 percent silt. Some pedons have mottles in shades or red, yellow, or brown.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or is mottled in shades of these colors. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, or is mottled in shades of these colors. It is silty clay loam or silt loam saprolite, in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, fractured fine-grained metasedimentary rock.\nThe R horizon, where present, is unweathered, fractured fine-grained\nmetasedimentary rock."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Albertville, Bengal, Brockroad, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Cunningham, Cuthbert, Galilee, Kirvin, Luverne, Masada, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Remlap, Sweatman, Tatum, Townley, Urland, Uwharrie, and Vance series in the same family. Albertville soils formed in residuum from shale and have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Bengal soils have a stony surface layer, high shrink-swell potential, and are slowly permeable. Brockroad and Catharpin soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section. Carnasaw soils formed in residuum from shale and have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Cunningham soils formed in residuum from shale and\nhave a depth to soft bedrock of 30 to 56 inches. Cuthbert and Galilee soils formed in residuum from sandstone and shale. Kirvin soils formed in residuum from shale and have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Luverne soils formed from stratified marine sediments. Masada and McQueen soils formed in alluvial sediments and are very deep. Mayodan soils formed in residuum from Triassic Basin sediments and are very deep. Nason and Tatum soils formed in residuum from schist and have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. Remlap soils formed in residuum from interbedded shale and are very deep. Sweatman soils formed in marine sediments consisting of thinly bedded clayey shales and sandy and loamy material and are very deep. Townley soils formed in residuum\nfrom interbedded shale and sandstone. Urland soils formed in coastal plain sediments and stratified sandstone. Uwharrie and Vance soils are very deep. Of these series, only Catharpin, Masada, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Tatum, Uwharrie, and Vance soils occur in the Southern Piedmont MLRA 136."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Badin soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands in the Piedmont. Slope gradients are commonly 4 to 25 percent, but range from 2 to 55 percent slopes. They formed in residuum weathered from fine-grained metasedimentary rocks such as argillites. Mean annual precipitation is 47 inches and mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F. near the type location."

Cid soils are moderately well or somewhat poorly drained and are on toe slopes and around heads of drains. Georgeville and Herndon soils lack Cr horizons within 60 inches of the surface and occur on smoother landscapes. Goldston soils are shallow, lack continuous Bt horizons, and occur on more broken topography. Kirksey and Lignum soils have low chroma mottles in the control section and occur on smoother lower parts of the landscape. Misenheimer soils are shallow, lack a Bt\nhorizon, and occur on smoother lower parts of the landscape. Montonia soils are fine-loamy. Nanford and Tarrus soils have a depth to weathered bedrock (Cr) of 40 to 60 inches. Pageland soils are Alfisols. Secrest soils have a fine-silty particle size control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Nason and Tatum series. However, those soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 6 inches to a depth of 25 inches (BA, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - the presence of weathered, fractured slate at a depth of 25 inches.\nLithic contact - the presence of unweathered, slightly fractured slate at a depth of 40 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soils similar to Badin were characterized as Herndon slaty silt loam (S65NC-84-5(1-5) by Beltsville laboratory.
