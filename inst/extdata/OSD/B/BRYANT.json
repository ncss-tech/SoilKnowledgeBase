    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 11 to 27 inches and typically is less than 20 inches.  The particle-size control section typically contains 26 to 30 percent clay but ranges from 22 to 35 percent.  It contains 2 to 40 percent sand, of which less than 15 percent is fine sand or coarse sand.  The lower part of the control section contains 2 to 15 percent clay-size carbonates.  A few rock fragments or boulders are on the surface or throughout the soil in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.   It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 percent or more in some part of the Bk horizon and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Thin strata of very fine sand or fine sand are in some pedons.  Loam or clay loam glacial till is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amsterdam, Golva, Omio, Peritsa, Sen and Temvik soils.  Amsterdam soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 15 percent and are influenced by volcanic ash in the lower horizons.  Golva soils formed in silty alluvium on fans and foot slopes.  Omio, Peritsa and Sen soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Temvik soils have glacial till between depths of 20 and 40 inches."

These soils formed in calcareous silty glacial drift, reworked loess or loess.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches."

Amor soils are fine-loamy and are on similar nearby landscapes.  Bowbells, Grassna and Mondamin soils are on lower part of the landscape.  Bowbells soils are fine-loamy and a have a mollic epipedon thicker than 16 inches.  Farland soils have argillic horizons and are on lower parts of the landscape.  Grassna soils have mollic epipedons greater than 16 inches thick and are on similar landscapes. Mondamin soils have a fine-textured argillic horizon and formed in ice-walled lake deposits. Morton soils have argillic horizons, bedrock between depths of 20 to 40 inches and are on lower parts of the landscape.  Niobell, Noonan and Williams soils are in nearby glacial till plains. Niobell and Noonan soils have a natric horizon.  Williams soils have an argillic horizon and are fine-loamy.  The coarse-silty Sutley soils and the Temvik soils are on similar landscapes.  Wilton soils are on less sloping or concave positions and have a thicker mollic epipedon."
