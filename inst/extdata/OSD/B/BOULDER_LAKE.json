  "OVERVIEW": "The Boulder Lake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks.  Boulder Lake soils are on depressions on plateaus and on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Saturated to a depth of 76 to 150 cm in late winter and spring; Seasonal periods of aquic moisture regime when the soil moisture control section is saturated and reduced.\nMean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.\nMean summer soil temperature: 17 to 18 degrees C.\nEffervescence: Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent but ranges to strongly effervescent in some pedons where few to common, very fine to medium filaments or masses of carbonate occur below depths of 50 cm.\nOther features: Reversible trans-horizon cracks are normally open to the soil surface during summer and early fall, are up to 8 cm wide, and are 8 to 15 cm apart.  They decrease in width with increasing depth.  Cracks remain open for fewer than 180 consecutive days.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 40 to 60 percent.\nA horizon\nHue:  10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue:  3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry.\nChroma:  2 or 3 moist, 1 through 3 dry.\nReaction:  Slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nBw horizon (when present) and Bss horizons\nHue: 10YR through 5Y.\nChroma:  2 or 3, moist or dry; some pedons have dry chroma of 1 in the Bss1 horizon; dominantly chroma 2 or less above 51 cm.\nTexture:  Clay or silty clay.\nStructure:  Moderate or strong, very fine to very coarse prismatic, medium to very coarse angular blocky in the upper part and weak to strong, medium to very coarse prismatic and moderate or strong, medium to very coarse angular in the lower subhorizons.\nConsistence:  Very hard or extremely hard, dry; firm or very firm, moist; may be slightly hard and friable in the upper subhorizon.\nRedoximorphic features: Few or common, very fine to medium, distinct or prominent, redox concentrations of iron and manganese with reddish, yellowish and brownish colors that have hue of 10YR through 5YR and chroma of 2 through 6.\nReaction:  Neutral through moderately alkaline.\nVertic features:  Few too many slickensides and many pressure cutans. Soil is interpreted as having reduced matrix colors and redox concentrations due to saturation.\nBk horizon (when present)\nHue: 10YR through 5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7, moist or dry.\nChroma 2 through 6, moist or dry.\nTexture:  Silty clay loam or clay loam.\nClay content: 35 to 40 percent.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived mainly from volcanic rocks such as tuff, basalt, and andesite.  Gilgai microrelief is evident in most areas.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 510 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

These soils are susceptible to occasional or frequent ponding for long duration from December through June with water up to two feet deep.  Some areas are also susceptible to rare ponding for brief or very brief duration during summer and fall months.  Ponding is a result of surface runoff from higher-lying soils and is less than 45 consecutive days in most years."
