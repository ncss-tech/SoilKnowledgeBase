  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to highly fractured bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section average from 35 to 70 percent.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.  The thickness of the solum is 20 to 40 inches and has a base saturation of 35 to 60 percent by ammonium acetate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay.  Clean sand and silt coatings on faces of peds are common in the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons."

Atring, Geppert and Straight soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Barpeak, Farber, Hartless, Kanid, and Kindig soils are over 40 inches deep.  Hilltish soils contain rounded rock fragments throughout and formed in conglomerate from the Riddle Formation.  Inskip, Neuns, and Vena soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Mayacama and Woodin soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Sheetiron soils are dry for over 90 consecutive days and clay minerals are high in the chlorite and mica."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Beekman soils are on mountainous slopes at elevations of 200 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 30 to 100 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium weathered from altered sedimentary and extensive igneous rocks.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F, mean January temperature is 33 degrees F, and mean July temperature is 65 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 35 to 60 inches.  In the interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation ranges to 100 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 235 days."
