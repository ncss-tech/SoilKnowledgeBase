Busterback and Papaspila soils are very deep and do not contain calcium carbonate.  Croesus soils have a particle-size control section with less than 18 percent clay and lack Bk horizons with an effervescent matrix.  Nagitsy soils have noncalcareous soils profiles, cambic horizons and are medium acid or slightly acid.  Namela soils do not have Bk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belsac soils are on mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone or dolostone influenced by calcareous loess.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,895 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is cold, continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 460 mm, additional moisture may be derived as a result of snow accumulation through drifting; mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 70 days."
