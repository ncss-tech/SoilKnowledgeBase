  "OVERVIEW": "The Belsac series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone or dolostone influenced by calcareous loess.  The Belsac soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
