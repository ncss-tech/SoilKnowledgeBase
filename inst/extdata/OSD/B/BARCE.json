The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash and till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 940 mm (35 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 185 days. Elevation is 143 to 278 meters (470 to 915 feet) above mean sea level."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low or moderately low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy sediments and moderately slow in the loamy till subsoil, and slow or very slow in the till substratum."
