  "OVERVIEW": "The Barce series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash and till. Barce soils are on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
