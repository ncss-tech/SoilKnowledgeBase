The soils formed in alluvium derived mostly from tuff and basalt. The climate is cool, semiarid. Mean annual precipitation is 175 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 8 degrees C, mean January temperature of about -2 to -3 degrees C, and mean July temperature of about 20.6 to 21 degrees C. The frost free period is 70 to 90 days."
