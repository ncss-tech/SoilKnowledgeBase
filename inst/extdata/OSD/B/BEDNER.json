  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 degrees to 50 degrees F. Soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches about 70 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 35 inches. The solum is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist. The B2t horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist, 1 or 2 dry. It is clay loam or clay. The Bt horizon averages 35 to 50 percent clay and has stress oriented fabric in the major part.\nThe C1sim horizon (duripan) lacks indurated continuous opal caps or indurated subhorizons, and dry fragments do not completely slake in water during prolonged wetting."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Applegate and Hutchinson series in the same family and the Gribble and Modoc series. Applegate soils have hue of 5YR and chroma of 4 in the Bt horizon and have very gravelly duripans. Gribble soils average 35 to 60 percent pebbles and 0 cobbles in the R2t horizon. Hutchinson soils have silt loam A1 horizons reflecting influence of loess and volcanic ash. Also, the duripan in Hutchinson soils usually has 15 to 25 percent pebbles. Modoc soils are usually dry, fine-loamy, and have indurated hardpans."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bedner soils are on nearly level terraces at elevations of 4,085 to 4,200 feet. The soils formed in sediments weathered from tuff, basalt, and small amounts of ash. The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. Mean January temperature is 26 degrees to 28 degrees F., mean July temperature is 66 degrees to 67 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Calder, Laki, Malin, and Scherrard soils. Calder soils have ochric epipedons and have abrupt clay increase at the upper boundary of the Bt horizon. Laki soils are calcareous, lack duripans and have loam and fine sandy loam B horizons.  Malin and Scherrard soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline. Malin soils also lack duripans."
