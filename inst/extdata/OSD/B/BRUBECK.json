  "OVERVIEW": "The Brubeck series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Brubeck soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
