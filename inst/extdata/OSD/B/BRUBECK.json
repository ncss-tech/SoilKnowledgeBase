  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brubeck soils are on plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt or andesite.  Cobbles and stones occur on the surface 5 cm and cover up to about 55 percent of the area.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,850 meters.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm and total annual snowfall is 500 to 760 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
