The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 66 degrees F.  The control section averages 5 to 18 percent clay and has more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Sandstone fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are less than 3 inches in diameter.  Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  The moisture control section is usually dry, but is moist in April, May, and early June..\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is mildly through strongly alkaline.  A Bk or Bw horizon may be present but is nondiagnostic."
