Brookston, Cordova, and Jameston soils average more than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Clackamas, Millgrove, and Westland soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Forestcity and Hamel soils have mollic epipedons that are more than 38 cm (15 in) thick. Navan, Radioville, and Rensselaer soils average less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. Navunon and Tallmadge soils commonly have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 in). Nosoni soils have sola thicker than 127 cm (50 in)."

The well drained Lapeer, moderately well drained Dryden, and somewhat poorly drained Locke soils are in a drainage sequence with Barry soils and are on higher landscape positions. The Palms soils are herbaceous organic material overlying loamy deposits in closed depressions on slightly lower landscape positions."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. The low precipitation phase has a seasonal high water table at depths of 30 to 76 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) between November and July. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately high or moderately low. Permeability is moderate."

Aquic conditions: reduced matrix colors, redox concentrations, and/or iron depletions present in all horizons below the mollic epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record No: MI0035; MI0664 - LOW PRECIPITATION PHASE. This phase may become a new series when its area of occurrence is updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
