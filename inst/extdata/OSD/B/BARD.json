Crossen soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on ustic and have 15 to 35 percent course fragments in the particle-size control section. Mormon Mesa soils have petrocalcic horizons thicker than 4 feet. Upton soils have 15 to 30 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent course fragments in the particle-size control section. Woda soils contain 20 to 30 percent clay in the control section. Wodavar soils contain gypsum above the hardpan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bard soils are on valley fill terraces, alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,600 to 3,000 feet. These soils formed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from limestone and dolomite with some sandstone and quartzite. The climate is arid, with hot dry summers and warm, occasionally moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches; mean annual temperature is 61 to 68 degrees F.(the mean January temperature is about 43 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F.), The frost free season is about 180 to 270 days."
