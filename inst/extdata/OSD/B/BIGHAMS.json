  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bighams series consists of moderately deep, well drained moderately permeable soils on plateaus, hills, and hillslopes. These soils formed in eolian deposits over local alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and mudstone. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches (279 mm) and the average annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F (11 degrees C).",
