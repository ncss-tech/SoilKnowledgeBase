These soils formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived dominantly from interbedded sandstone and mudstone. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Elevation is 6300 to 6700 feet (1920 to 2042 meters). The average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches (254 to 356 mm), the average annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F (10 to 11 degrees C), and the frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."
