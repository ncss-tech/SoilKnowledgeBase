  "OVERVIEW": "The Barling series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in silty alluvium derived from siltstone, sandstone and shale.  These soils are on level to nearly level flood plains in Boston Mountains and Arkansas River Valley.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 37 inches.\nSlopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

The soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the A and BA or AB horizons and slightly acid to very strongly acid in the Bw horizon.  Depth to horizons with redox depletions of chroma 2 or less ranges from 10 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4, or value of 5, and chroma of 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown.  The Bw2, Bw3 and Bw4 horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6, and iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown or gray.  Some pedons have no dominant hue in the lower Bw horizons, and have iron accumulations and depletions in shades of gray and brown in about equal amounts.  In some pedons, at depths greater than 30 inches, the lower Bw horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 and iron accumulations in shades of brown.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam."
