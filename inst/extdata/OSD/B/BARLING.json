The soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the A and BA or AB horizons and slightly acid to very strongly acid in the Bw horizon.  Depth to horizons with redox depletions of chroma 2 or less ranges from 10 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4, or value of 5, and chroma of 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown.  The Bw2, Bw3 and Bw4 horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6, and iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown or gray.  Some pedons have no dominant hue in the lower Bw horizons, and have iron accumulations and depletions in shades of gray and brown in about equal amounts.  In some pedons, at depths greater than 30 inches, the lower Bw horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 and iron accumulations in shades of brown.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam."

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Barling soils formed in silty alluvium derived from siltstone, shale, and sandstone.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 62 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches."

These soils have aquic moisture regimes and contain a fragipan.  Leadvale soils occur in adjacent valleys.  These soils contain an argillic horizon and a fragipan.  The well drained, Spadra soils occur adjacent low terraces and fans.  These soils have 40 to 60 inch sola and contain argillic horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained, Taft soils occur in adjacent valleys.  These soils contain glossic and argillic horizons and a fragipan."
