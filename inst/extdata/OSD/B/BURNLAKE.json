Nanny soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Tallac soils have umbric epipedons 20 to 35 inches thick, have a brittle manner of failure in some horizons, and do not have cambic horizons.  Undusk soils have 18 to 25 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have the upper 4 to 6 inches strongly influenced by volcanic ash."
