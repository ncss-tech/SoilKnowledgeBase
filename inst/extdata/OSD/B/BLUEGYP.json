  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluegyp series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks. Bluegyp soils are on dissected pediments. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
