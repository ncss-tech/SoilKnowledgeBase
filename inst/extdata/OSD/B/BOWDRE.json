  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the contrasting loamy 2C horizon ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral in the A horizon and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe matrix of the B horizon has the same range in color as the A horizon and has few to many mottles in shades of brown or gray.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon typically is mottled in shades of brown and gray; some pedons have a brownish matrix with mottles having chroma of 2 or less.  It is stratified silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin strata of silty clay loam.  The 3C horizon has the same range in color as the 2C horizon.  The 3C horizon is loamy sand or sandy loam or is stratified sandy material.  Strata of silty clay loam or silt loam are in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Other series with common properties include the Bruin, Catalpa, Commerce, Earle, Mhoon, Newellton, and Tunica series.  None of these, except Catalpa soils, have a mollic epipedon.  Catalpa soils are fine in the particle-size control section.  Bruin soils are coarse-silty in the particle-size control section.  Commerce and Mhoon soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section.  Earle and Tunica soils have a clayey solum that is 20 to 36 inches thick."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These are nearly level to undulating soils on the floodplain of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in layered alluvium consisting of a thin clayey layer and the underlying loamy and sandy sediments.  Most areas are protected from flooding by levees.  Mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches."

None of these have a mollic epipedon.  Also, Dubbs and Dundee soils are fine-silty, Robinsonville soils are coarse-loamy, and Sharkey soils are very fine in the particle-size control sections.  Moderately well drained Bruin, and somewhat poorly drained Commerce and Dundee, and well drained Robinsonville soils are in slightly higher positions on natural levees.  Somewhat poorly drained Newellton and poorly drained Sharkey and Tunica soils are in slackwater areas."

The water table fluctuates between a depth of 1.5 to 2.0 feet during winter and early in spring.  Unless protected by levees, this soil is subject to flooding."
