  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum horizons ranges from 40 to more than 70 inches.  Intersecting slickensides are at a depth ranging from 18 to 38 inches below the surface.  Cycles of micro-lows and micro-highs are repeated about every 7 to 20 feet.  Thickness of horizons with a color value of less than 3.5 and chroma of 1.5 or more ranges from 16 to 25 inches in the center of the micro-lows and from 6 to 14 inches in the center of the micro-highs.  The extremes of amplitude or waviness of the boundary between the A and Bw horizons vary from 8 to 38 inches from the center of the micro-highs to the center of the micro-lows.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3, or it has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y with value of 3, and chroma of 2 in the upper 12 inches in more than half of each pedon; also allowed are hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 and hue of 10YR, 2.5Y and 5Y, value of 4 and chroma of 2.  Few to many distinct and prominent mottles of red, yellowish red, and dark yellowish brown are within 20 inches of the surface.  The Ap and A1 horizons are silty clay loam or silty clay; and the A2 horizon is silty clay or clay.  The A horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid, except in areas where the surface layer has been limed.\nThe Bw subhorizons and the C horizon have hue 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, or hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2, or they are mottled in shades of the above colors.  The Bw and C horizons are silty clay or clay.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section has 35 to 55 percent clay.  The Bw and C horizons are neutral to moderately alkaline.  Brown and black concretions commonly are few to many in the A and Bw horizons.  Few to many lime nodules are in the lower part of the Bw and C horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Terouge and Zilaboy series in the same family and the similar Beaumont, Houston, Kipling, Okolona, Sumter, and Vaiden series.  Terouge soils are neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  Zilaboy soils have a summer moisture deficit of more than 5 inches and, in addition, are on flood plains.  Beaumont soils have chroma of less than 1.5 and are grayer throughout.  Houston soils do not have distinct or prominent mottles in the upper 20 inches, have more than 60 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section, and are less acid in upper part of the solum.  Kipling soils have a Bt horizon that is typically yellowish brown.  Okolona soils do not have distinct or prominent mottles within 20 inches of the surface.  Sumter soils do not have intersecting slickensides, are shallower to chalk, and are calcareous.  Vaiden soils have a moist color value of more than 3.5 in the A horizon, are more acid in the upper part of the solum, and have more than 60 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brooksville soils are on uplands in the Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Area.  These are nearly level to gently sloping soils that formed in acid clay or silty clay underlain by calcareous materials or chalk.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Average annual precipitation is about 48.0 inches and average annual temperature is about 63.0 degrees Fahrenheit near the type location."

Houston, Kipling, Okolona, and Vaiden soils are in similar landscape positions as the Brooksville soils.  Griffith soils, which are on flood plains, have amplitude of waviness between the A and Bw horizons of 6 to 10 inches and the A horizon is 24 to 48 inches thick."
