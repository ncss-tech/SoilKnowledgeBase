  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Broe series consists very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from tuff, ash, basaltic and andesitic rocks. Broe soils are on fan remnants and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
