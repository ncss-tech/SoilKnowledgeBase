  "OVERVIEW": "The Bewearze series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
