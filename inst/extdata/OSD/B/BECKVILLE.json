    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Middlebury series. Similar series that have an active cation-exchange activity class are the Oldenburg and Waterford series. Middlebury and Oldenburg soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Waterford soils have textures that average more than 80 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beckville soils are on flood plains in areas of Wisconsin aged glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in recent loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 175 to 190 days. Elevation is 143 to 305 meters (470 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cohoctah, Shoals, and Stonelick soils. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Cohoctah soils have a mollic epipedon and are in depressions or oxbows. The somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils have grayer subsoils and are on lower lying positions. The well drained Stonelick soils do not have redox features and are on higher lying positions."

Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 46 to 76 cm (1.5 to 2.5 feet) between December and March in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid. This soil is subject to flooding."
