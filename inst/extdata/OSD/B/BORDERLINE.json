  "OVERVIEW": "The Borderline series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Borderline soils are on fan  piedmonts.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches (279 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F (17.8 degrees C).",
