  "OVERVIEW": "The Boquet series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in residual material from herbaceous material overlying mixed alluvium. These soils form in marshes, swales, and flood plains of narrow streams on slopes 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
