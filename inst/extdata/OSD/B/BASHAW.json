The mean annual precipitation typically is 1000 to 1500 mm in MLRA 2 and 750 to 1400 mm in MLRA 5. The frost-free period generally is 165 to 210 days in MLRA 2.\n08/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). Most of the changes were in formatting. No major technical changes were made. Update projects have been proposed to determine whether the concepts of the Bashaw series should extend into MLRA 5.\n05/94--The classification was changed from Typic Pelloxererts to Xeric Endoaquerts.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data--sample numbers S99OR-043-001, S96OR-043-003, and S92OR-003-004; Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE; 12/01\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
