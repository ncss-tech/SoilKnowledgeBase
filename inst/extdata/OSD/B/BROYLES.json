  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broyles soils are on fan aprons, fan remnants, inset fans, fan skirts, beach plains, and alluvial fans. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,980 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
