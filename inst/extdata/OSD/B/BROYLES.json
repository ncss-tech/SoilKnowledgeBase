  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Broyles series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a thin surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  Broyles soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, fan aprons, inset fans, beach plains, and alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
