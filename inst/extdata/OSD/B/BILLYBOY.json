Horizonation has a wide range depending upon the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occured.  Therefore there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singularly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
