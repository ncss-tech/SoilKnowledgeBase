  "OVERVIEW": "The Black Butte series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed over bank deposits derived from mixed rock sources. Black Butte soils are on floodplains. Slopes are from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.",
