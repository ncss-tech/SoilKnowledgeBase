    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Black Butte soils are on flood plains with slopes between 0 and 2 percent Parent materials have been derived from a wide mixture of rocks but are dominantly from sedimentary formations including limestone, sandstone, shale, and Precambrian gneiss and shist. Elevations range from 1,200 to 2,000 feet. The climate is arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 7 inches, mean annual temperature is about 66 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 180 to 300 days."

Formally classified as fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, calcareous, thermic Typic Torriorthents\nAdditional data: This pedon has been sampled and characterized by the NSSL, reference S04NV-003002-1, 8.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from about 0 to 2 inches. (A horizon)\nSalic horizon - The zone from the surface to about 13 inches. (Az1, Az2 and Byz horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (The lower part of the Byz and the 2Byz1, 2Byz2, 2Byz2, and the upper part of the 3C1 horizon).\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015.
