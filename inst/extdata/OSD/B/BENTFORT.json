(Bk horizon)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: In the zone from 38 to 84 centimeters (15 to 33 inches)  (Bk horizon)\nEndosaturation: The zone of saturation from 38 to 200 centimeters (Bk, 2C1, and 2C2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the Bk and 2C1 horizon.\nOther features:  Ustic aridic moisture regime, mesic temperature regime.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nThis soil was previously identified as Rocky Ford, sand substratum phase on flood plains that are occasionally flooded. The Bentfort series will replace that phase in the Arkansas River Valley in Colorado.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
