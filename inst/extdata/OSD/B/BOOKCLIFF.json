  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bookcliff soils are on narrow reverse structural benches of landslides and on mountainsides at elevations of 6,400 to 8,900 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches.  The freeze-free period is 60 to 110 days."
