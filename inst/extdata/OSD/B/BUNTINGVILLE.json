  "OVERVIEW": "Buntingville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on fan remnants and terraces. The soils formed in ashy loamy alluvium derived primarily from tuffs, andesite, basalt, and tuff breccias. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 millimeters (13 inches). The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (49 degrees F.).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Buntingville soils were formerly classified as Humic Gley soils. The type location was moved from Honey Lake Valley Area, Lassen County to Modoc County, California, in 1971. Reclassified in 2005 based on optical grain count at the recovered type location and application of current Soil Taxonomy. Classification was Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls prior to the revision.\nDiagnostic Horizons and Features Recognized in this Pedon:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 81 cm (0 to 32 inches) (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 81 cm (4 to 32 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons).\nVitrandic feature - All horizons in the upper 75 cm (30 inches) contain more than 30 percent volcanic ash and glass in the coarse silt to sand fractions.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 60 cm (4 to 24 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
