The soils formed in ashy loamy alluvium derived primarily from tuffs, andesite, basalt, and tuff breccias. Climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 305 to 406 millimeters (12 to 16 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C. (48 to 53 degrees F.), frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."

Bidwell soils are well drained and have 10 to 16 inch thick mollic epipedons. Bieber soils have fine-textured argillic horizons and duripans. Goose Lake soils have E horizons and fine-textured argillic horizons.  Modoc soils are well drained and have duripans. Pit soils are fine-textured and contain many slickensides. Surprise soils do not have argillic horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Buntingville soils were formerly classified as Humic Gley soils. The type location was moved from Honey Lake Valley Area, Lassen County to Modoc County, California, in 1971. Reclassified in 2005 based on optical grain count at the recovered type location and application of current Soil Taxonomy. Classification was Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls prior to the revision.\nDiagnostic Horizons and Features Recognized in this Pedon:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 81 cm (0 to 32 inches) (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 81 cm (4 to 32 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons).\nVitrandic feature - All horizons in the upper 75 cm (30 inches) contain more than 30 percent volcanic ash and glass in the coarse silt to sand fractions.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 60 cm (4 to 24 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
