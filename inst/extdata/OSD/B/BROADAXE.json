Under excellent water quality these soils support seagrass species including but not limited to shoalweed (Halodule wrightii), manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme), and Englemann's seagrass (Halophila englemannii). Shallower areas may support widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima). Under degraded / poor water quality seagrass may be replaced by rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families. Caulerpa prolifera (Chlorophyta) is often dominant. Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 80 percent.\""
