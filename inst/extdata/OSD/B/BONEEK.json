Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches and extends into the Bt horizon of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is silt loam, but some pedons are loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Average clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam averaging between 30 and 40 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They typically are silt loam or silty clay loam, but some pedons are loam.  They are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate are in the Bk horizon.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR."

Ashfork, Blackpipe, Boquillas, Chapin, Emigrant, Huggins, Leyden, Thunderbird, and Wormser soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches. Collbran soils have a high percentage of ferromagnesium minerals in the sand and silt fractions.  Nunn, Rednun, and Standley soils contain more fine sand and coarser.  Kube, Querc, Richfield, and Savo soils have yellower hue in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Showlow soils contain more rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Sofia soils contain more clay.  Torreon soils have calcic horizons and formed in sediments influenced by basalt."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boneek soils are nearly level to moderately sloping on high terraces and uplands.  Surfaces are plane to slightly convex and slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in a silty mantle overlying sandstone or siltstones, or in loess or silty alluvium.   Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 48 degrees, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches. Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Butche, Canyon, Lakoa, Norka, Tilford, and Vale soils.  The shallow Butche and Canyon soils do not have mollic epipedons.  They are on adjacent higher landscapes to the Boneek soils.  Lakoa soils formed under forest vegetation, have E horizons, and primarily have steep slopes.  Norka soils are fine-silty and are on similiar landscapes.  The fine-silty Tilford soils are on steeper more convex landscapes. Vale soils are fine-silty and are on lower terraces."
