  "OVERVIEW": "The Brad series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on strongly sloping to very steep mountainsides.  They formed in residuum from sandstone.  Slope ranges from 15 to 80 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm.",
