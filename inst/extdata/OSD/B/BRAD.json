  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. The soil is 10 to 20 inches deep over sandstone.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 63 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section in more than 7 out of 10 years.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 80 percent coarse fragments.  Textures are very cobbly loamy sand, very cobbly loamy fine sand or extremely stony loamy sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral or slightly acid.  AC or C horizons separate the A horizon and R layer in some pedons.  Where present, the C horizon is similar to the A horizon except that the value is 5.5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma is 3 or 4."
