  "OVERVIEW": "The Barden series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of loess or other silty material and residuum from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on ridges and upland side slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",

(A horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 46 to 142 cm (18 to 56 inches).  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe soil is not a mollisol because of base saturation in the argillic horizon is less than 50 percent. The original description did not include a lithologic discontinuity between the loess and shale. This has been updated to reflect the discontinuity.  There is a potential of several lithological discontinuities.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\n7/19/01 - PRF- moved to a semi tab format.  Included the discontinuity, added new series as associated soils"
