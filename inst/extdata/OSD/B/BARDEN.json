    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 46 cm to 97 cm (18 to 38 inches).\nMollic epipedon: The zone from o to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches).  (A horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 46 to 142 cm (18 to 56 inches).  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe soil is not a mollisol because of base saturation in the argillic horizon is less than 50 percent. The original description did not include a lithologic discontinuity between the loess and shale. This has been updated to reflect the discontinuity.  There is a potential of several lithological discontinuities.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\n7/19/01 - PRF- moved to a semi tab format.  Included the discontinuity, added new series as associated soils\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
