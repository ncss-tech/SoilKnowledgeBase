    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice in most years.  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 54 degrees F. Soft siltstone and sandstone fragments average 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section. The particle-size control section is 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A & AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry; and chroma of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 6 dry. It is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam. Soft siltstone and sandstone fragments range from 25 to 60 percent.\nThe BCt horizon has 40 to 85 percent soft siltstone and sandstone fragments. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam. This horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

They formed in colluvium and residuum from siltstone, shale and fine-grained sandstone.  Average annual temperature is 47 degrees to 52 degrees F.  Annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 75 inches.  Growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 240 days."
