  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from siltstone, shale, and fine grained sandstone on uplands at elevations of 200 to 1,800 feet. Slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 65 inches and average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Average annual soil temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 54 degrees F. Soft siltstone and sandstone fragments average 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section. The particle-size control section is 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A & AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry; and chroma of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 6 dry. It is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam. Soft siltstone and sandstone fragments range from 25 to 60 percent.\nThe BCt horizon has 40 to 85 percent soft siltstone and sandstone fragments. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam. This horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid."
