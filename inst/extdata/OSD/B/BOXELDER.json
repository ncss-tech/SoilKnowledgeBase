  "OVERVIEW": "The Boxelder series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately to moderately slowly permeable soils formed in lake sediments derived from white diatomaceous calcareous deposits.  These soils are on nearly level lake terraces and lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The coarse fragment content is 0 to 15 percent.  The weighted average calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 60 percent in the control section.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 12 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and 3 or 4 moist, with chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and 3 or 4 moist, with chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 is 35 percent.  Texture is stratified silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8, and 5 to 7 moist, with chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 45 percent.  Texture is a silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8, and 6 or 7 moist, with chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.  Depth to diatomaceous lacustrine material and thin discontinuous lenses of black ash gravel and sand size cinders material ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent. The weighted-average calcium carbonate equivalent is 35 to 60 percent.  Texture is stratified silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam."
