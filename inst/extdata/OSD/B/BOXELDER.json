Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 12 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and 3 or 4 moist, with chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and 3 or 4 moist, with chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 is 35 percent.  Texture is stratified silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8, and 5 to 7 moist, with chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 45 percent.

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F. Frost free period ranges from 110 to 160 days."
