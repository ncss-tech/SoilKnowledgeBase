Burnette, Faim, Grouseville, Teedown and Toponce soils have colors yellower than 7.5YR.  Cochetopa, Fulcher, and Paulson soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate within the profile.  Friana and Luna soils are formed in volcanics and have a lower bulk density than Bischoff soils.  Guero soils contain BCt horizons, receive 24 to 28 inches of precipitation, half of which fall during summer, and have an over story of aspen.  Mancos, Mayflower, Richens, Runlett, and Skutum soils are less than 60 inches deep.  Perinos soils have clay or clay loam argillic horizons.  Slights soils are formed in mud flow deposits and contain a high percentage of stones and boulders in the profile.  Sudpeak soils have a seasonal high water table."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F.  The frost free period is 50 to 70 days."

They are on convex slopes adjacent to Bischoff soils.  Halfcircle soils are deep to a paralithic contact and are calcareous in the control section.  Halfcircle soils are on north facing mountains.  Woodcanyon soils are moderately deep and are on south facing, smooth to convex slopes."
