  "OVERVIEW": "The Bischoff series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium on hills and mountains.  Permeability is slow.  Bischoff soils have slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Burnette, Faim, Grouseville, Teedown and Toponce soils have colors yellower than 7.5YR.  Cochetopa, Fulcher, and Paulson soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate within the profile.  Friana and Luna soils are formed in volcanics and have a lower bulk density than Bischoff soils.  Guero soils contain BCt horizons, receive 24 to 28 inches of precipitation, half of which fall during summer, and have an over story of aspen.  Mancos, Mayflower, Richens, Runlett, and Skutum soils are less than 60 inches deep.  Perinos soils have clay or clay loam argillic horizons.  Slights soils are formed in mud flow deposits and contain a high percentage of stones and boulders in the profile.  Sudpeak soils have a seasonal high water table."
