  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beckwith series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils occur on slightly concave to nearly level positions on interfluves on dissected till plains and on treads of stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 953 millimeters.",
