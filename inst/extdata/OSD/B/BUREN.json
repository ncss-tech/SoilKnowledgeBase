  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the weakly cemented horizon ranges from 27 to 40 inches.  There are less than 1 to about 10 percent rock fragments in the solum.  The mean soil temperature is about 65 degrees F, and is never below 47 degrees F.  The soils are continuously moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches from about mid-December until May and are continuously dry all the rest of the time.\nThe Buren series have yellowish brown and brown, moderately alkaline, fine sandy loam A horizons.  The A horizon is grayish brown, pale brown or yellowish brown with chroma of 2 through 4 and value of 5 or 6.  It contains less than 1 percent organic matter.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard, and the immediate surface may or may not be both massive and hard.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline and is not calcareous.\nThey have brown and pale brown, moderately alkaline, clay loam B2t horizons.  The B2t horizon has the following Munsel notations: 10YR 6/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3 and 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, and 4/4.  It is heavy loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with about 20 to 30 percent clay.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline, but only the lower part is calcareous.  The lower B2t and/or B3 horizon have lime segregations.\nThey have yellowish brown, weakly cemented Csi horizons.  The C1si horizon has a clear or abrupt upper boundary and roots do not penetrate except along prism faces.  The upper surface does not generally have opal coating or the surface is only very thinly coated.  Thin silica and lime coatings are more prominent on prism faces than on the tops.  The Csi horizon is yellowish brown to light brownish gray, or light yellowish brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  It is firm or extremely firm and very hard.  This horizon is brittle to somewhat brittle and does not slake after prolonged immersion in water."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arlington, Betteravia, Chesterton, Redding, Rocklin, San Joaquin, Yokohl, and Ysidora series.  Arlington soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Betteravia soils have thick sandy A horizons.  Chesterton, Redding, and San Joaquin soils have abrupt upper boundaries to an argillic horizon that has more than 35 percent clay.  Rocklin soils have a continuous opal coating at the top of the duripan which is also indurated in thin sheets.  Yokohl soils have more than 35 percent clay.  Ysidora soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments and the dominant hue is 2.5YR or 5YR in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on gently to strongly sloping alluvial fans and terraces at elevations of about 700 to 3,000 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium derived mostly from basic igneous rocks and partly from other crystalline rocks.  They occur in a semiarid mesothermal climate with an average annual precipitation of 12 to 15 inches, an average January temperature of 51 degrees F, and average July temperature of 76 degrees F, and an average annual temperature of 61 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 230 to 300 days."
