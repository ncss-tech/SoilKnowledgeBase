Bassfield soils have Bt horizons with hue redder than 5YR.  Latonia soils have 20 to 45 inch sola thickness.  Rumford soils have less than 20 percent silt in the Bt horizon.  Attoyac, Bernaldo, Besner, Bienville, and Messer soils have base saturation greater than 35 percent, and in addition Bienville soils have a sandy particle-size class.  Benndale, Heidel, McLaurin, and Niwana soils do not have 20 percent clay decrease within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Messer soils have a coarse-silty particle-size class."

These soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy alluvial sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 63 to 70 degrees F. and average rainfall averages 55 to 60 inches."
