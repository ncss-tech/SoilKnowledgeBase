  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick. Depth to soft bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Most pedons have manganese concretions in the solum. The A, E, BA, BE, and Bt horizons range from strongly acid through neutral and the BC, CB, and C horizons range from moderately acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BA or BE horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. They range from sandy loam through clay.\nThe Btss horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 3 or less are in the upper 10 inches.  Some subhorizons are mottled without dominant matrix color. The Btss horizon is dominantly clay, but ranges to include clay loam and sandy clay.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 2 to 8 or are mottled without dominant matrix hue. Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, commonly is multicolored. It is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam saprolite.\nThe Cr horizon is partially weathered, fractured basic igneous and metamorphic rock."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  Soils in similar families include the Crawfordville and Virgilina series.  Crawfordville soils do not have a very high shrink-swell potential and have an abrupt texture change.  Virgilina soils have smectitic mineralogy and a depth to lithic contact of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brewback soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands of the thermic southern Piedmont. Slopes are usually broad and only slightly dissected, with gradients ranging from 0 to 15 percent. The bedrock is weathered diabase and similar rock materials. Mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches. The frost free period ranges from 195 to 210 days."

Iredell soils are well drained and Pittsboro soils are moderately well drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap and E horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 30 inches (Bt, Btss, and BCt horizons).\n3. Aquertic feature - iron depletions in upper 10 inches of Bt horizon and a linear extensibility of 6.0 or more between the surface and the paralithic contact.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name     Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip    Elevation\nBREWBACK    0-15   60-62     195-210    40-45     250-500\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH   Watertable   Kind           Months      Bedrock   Hardness\nNONE                   0.5-2.5      PERCHED  DEC-MAY   20-40      SOFT\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture            3-Inch   No-10    Clay%    -CEC-\n0-6      FSL SL               0-0      75-100   10-20         -\n6-9      CL C                    0-0     75-100    18-40         -\n9-28    C SC                    0-0     75-100    35-60         -\n28-30   CL SCL               0-0     75-100    10-35          -\n30     WB                  -        -       -      -\nSOI-5  Depth      -pH-       O.M.
