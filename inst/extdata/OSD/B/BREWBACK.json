  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Brewback series are moderately deep and somewhat poorly drained. They formed in residuum from basic rocks or mixed acid and basic rocks on Piedmont uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is above 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

Most pedons have manganese concretions in the solum. The A, E, BA, BE, and Bt horizons range from strongly acid through neutral and the BC, CB, and C horizons range from moderately acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BA or BE horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. They range from sandy loam through clay.\nThe Btss horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 3 or less are in the upper 10 inches.  Some subhorizons are mottled without dominant matrix color. The Btss horizon is dominantly clay, but ranges to include clay loam and sandy clay.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 2 to 8 or are mottled without dominant matrix hue. Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, commonly is multicolored. It is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam saprolite.\nThe Cr horizon is partially weathered, fractured basic igneous and metamorphic rock."
