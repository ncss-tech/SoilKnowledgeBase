  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 90\ninches.  Thickness of the loamy sediments containing gravel ranges\nfrom 10 to 30 inches.  Reaction of the A horizon ranges from very\nstrongly acid through slightly acid.  Reaction of the B horizon\nranges from very strongly acid through medium acid.  The A and B1\nhorizons have 5 to 35 percent rounded gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, values 4 or 5, and chroma of 2\nthrough 6.  Textures are gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy\nloam, gravelly loam, and their non-gravelly phases.  Some pedons\nhave thin dark colored A1 and yellowish brown A2 horizons.\nThe B1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and\nchroma of 4 through 8.  Textures are gravelly fine sandy loam,\ngravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, and their non-gravelly phases.\nThe B2t horizon is centered on the 5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and\nchroma of 4 through 8.  Subhorizons with hues of 7.5YR and 2.5YR,\nvalue 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8 are included.  Most pedons\nhave few to many brown and yellow mottles.  The B21t horizon has\nfrom 0 to 15 percent gravel.  B22t and B23t horizons commonly have\nfew to many particles of mica.  The B22t and B23t horizons have\nfew to many pockets of clean uncoated sand grains and few to\ncommon vertical streaks of sand grains.  Most pedons have a clay\ndecrease at 50 inches below the top of the argillic.  These\nhorizons have from 2 to 15 percent by volume angular fragments of\nsoft or hard sandstone.  The B21t and B22t horizons are loam,\nsandy clay loam, or clay loam.  The B23t horizon is fine sandy\nloam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam."

Claiborne\nand Trimble soils lack gravel in the upper solum.  Nolichucky\nsoils do not decrease in clay, and lack pockets and streaks of\nuncoated sand grains.  Claiborne soils have 5 to 25 percent\nfragments of chert in each horizon.  Trimble soils have 15 to 35\npercent fragments of chert, sandstone, or siltstone in each\nhorizon.  Portia soils lack gravel in the surface layers and\npockets or streaks of clean uncoated sand grains.  Agnos, Baxter,\nBode\n, Braddock, Christian, Muse, Sequoia, and Trappist soils have more\nthan 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic\nxorizon.  In addition, Boden soils are underlain with sandstone\nbedrock at 40 to 60 inches."
