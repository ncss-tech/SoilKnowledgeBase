  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments, mainly limestone and shale, are 0 to 15 percent by volume in the Ap horizon, 2 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon, and 10 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, (5 or 6 dry) and chroma of 3 or 4. The Ap and A horizons are silt loam or silty clay loam.  They are strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon is mixed in the Ap in most pedons.  Some undisturbed pedons have an E horizon 3 to 6 inches thick.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 3 to 6; and low chroma mottles are in the lower part.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with some very thin strata having channery analogues of these textures.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BC and C horizons commonly have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 2 to 6; and may have mottles of high or low chroma. Some pedons range to chroma of 1 in the C horizon.  The BC and C horizons are silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their channery analogues.  They are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and typically contain free carbonates.\nBedrock is calcareous soft shale with some thin strata of limestone. It commonly occurs in shades of gray or olive, but is brown in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alexandria, Edom, Lairdsville, Lucas, Millheim, Morley, Pate, Saylesville, Schoharie, and St. Clair series.  Alexandria, Morley, and St. Clair soils formed all or partly in till and contain glacial pebbles and stones.  Edom soils lack 2 chroma mottles in the solum.  Lairdsville soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Lucas and Saylesville soils formed in lacustrine sediments and contain none or few rock fragments. Millheim soils contain rock fragments of dark carbonaceaus shale.  Pate soils have thicker sola.  Schoharie soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in all or part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brushcreek soils are on uplands.  They are on long foot slopes and have slope gradients ranging from 6 to 25 percent.  The soils formed mainly in colluvium and residuum weathered from interbedded Ordovician calcareous shale and some thin strata of limestone.  Average annual precipitation is about 40 to 45 inches, and average annual temperature is about 53 to 55 degrees F."

Aaron soils also are moderately well drained but are on broad ridges below Brushcreek soils. Bratton and Crider soils are well drained and are on broad ridgetops above Brushcreek soils.  In addition Crider soils are fine-silty.  Eden and Faywood soils are on side slopes and narrow ridge crests and are moderately deep to bedrock. Lawshe soils are on similar landscapes but have mollic epipedons. Nicholson soils are on broad ridgetops, have a thick mantle of silt over clayey residuum, and have a fragipan.  Opequon soils are on sloping to steep side slopes above Brushcreek soils and are shallow to limestone."
