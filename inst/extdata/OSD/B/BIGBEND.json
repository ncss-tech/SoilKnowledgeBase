  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The particle size control section is very fine sandy loam or silt loam averaging 8 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarse sand.   The soil commonly contains free carbonates throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Those pedons that have moist values of 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  It is typically very fine sandy loam or silt loam, but includes loam, silty clay loam, and fine sandy loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have an AC horizon that is intermediate in color and texture between the A and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically very fine sandy loam and silt loam, but includes strata of loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand,and silty clay loam.  Below a depth of 40 inches, textures range from very fine sandy loam to gravelly sand.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

The Bigbend soils formed in calcareous, stratified, loamy alluvial material.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches."

Native grasses are dominantly big bluestem, western wheatgrass, needlegrasses, little bluestem, switchgrass, sedges and forbs.  Shrubs and a few deciduous trees are in some of the lower lying areas."
