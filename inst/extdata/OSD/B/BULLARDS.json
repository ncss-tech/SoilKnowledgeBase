  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils have a udic moisture regime, but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The Bs horizon is 24 to 45 inches thick and has 15 to 35 percent 2 to 20 mm iron cemented nodules.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Some pedons lack an A horizon and have an E horizon.  It is sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry. It is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam and has 8 to 18 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 8 moist and dry.  It is loamy fine sand or sand with a thin weakly cemented lense in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bullards soils are on deeply dissected marine terraces at elevations of 15 to 600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in sandy alluvial and eolian materials on old sand dunes and back-beach deposits.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 300 days."

Bandon and Blacklock soils have a cemented pan and Blacklock soils are poorly drained.  Ferrelo soils lack a spodic horizon and have an umbric epipedon.  Templeton soils lack a spodic horizon and are fine-silty."
