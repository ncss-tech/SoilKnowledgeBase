    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils have a udic moisture regime, but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The Bs horizon is 24 to 45 inches thick and has 15 to 35 percent 2 to 20 mm iron cemented nodules.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Some pedons lack an A horizon and have an E horizon.  It is sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry. It is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam and has 8 to 18 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 8 moist and dry.  It is loamy fine sand or sand with a thin weakly cemented lense in some pedons."
