  "OVERVIEW": "The Bragton series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in tidal basins and estuaries of major coastal rivers.  They formed in decomposed organic material overlying silty alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 3 to 6 degrees F.  Depth to the underlying silty material is 20 to 50 inches.  The overlying hemic and sapric material is moderately acid to neutral with the most acidic layer at the surface.\nThe surface tier (0 to 12 inches) consists of hemic material with a rubbed fiber content of 17 to 25 percent by volume.  It has over 50 percent organic matter.\nThe subsurface tier (12 to 36 inches) consists of hemic and sapric material.  The rubbed fiber content is 5 to 20 percent by volume.  Mineral soil material consisting of stratified fine sandy loam and silt loam, when present, occurs below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe bottom tier (36 to 52 inches) consists of stratified silt loam and fine sandy loam with 1 to 10 percent organic matter. When present, sapric material with a rubbed fiber content of 5 to 17 percent by volume may extend to a depth of 50 inches."

Bergsvik soils are organic soils with a sandy or sandy-skeletal mineral layer and lack the sapric organic layer.  Brallier soils lack the mineral soil layer, are very strongly acid and are typically drained.  Clatsop soils have a histic epipedon and are fine-silty.  Coquille, Nestucca, and Willanch soils are mineral soils.  In addition, Coquille and Nestucca soils are fine-silty and Willanch soils are coarse-loamy."
