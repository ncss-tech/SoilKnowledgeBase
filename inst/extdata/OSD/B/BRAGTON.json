  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is saturated with water throughout the year and is inundated by tidal action.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 3 to 6 degrees F.  Depth to the underlying silty material is 20 to 50 inches.  The overlying hemic and sapric material is moderately acid to neutral with the most acidic layer at the surface.\nThe surface tier (0 to 12 inches) consists of hemic material with a rubbed fiber content of 17 to 25 percent by volume.  It has over 50 percent organic matter.\nThe subsurface tier (12 to 36 inches) consists of hemic and sapric material.  The rubbed fiber content is 5 to 20 percent by volume.  Mineral soil material consisting of stratified fine sandy loam and silt loam, when present, occurs below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe bottom tier (36 to 52 inches) consists of stratified silt loam and fine sandy loam with 1 to 10 percent organic matter. When present, sapric material with a rubbed fiber content of 5 to 17 percent by volume may extend to a depth of 50 inches."

They formed in decomposed organic material over silty alluvium.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers.   The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 85 inches.  The frost free period is 165 to 240 days."

Bergsvik soils are organic soils with a sandy or sandy-skeletal mineral layer and lack the sapric organic layer.  Brallier soils lack the mineral soil layer, are very strongly acid and are typically drained.  Clatsop soils have a histic epipedon and are fine-silty.  Coquille, Nestucca, and Willanch soils are mineral soils.  In addition, Coquille and Nestucca soils are fine-silty and Willanch soils are coarse-loamy."
