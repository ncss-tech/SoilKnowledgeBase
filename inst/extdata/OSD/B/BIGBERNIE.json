  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arizo (CA), Dragonwash (CA), Jean (CA), Kokan (NM), and Pipecan (CA) series. All competing series are very deep and formed in alluvium. In addition, Arizo soils are slightly effervescent or more in some or all parts and may contain secondary calcium carbonates on undersides of rock fragments. Dragonwash soils include mainly gravel, with over half less than 5 millimeters in size. Jean soils contain less than 15 rock fragments in the upper part of the particle size control section, and are effervescent throughout the profile. Kokan soils have a climate typical of the Chihuahuan desert, which is moist in some parts for more than 20 days between July and September. Pipecan soils are usually dry, moist in some part in the winter and early spring and intermittingly moist at the soil surface only following occasional summer precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bigbernie soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from granitoid and gneiss. Elevation ranges from 1,050 to 1,450 meters (3,445 to 4,757 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers, and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C (63 to 68 degrees F). The frost-free season is 270 to 320 days."

All associated soils occur on adjacent mountain slopes, except Arizo soils which occur in drainageways, and are very deep. Goldenhills soils occur at elevations less than 1,050 meters and are deep to weathered granitoid, and have a hyperthermic soil temperature regime. Pinecity and Smithcanyon soils are shallow and sandy. Also Smithcanyon soils occur on adjacent north-facing slopes with an aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime."
