  "OVERVIEW": "The Buncelvoir series consists of very deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium.Buncelvoir soils are on tablelands and calderas.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the average annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.",
