  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Badaxe series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy loam material underlain by calcareous, loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
