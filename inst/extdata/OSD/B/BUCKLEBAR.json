Anway soils are less than 20 inches deep to the base of the Bt horizon.  Avenal, Bryman, Dutchflat, Garlock, Hi Vista and Neuralia soils are in the Mohave Desert and are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative during July to September.  Palomas soils have a cambic horizon above the argillic and have calcium carbonate accumulations below 50 inches.  No description available in the database for Contactmine."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 7 to 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 280 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 2 to 25 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons)\nSecondary carbonates - the zone from 25 to 60 inches  (Btk, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from pedon S59(61)NMex-7-7 (L.H. Gile and R. B. Grossman. 1979.  The Desert Project Soil Monograph. Document PB80-135304. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA.) support this classification.  The typical pedon is similar to and only a few feet away from the sampled pedon.\nRevised for the correlation of AZ661, 11/08, PDC\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
