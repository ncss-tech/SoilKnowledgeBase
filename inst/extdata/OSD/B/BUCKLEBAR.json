  "OVERVIEW": "The Bucklebar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Bucklebar soils are on fan terraces and coalescent fan piedmonts that have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006"
