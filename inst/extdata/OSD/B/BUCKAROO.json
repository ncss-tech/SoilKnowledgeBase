  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckaroo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Buckaroo soils are on fan piedmont remnants and lake terrace remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
