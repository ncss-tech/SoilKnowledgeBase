  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blackcan soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and basalt with minor amounts of quartzite and limestone. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,494 to 2,073 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

Kyler soils are on hills and mountains and are shallow to a lithic contact. Ursine soils are on fan remnants, are shallow to a duripan, and have carbonatic mineralogy."
