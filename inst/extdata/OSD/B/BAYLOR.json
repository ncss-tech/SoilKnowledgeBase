  "OVERVIEW": "The Baylor series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from igneous rocks.  Baylor soils are on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, terraces, ridge sides and Holocene fault scarps with slopes of 4 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 27 inches (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil on the Cox Ranch near the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nRecent evidence in Texas and Arizona suggests soils within this precipitation zone and MLRA are moist in some part of the mollic epipedon less than 90 days cumulative and therefore do not meet the moisture requirements for a mollic epipedon.  Alternative subgroups are Ustic Torriorthents or Ustic Haplocambids.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from the pedon at site 1 (in Gile, L.H.  1987. Late Holocene Displacement Along The Organ Mountains Fault In Southern New Mexico.  New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources Circular 196) support the classification.  Data from pedons at two additional sites in the same report also illustrate Baylor soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
