  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beavrock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps, and sloughs. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
