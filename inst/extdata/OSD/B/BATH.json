  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in). Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 66 to 97 cm (26 to 38 in). Depth to bedrock ranges from 102 (40 in) to 6 m (20 ft) or more. Rock fragments, primarily angular or subrounded sandstone or siltstone but in some pedons shale, range from 2 to 40 percent in individual horizons above the fragipan, and from 15 to 65 percent in the fragipan and C horizons. The soil ranges from very strongly to moderately acid in horizons above the fragipan, unless limed, from very strongly to slightly acid in the fragipan and from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Dry colors have value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. They are silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Undisturbed areas have thin dark A horizons and some have thin E horizons. Thin BA horizons may be present in some places. Some undisturbed pedons have a thin O horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. They are silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction commonly with more than 55 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, values of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3, with or without few faint to prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky or platy.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6 with redoximorphic features in most pedons. They range from silt loam to sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. They have platy, subangular blocky, or blocky structure within very coarse prisms or are massive within very coarse prisms. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe C or Cd horizon, where present, has color and fine-earth texture similar to the Bx horizon. Some pedons are slightly effervescent and calcareous."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Braceville, Broadalbin, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Rushford, Sodus, Swartswood, Wellsboro, and Wurtsboro series. Braceville soils have stratified sand and gravel in the lower part of the series control section. The Lackawanna and Wellsboro soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the fragipan. Broadalbin soils have coarse fragments dominated by granite and gneiss. Ira, Sodus, Swartswood and Wurtsboro commonly have less than 55 percent silt plus very fine sand in the particle size control section. Mardin soils have common or many redoximorphic features in the Bw horizons. Rushford soils have redox features in the Bw and a lacustrine substratum.\nBernardston, Broadbrook, Ludlow, Montauk, Nantucket, Newport, Paxton, Pittstown, Rainbow, Scituate, Wethersfield, and Woodbridge soils are in related families. The Bernardston, Broadbrook, Ludlow, Montauk, Nantucket, Newport, Paxton, Pittstown, Rainbow, Scituate, Wethersfield, and Woodbridge soils all lack a fragipan. Wethersfield soils have hues of 5YR or redder throughout the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bath soils are gently sloping to steep soils on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed in loamy till derived largely from gray and brown siltstone, sandstone and shale. The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual precipitation commonly ranges from 795 to 1725 mm (31 to 68 in) but the range includes as high as 1790 mm (70 in) in some places; mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F). The frost-free season ranges from 105 to 180 days. Elevation typically ranges from 100 to 670 m ( 328 to 2,198 ft) but the range includes as high as 750 m (2460 ft) in some places."
