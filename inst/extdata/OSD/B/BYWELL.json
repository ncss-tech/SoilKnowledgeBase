  "OVERVIEW": "The Bywell series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic rocks.  Bywell soils are on stream terraces, and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.",
