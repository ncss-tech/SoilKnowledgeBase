Chrome soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Edenton and and Wynn soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Eldean soils average more than 30 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and have more than 55 percent sand there (mostly medium and coarse). Lamoille soils have rock fragments throughout the series control section and do not have stratification in the lower part of the series control section. Newnata soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Paintcreek soils do not have carbonates in the series control section; are more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick to the base of the argillic horizon; and have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Upshur soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and do not have stratification in the lower part of the series control section. Woodsfield soils have sloa greater than 102 cm (40 inches) deep and do not have free carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Zion soils have bedrock within depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) from the surface."

Manawa soils are on lower positions in the landscape and are somewhat poorly drained.  Montello soils formed under prairie grasses and have mollic epipedons.  Oshkosh soils are in glacial lake basins, but have finer textured sola."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Formerly these soils were included with the Oshkosh soils which are in a very-fine family.\n7/04 - A total of 25,189 acres of Briggsville have been correlated in 9 soil surveys in Wisconsin.  The 720 acres correlated in Columbia County appear to be formed in clayey till (gravel in typical pedon and soils in Adams County, just 1.5 miles from the Columbia Co. typical pedon site, were correlated as Kewaunee which is clayey till). These acres will probably be correlated to clayey till in an update.\n7/04 - Of the 9 counties where Briggsville is correlated, only one (Calumet-Manitowoc with 3245 acres) has redox features in the typical pedon.  Therefore, this revision redefines Briggsville as well drained only. A new typical pedon is used to reflect the plowed condition of most of the acreage and because there are discrepancies between the location given for the old typical pedon in the published survey and the location given in the OSD.  The moderately well drained acres need to be correlated to another (new?) series (Oxyaquic Hapludalf) when those areas are updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon -  0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap ); argillic horizon -  18 to 99 cm (7 to 39 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5 ).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
