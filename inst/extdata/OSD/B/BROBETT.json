  "OVERVIEW": "The Brobett series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in mixed alluvium from rhyolite and quartzite, with local influences of tuff and sandstone.  Brobett soils are on dissected bajadas and have slopes ranging from 3 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about ll inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages l2 to l7 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F.  The moisture control section is usually dry, but is moist in some part 25 to 35 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 4l degrees F.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value 4 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It commonly is gravelly loam and less commonly very gravelly loam.  Clay films range from few to common.  It is slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe Bqk horizon has a value 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It commonly is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bqkm horizon is a continuous duripan which is weakly cemented or strongly cemented.  It has value of 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
