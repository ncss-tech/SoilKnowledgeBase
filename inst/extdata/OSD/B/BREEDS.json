  "OVERVIEW": "The Breeds series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that are deep to shale on strath terraces.  These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

Depth to a paralithic contact in shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The particle size control section averages between 27 and 35 percent clay.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap, A, and/or AB horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe middle part of the series control section (BA, Bt, Btg, 2Bt, and/or 2BC horizon) has hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Hue of 5Y is in the lower subhorizons in some pedons.  Clay content of individual subhorizons ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid in the upper part to slightly alkaline in the lower part.  Redox concentrations are present, commonly as iron and manganese masses lining root channels and pores.\nWhere present, the 2Bt and/or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is stratified clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Content of rocks fragments is less than 15 percent.\nThe lower part of the series control section to a depth of 56 inches (3Cr horizon) is weathered shale bedrock."
