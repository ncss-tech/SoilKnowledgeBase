Aycock, Bewleyville, Curtistown and Mountview soils do not have a bisequal clay distribution.  In addition, Bewleyville, Curtistown, and Mountview soils have lower B and 2B horizons that are dominanted by hues of 5YR and 2.5YR and contain no plinthite.  Alamance soils have a 20 percent clay decrease within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Bowie soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Felker and Sawyer soils have chroma 2 mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Ruston and Warnock soils are in a fine-loamy particle size class."

Adaton soils, which occur on upland flats and depressional areas, have higher base saturation and are poorly drained.  Sacul soils, which occur on more dissected landscapes, have mixed mineralogy, chroma 2 mottles in the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon and are in a clayey particle size class.  Savannah soils, which occur on similar landscapes contain a fragipan and are in a fine-loamy particle size class."
