  "OVERVIEW": "The Bobs series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone or dolomite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash. Bobs soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
