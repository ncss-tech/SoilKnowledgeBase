The soils formed from colluvium over calcareous quartzite\nresiduum.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of\nwhich falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air\ntemperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90\ndays."

Winridge soils\nare moderately deep and have more than 35 percent clay in the control\nsection.  Povey soils occur on the same landscape.  Elksel, Furshur,\nPeevywell, and Winridge soils occur on mountain sides formed from\ntertiary volcanics.  Prudy soils occur on similiar landscapes on north\nand east-facing slopes."
