  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackspot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that\nformed in mixed colluvium over calcareous quartzite residuum.\nBlackspot soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 30 to 60\npercent.  Permeability is moderately.  The average annual precipitation\nis about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 41\ndegrees F.",

Peevywell soils are\nmoderately deep to a duripan and have more than 35 percent clay in the\ncontrol section.  Prudy soils are deep to a duripan.  Winridge soils\nare moderately deep and have more than 35 percent clay in the control\nsection.  Povey soils occur on the same landscape.  Elksel, Furshur,\nPeevywell, and Winridge soils occur on mountain sides formed from\ntertiary volcanics.  Prudy soils occur on similiar landscapes on north\nand east-facing slopes."
