  "OVERVIEW": "The Brusher series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in highly weathered colluvium, residuum, and valley fill from granitic or porphyritic volcanic rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountain footslopes and moisture receptive toeslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the solum is greater than 40 inches.  The upper 14 to 26 inches of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.   The lower part of the particle-size control section averages 18 to 34 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent, mostly fine, pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  This horizon is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, or ashy very fine sandy loam.  This horizon is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe 2E horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is loam or sandy loam and may be gravelly.  This horizon is 0 to 20 percent pebbles.  Some pedons lack an E horizon.\nThe B part of the 2B/E and 2E/B horizons has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  The E part has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Both are loam or sandy loam and may be gravelly.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky or platy structure.  This horizon is 0 to 25 percent pebbles.  Some pedons lack a 2B/E and/or a 2E/B horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is clay loam, loam, or sandy loam and may be gravelly.  It has weak, moderate, or strong, medium or coarse, subangular blocky, angular blocky, or platy structure.  This horizon is 0 to 30 percent pebbles.  Some pedons have a BCt or BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry or moist.  It is coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand and may be gravelly.  This horizon is 5 to 30 percent pebbles.  In some pedons its upper boundary is deeper than 60 inches."
