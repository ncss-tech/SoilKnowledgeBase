  "OVERVIEW": "The Britton series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from diatomite or water-laid tuff.  Britton soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from early July to early November (120-130 days) and is moist in all parts from mid November to mid-May; The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from early March to late December (300 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid-April to mid-November; Xeric moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature - 48 to 50 degrees F.\nDepth to base of cambic horizon - 10 to 20 inches.\nDepth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered and fractured diatomite or water-laid tuff.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 45 percent; Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mainly pebbles.\nReaction - Moderately acid to strongly acid and acidity increases with depth.\nOther features - Mineralogy is mixed with small amounts of halloysitic and montmorillonitic clays.  The 15 bar water to clay ratio ranges from 0.61 to 0.78.  NaF pH is 8.4 to 7.9 and decreases with depth. Base saturation by ammonium acetate ranges from 70 to 90 percent and increases with depth.  The CEC to clay ratio ranges from 0.64 to 0.87.  Volcanic glass content ranges from 30 to 50 percent in the A horizon and the Bw1 horizon, but the fine-earth fraction has less than 30 percent particles that are coarse silt through very coarse sand in size.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/1, or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, or 3/3.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam with 25 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel. Organic matter content ranges from 3 to 7 percent.\nThe Bw horizon color is 10YR 6/2, 7/2 or 8/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  The clay content is 30 to 40 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part and 35 to 40 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part. Organic matter content ranges from 1 to 2 percent in the upper part and .5 to 1 percent in the lower part."
