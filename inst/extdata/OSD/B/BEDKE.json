  "OVERVIEW": "The Bedke series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from loess and mixed alluvium.  Bedke soils are on high terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
