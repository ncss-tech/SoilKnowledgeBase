  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brimstone series consists of deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits that are high in exchangeable sodium of late Pleistocene age.  These soils are on broad flats or depressions. Slopes ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1600 mm 63 (in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",
