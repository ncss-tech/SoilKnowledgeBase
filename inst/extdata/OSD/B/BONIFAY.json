  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed. Ironstone pebbles, 2 to 15 mm in size, range from 0 to 5 percent, by volume. Depth to the plinthic horizon ranges from 42 to 65 inches. Some horizons contain up to 25 percent plinthite, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6. Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic concentrations in shades of yellow and brown range from none to common. Spherical bodies and vertical streaks of uncoated sand grains with hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, chroma of 1 or 2, or neutral with value of 8 range from none to common. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btv horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8; or it has no dominant color and is variegated in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray range from few to many. Clay content of the upper 20 inches ranges from 15 to 35 percent but is most commonly 15 to 30 percent. Silt content is less than 20 percent. Texture ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bonifay soils are on ridges and side slopes in the Southern Coastal Plain. They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The climate is humid temperate. The average annual air temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Albany, Blanton, Dothan, Foxworth, Fuquay, Lakeland, Leefield, Lucy, Meldrim, Ocilla, Tifton, Troup, Wadley and Wagram series.  Albany, Blanton, Troup, and Wadley soils have less than 5 percent plinthite in the Bt horizons. In addition, Albany soils are somewhat poorly drained, Blanton soils are somewhat excessively drained to moderately well drained, Meldrim soils are moderately well drained and Troup soils are somewhat excessively drained and have a kandic horizon. Dothan and Tifton soils have A and E horizons less than 20 inches thick and are kandic.  In addition, Tifton soils contain more than 5 percent ironstone pebbles in the A horizon and the upper part of the Bt horizon. Fuquay, Leefield, Lucy, Ocilla, and Wagram soils have A and E horizons 20 to 40 inches thick. In addition, Fuquay, Lucy, and Wagram soils are kandic, while Lucy soils, the somewhat poorly drained Leefield and Ocilla soils, and Wagram soils lack plinthite in the Bt horizon. Foxworth and Lakeland soils lack a Bt horizon within depth of 80 inches."
