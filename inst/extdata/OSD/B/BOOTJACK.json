  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bootjack soils are nearly level on terraces, outwash plains, and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,500 feet. The soil formed in fine textured alluvium in the upper part and gravelly alluvium in the lower part, predominantly from welded rhyolitic tuff, obsidian and diatomaceous sources. The average annual precipitation is about 20 to 30 inches, mostly as snowfall. The average annual air temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."

Henryslake soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Sawtelpeak soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Both Henryslake and Sawtelpeak soils have mollic epipedons and occur on similar landscapes."
