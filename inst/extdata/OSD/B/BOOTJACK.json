  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bootjack series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and very rapid below. They are on terraces, outwash plains, and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
