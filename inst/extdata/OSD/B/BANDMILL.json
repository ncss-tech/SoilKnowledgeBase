  "OVERVIEW": "The Bandmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over basalt residuum with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on hills and structural benches of lava plateaus.  Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
