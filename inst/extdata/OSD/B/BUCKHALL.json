  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness, ranges from 25 to more than 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The C horizon is saprolite from granite gneiss or schist commonly many feet thick. Rock fragments of angular vein quartz gravel up to 3 inches range from 0 to 15 percent. Some pedons have up to 5 percent angular cobbles up to 10 inches in diameter. This soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe thin A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 0 through 3. It is loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam. The Ap horizon, where present, includes clay and sandy clay loam in eroded areas, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 4 or 6.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8. It is clay loam or clay. Some pedons have a BC horizon which has similar colors as the Bt horizon. It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay. Mottles in shades of brown, red, yellow and white are in the lower horizon.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown and white. Texture is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam."

Boden, soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Braddock soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches deep to saprolite. Buffstat, Totier, and Warminster soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Casville, Christian, Danripple, Flagspring, Goresville, Howell, Muse, Unison, and Yellowbottom soils have no saprolite layer within 60 inches. Clifton soils formed in residuum from acid rocks high in ferromagnesium minerals and have Bt horizons with hue centered on 2.5YR. Clover soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic age materials. Groseclose soils have more than 30 percent parachanners in the lower part of the series control section. Mount Rush, Sequoia, and Spears Mountain soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact."

These soils developed in residuum that weathered from granite, gneiss and schist. Mean\nannual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Buckhall series has previously been included in Appling and Wedowee series, both of which are in thermic\ntemperature zones and have kaolinitic mineralogy.\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data from Prince William County, Virginia. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. In addition, the typical pedon description and the Competing Series section were revised. Other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 1/83--DLK, JHE, DDR\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
