The C horizon is saprolite from granite gneiss or schist commonly many feet thick. Rock fragments of angular vein quartz gravel up to 3 inches range from 0 to 15 percent. Some pedons have up to 5 percent angular cobbles up to 10 inches in diameter. This soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe thin A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 0 through 3. It is loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam. The Ap horizon, where present, includes clay and sandy clay loam in eroded areas, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 4 or 6.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 3 through 6.

Some pedons have a BC horizon which has similar colors as the Bt horizon. It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay. Mottles in shades of brown, red, yellow and white are in the lower horizon.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown and white.

Boden, soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Braddock soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches deep to saprolite. Buffstat, Totier, and Warminster soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Casville, Christian, Danripple, Flagspring, Goresville, Howell, Muse, Unison, and Yellowbottom soils have no saprolite layer within 60 inches. Clifton soils formed in residuum from acid rocks high in ferromagnesium minerals and have Bt horizons with hue centered on 2.5YR. Clover soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic age materials. Groseclose soils have more than 30 percent parachanners in the lower part of the series control section. Mount Rush, Sequoia, and Spears Mountain soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact."

The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data from Prince William County, Virginia. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. In addition, the typical pedon description and the Competing Series section were revised. Other sections on the OSD were not revised.\n2/2022 revision: Oi had 2 to 0 inch depths, corrected to be 0 to 2 in horizon depths then added 2 inches to all horizon depths throughout the typical pedon.
