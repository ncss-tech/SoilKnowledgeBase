  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Buddtown soils were previously mapped in New Jersey as Nixonton soils. Nixonton soils are in a thermic temperature regime and are fine-silty. Particle-size data from several pedons within 3 counties in New Jersey supports a coarse-loamy family. Buddtown soils occur adjacent to landforms and soils with higher glauconite content, and typically contain few glauconite pellets mixed with the dominantly reworked marine materials from which the soils formed. Unconforming materials and the presence of a lithological discontinuity (2C horizon) are not a series requirement. Pedons that do not have unconforming 2C materials are not significantly different in use and management.\nDiagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 9 to 34 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nAquic conditions--the zone from 26 to 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nLithologic discontinuity--Contrasting sand sizes at depth of 34 inches (2C1, 2C2, 2C3, and 2C4 horizons)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nReference particle-size data is available from the project soil survey staff, Hammonton, New Jersey.\nDatabase Information:\nOSD Data Mapunit ID: To be developed\nRepresentative Data Mapunit ID: 407455\nOSD User Pedon ID: Buddtown-OSD\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
