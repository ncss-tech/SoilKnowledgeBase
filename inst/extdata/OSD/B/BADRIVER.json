  "OVERVIEW": "The Badriver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in clayey till.

Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Many areas which were formerly cropland are now idle and reverting to natural vegetation.  The native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees species are red maple, balsam fir, quaking aspen, paper birch, and willow.  Common understory species are speckled alder, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."
