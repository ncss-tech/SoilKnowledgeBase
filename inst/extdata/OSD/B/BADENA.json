Badenaugh soils have slightly acid or neutral soil reaction and do not have sandy-skeletal material within a depth of 100 cm. Eaglerock, Trid, and Searvar soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, and Searles soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Tristan soils are deep to lithic contacts. Lemm soils average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Leviathan soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 100 to 178 cm. Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, and Shroe soils  average less than 60  percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Nosrac soils have 36 to 50 cm thick mollic epipedons, and hue of 5Y in lower subhorizons. Ashue,Oest, Shawmount, Shree, and Shroe soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section. Shawmount soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. Shree soils do not contain sandy textures in the C horizon. Shroe soils have upper sub-horizons within the particle-size control section that average 35 to 45 percent clay. Tollgate soils have an argillic horizon with a base depth greater than 36 inches."
