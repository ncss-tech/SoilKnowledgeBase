Depth to paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The 0 to 38 inch (or paralithic contact) particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of less than 12.0 percent for air dried samples, and field estimate 5 to 10 percent clay.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section averages 40 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is very gravelly fine sandy loam, very cobbly fine sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam."

Climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, moist winters, the average January temperature is 24 degrees F, the average July temperature is 68 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."
