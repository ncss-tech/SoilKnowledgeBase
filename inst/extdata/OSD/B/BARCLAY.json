The series was previously in Aquic Dystrochrepts, but having redoximorphic features beginning at 7 inches, dominant chroma of 2 at 18 inches, and being somewhat poorly drained are soil properties that meet the requirements for Aeric Endoaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil properties recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from 7 to 57 inches (Bw, Bg1, Bg2, and BCg horizons)"
