  "REVDATE": "10/2012",
  "STATES": "IA,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bauer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loamy or silty sediments over residuum from brown and gray acid shale.  These soils are on convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams.  Slope ranges from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 835 millimeters.",

The gray colors in the B and C horizons are inherited from the shale and were not considered in the classification of this soil.\nThe extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  Drainage class is difficult to assess because of the color inherited from the shale.\nX-ray diffraction data indicates that kaolinite and illite are the dominant minerals and so the mineralogy class is considered mixed. 2/10/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
