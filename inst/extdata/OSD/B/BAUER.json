The gray colors in the B and C horizons are inherited from the shale and were not considered in the classification of this soil.\nThe extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  Drainage class is difficult to assess because of the color inherited from the shale.\nX-ray diffraction data indicates that kaolinite and illite are the dominant minerals and so the mineralogy class is considered mixed. 2/10/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
