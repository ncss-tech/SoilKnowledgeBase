  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigmon series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in loamy residuum and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Bigmon soils are on mesa backslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
