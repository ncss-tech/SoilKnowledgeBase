  "OVERVIEW": "The Borky series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
