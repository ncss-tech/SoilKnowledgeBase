    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches and it extends into or through the Bw horizon.  The control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is mottled within the lower part.  It typically is loam or clay loam and ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 6 or 7 and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is loam or clay loam but is silt loam, or light silty clay loam in some pedons.  It has common to many accumulations of carbonate.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 6 or 7 and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loam or clay loam and in some pedons it is stratified loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam, with lenses 1 to 10 inches thick of clay loam, silty clay loam, or loamy sand.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The C horizon has few to many, distinct or prominent mottles.  It typically has few to many accumulations of carbonate.  Visible gypsum is common in the lower part."

Table Mountain soils are dry more than 1/2 the time the soil temperature is 41 degrees F. or higher. Whiskey soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bonilla soils are nearly level to gently sloping in drainageways, swales, flats and foot slopes of the glacial till plains. Surfaces are plane to slightly concave and slope gradients typically are 2 percent or less, but range from 0 to 6 percent. Bonilla soils formed in loam or clay loam glacial till.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 135 to 165 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Blendon, Clarno, Crossplain, Davison, Ethan, Hand, Henkin, Prosper, and Tetonka soils. Blendon soils are on similar landscapes and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Clarno, Ethan, Hand, and Henkin soils are on higher convex slopes.  Clarno, Ethan, Hand, and Henkin soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. In addition, Ethan soils have carbonates at or near the surface and Henkin soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Crossplain and Tetonka soils are in swales and depressions, have a fine textured series control section, and are more poorly drained.  Davison soils are on slight rises near swales or depressions and have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface.  Prosper soils have an argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes as the Bonilla soils."
