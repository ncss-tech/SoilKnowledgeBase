  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonilla series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial till in drainageways and swales of the uplands. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow or moderate in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Surfaces are plane to slightly concave and slope gradients typically are 2 percent or less, but range from 0 to 6 percent. Bonilla soils formed in loam or clay loam glacial till.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 135 to 165 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

Blendon soils are on similar landscapes and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Clarno, Ethan, Hand, and Henkin soils are on higher convex slopes.  Clarno, Ethan, Hand, and Henkin soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. In addition, Ethan soils have carbonates at or near the surface and Henkin soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Crossplain and Tetonka soils are in swales and depressions, have a fine textured series control section, and are more poorly drained.  Davison soils are on slight rises near swales or depressions and have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface.  Prosper soils have an argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes as the Bonilla soils."
