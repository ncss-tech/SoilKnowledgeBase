  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 7 to 20 inches. The soil between the depths of 6 to 18 inches or to the paralithic contact usually becomes moist in some parts in November or early December and remains moist until May. Mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 61 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and winter soil temperature is 15 degrees to 25 degrees F.  Organic matter is more than one percent throughout the solum. The profile is heavy sandy loam, heavy fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay.  Pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral. Base saturation is more than 75 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color of 10YR 6/3; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bonnydoon soils are on uplands and have gradients of 5 to 85 percent. They formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale. Elevations are 50 to 2,100 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal having warm, dry, but foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. Average January temperature is 48 degrees F.; average July temperature is 68 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 60 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 240 to 290 days."
