  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluelick series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum from cherty limestone. Permeability is moderately slow. These soils are on uplands and slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",
