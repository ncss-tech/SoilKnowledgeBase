  "OVERVIEW": "The Bechtel series consists of deep, well drained soils on foothills. They formed in material weathered from siltite of the Libby, Wallace and Prichard formations and fine grained quartzites of the Striped Peak formation of the Belt supergroup with a mixed mantle of loess and volcanic ash. Permeability is moderately slow. Slope ranges from 20 to 40 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F and average annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",
