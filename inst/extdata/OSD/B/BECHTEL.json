    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bechtel soils are on south, east, and west facing convex foothills. Slopes range from 20 to 40 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from siltite of the Libby, Wallace and Prichard formations and fine grained quartzites of the Striped Peak formation of the Belt supergroup with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 2,800 to 3,500 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches, and frost-free season is from 90 to 120 days."
