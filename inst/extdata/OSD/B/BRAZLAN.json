  "OVERVIEW": "The Brazlan series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils formed in glacial till mixed with loess and volcanic ash over basalt.  They are on glaciated plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section contains 35 to 55 percent rock fragments. Depth to duripan is 20 to 36 inches and basalt bedrock is at 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. The chroma is 1 to 3 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. Texture is very cobbly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR. The value is 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. The chroma is 1 to 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist. Texture is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam. The apparent field clay content is 5 to 10 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bqm horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist or dry. It is weakly or moderately cemented. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam with 10 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones. It is slightly to moderately alkaline."
