These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 2 to 15 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, and 5 to 14 percent apparent field textured clay content.  The particle-size control section contains 35 to 55 percent rock fragments. Depth to duripan is 20 to 36 inches and basalt bedrock is at 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. The chroma is 1 to 3 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. Texture is very cobbly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR. The value is 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. The chroma is 1 to 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist. Texture is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam. The apparent field clay content is 5 to 10 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bqm horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist or dry. It is weakly or moderately cemented. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam with 10 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones. It is slightly to moderately alkaline."
