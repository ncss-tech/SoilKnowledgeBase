  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellingham series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess, alluvium, and lacustrine sediments.  These soils are in depressions.  Slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  It is assumed the solum to a depth of 40 inches has a linear extensibility of 2 to 3 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Some pedons have strong brown to dark brown redox concentrations. This horizon has moderate or strong granular or angular blocky structure.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5BG, or 5GY, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It has few to many fine and medium dark reddish brown, yellowish red, strong brown, yellowish brown, or dark yellowish brown redox concentrations.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  This horizon has weak or moderate prismatic or angular blocky structure.  It has weak or distinct pressure faces on some peds.  It is moderately acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5B, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has yellowish red or strong brown redox concentrations.  This horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay  with some pedons having thin layers of sandy loam or silt loam.  It is moderately acid through moderately alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alderwood, Clallam, Elwha, Everett, Kitsap, Labounty, McKenna, Sadie, Skipopa, and Whatcom soils.  All of these soils lack an aquic moisture regime except Labounty and McKenna soils.  Also, Alderwood soils have a cemented layer. Clallam, Elwha, McKenna, and Sadie soils have a densic contact with dense very compact glacial till at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Everett soils are sandy-skeletal.  Kitsap soils are fine-silty. Labounty soils are fine-loamy.  Skipopa soils have an argillic horizon with a silt loam surface mantle that qualifies as aquandic. Whatcom soils are fine-loamy."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features are:  Soil is not considered a vertic intergrade based on similar soil data from lab pedon #81P0515.  Characterization data are available; sample numbers S77WA-9-3, S81WA-073-3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon and a gleyed cambic horizon from 5 to 60 inches.\nIn the past this series has been interpreted as having an apparent or a perched water table.  The series is considered to have Endo saturation.  For areas mapped with perched water tables and a moist or dry zone is present below the layer perching the water, a new series will need to be proposed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
