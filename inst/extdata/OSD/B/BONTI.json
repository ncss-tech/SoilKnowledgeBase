  "REVDATE": "12/2013",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonti series consists of moderately deep to sandstone, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and claystone of Pennsylvanian age. These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on summits and shoulders of ridges on hills.  Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
