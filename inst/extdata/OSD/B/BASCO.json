Sandstone is the Jordan formation and some areas have thin strata of finer texture in the bedrock.\nThe range in characteristics of the A horizon may include pedons that have a Mollic epipedon; further investigation may be necessary to determine taxonomic placement of the Basco soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
