Slopes commonly are 1 to 5 percent but range from 1 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from basalt that is overlain by wind blown deposits from sandstone and shale.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 65 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 80 degrees to 84 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 195 days."

Based on the material having been altered.  The soil is not considered buried, and is classified from the surface.\nThe classification was changed from Petrocalcic Paleargids to Argic Petrocalcids in 12/94.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015.
