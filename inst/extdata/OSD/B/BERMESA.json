  "OVERVIEW": "The Bermesa series consists of moderately deep over indurated carbonate hardpan, well drained soils that formed in residuum dominantly from basalt that is overlain by wind blown deposits from sandstone and shale.  The Bermesa soils are on desert slopes made by lava flows.  Slopes ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

Based on the material having been altered.  The soil is not considered buried, and is classified from the surface.\nThe classification was changed from Petrocalcic Paleargids to Argic Petrocalcids in 12/94.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015.
