  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are moist in some part of the soil above depth of 12 inches for at least half the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. but are dry between depths of 4 and 20 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  Depth to basalt bedrock is 12 to 20 inches.  The solum has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  The particle-size control section has 18 to 30 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  The upper 4 to 6 inches is estimated to have 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or very stony loam.   It has 10 to 30 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 35 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist dry. It is loam or clay loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 10 to 60 percent gravel, 10 to 55 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones."

Aldax soils average less than 18 percent clay and are usually dry.  Bakeoven soils are 4 to 10 inches deep to bedrock and are usually dry.  Couleedam soils average less than 18 percent clay and are usually dry (aridic).  Johntom soils are 5 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Lickskillet soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days.  Limekiln soils have a calcic horizon at a depth of 7 to 12 inches.  Plaskett soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 58 degrees F. and average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Rockly soils are 4 to 12 inches deep to bedrock.  Venator soils are dominated by channery rock fragments throughout the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bodell soils are on moderately steep to very steep generally south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Elevations are 200 to 3600 feet. These soils formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash, and colluvium weathered from basalt over basalt bedrock. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 51egrees F., the mean winter temperature is about 31 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 69 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 140 days."
