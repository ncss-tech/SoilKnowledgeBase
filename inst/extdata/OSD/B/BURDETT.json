    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 11 to 28 inches. The soil ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline in the solum and slightly acid through moderately alkaline in the substratum. Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 72 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent above the lithologic discontinuity and 10 to 35 percent below.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine granular or subangular blocky.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 3 or 4 with 2 chroma faces of peds. Redoximorphic features of iron accumulations and/or depletions are present. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine through coarse subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon similar to the BE horizon except lack 2 chroma faces of peds.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hues of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Structure is weak to moderate, platy to weak, coarse subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable to friable. It has common or many, medium or coarse, faint or distinct redoximorphic features.\nSome pedons have a B and E horizon. It has hues of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3 on faces of peds and hues of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4 in interiors of peds. It has common or many, medium or coarse and faint or distinct redoximorphic features consisting of both areas of iron depletions and soft iron masses. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Structure is moderate thick platy to weak coarse subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable to firm.\nSome pedons have a 2B/E horizon with properties similar to their respective horizons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Redoximorphic features are evident. Areas of iron/clay depletions are common as are soft iron masses. Ped coats have chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam, or silty clay loam with clay content ranging from 28 to 35 percent. Structure is weak or moderate, prismatic or subangular blocky in the upper part and weak or moderate, platy, blocky or prismatic in the lower part. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nSome pedons have a 2BC with properties similar to the 2Bt and 2C.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, thin through thick platy, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Redoximorphic features are common and are similar to those in the 2Bt horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Angola, Appleton, Ayrshire, Crawleyville, Darien, Digby, Great Piece (T), Jimtown, Mitiwanga, Mongle, Ovid, Shadeland, Sleeth and Whitaker series are members of the same family. Angola, Mitinwanga and Shadeland soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches or less. Ayrshire, Crawleyville, Sleeth, and Whitaker soils have thicker sola. Digby, Great Piece (T), and Jimtown soils are underlain with outwash deposits. Appleton, Darien, and Ovid soils lack a lithologic discontinuity and Darien and Ovid soils have a higher clay content in the subsoil. Mongle soils are subject to flooding and are formed in alluvium.\nThe Aubbeenaubbee(IN), Crosier(IN), Grantfork(IL), Haskins(OH), Luther(IA), Pinicon(IA), and Shebeon(MI) are members in related families. Aubbeenaubbee, Crosier, Grantfork, Haskins, and Shebeon soils have dense till. Luther and Pinicon soils have a thicker sola and Pinicon soils lack the shale fragments in the sola. The Atherton, Fremont, Greene, Kendaia and Orpark soils are members of related families. All of these soils lack an argillic horizon."

The soils formed in silty mantles that overlie till that is strongly influenced by shale. The climate is humid and cool. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 28 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.; and the mean annual frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days.
