  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellpine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks. Bellpine soils are on smooth convex foothills. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer between depths of 4 and 12 inches within MLRA 2 but ranges to 90 days in MLRA 5. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 55 degrees F. Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Coarse fragments of sedimentary paragravel range from few to 50 percent with a weighted average of less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section, the amount increasing with increasing depth. Up to 5 percent hard rock fragments commonly occur at the horizon boundary of the BA and Bt1 horizons. The particle-size control section has 40 to 55 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. In some pedons this horizon is replaced with an AB horizon. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent paragravel in the upper part and 5 to 50 percent paragravel in the lower part. Texture is silty clay or clay with 40 to 55 percent clay. Clay films range from common faint to common or many distinct. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a thin BC horizon above the paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bellpine soils occur in the smooth convex foothills adjacent to the Willamette Valley terraces and in southwest Oregon. Elevations are 300 to 3,000 feet. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. The winters are warm and wet and the summers are hot and dry. The average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The frost-free period is 160 to 235 days."

Dupee soils have aquic conditions and chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 20 to 30 inches and occur on footslopes and in depressions on hills. Jory soils have bedrock at depths greater than 60 inches and occur on concave or linear hills. Rickreall soils have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches and occur on ridges, shoulder slopes and other convex parts of the hillslope. Willakenzie soils are fine-loamy and occur at lower elevations. Nekia soils occur over lithic volcanic bedrock."
