  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry.  It is gravelly or cobbly ashy sandy loam with 10 to 20 gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly loamy sand with 25 to 45 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 3C horizon is a relatively thin horizon and is absent in some pedons.  It has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite or gneiss with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 6,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F, average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
