  "REVDATE": "11/85",
  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Burwell series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy colluvium or alluvium over interbedded shale and sandstone.  The shale and sandstone is of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to gently sloping circular or oblong mounds of uplands in the Cherokee Prairies, Arkansas Valley and Ridges, and the Ouachita Mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 47 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

Soils in similar families the Armistead, Choteau, Dennis, Falkner, Muskogee, Nesbitt, Newtonia, Okemah, Reelfoot, Tippah and Vian series.  Armistead and Reelfoot soils decrease in clay content within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Choteau, Dennis, and Okemah soils have fine control sections.  Falkner, Nesbitt, and Vian soils lack mollic epipedons and have siliceous mineralogy.  Muskogee and Tippah soils lack mollic epipedons.  Newtonia soils lack wetness mottles within the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."
