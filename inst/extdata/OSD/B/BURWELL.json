  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Depth to clay is more than 44 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is medium acid or strongly acid.  The thickness of the combined A and E horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Most pedons have few fine gray and brown mottles.  Texture and reaction is the same as the A horizon.\nSome pedons have BA horizons that range from 4 to 13 inches thick.  It has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Most pedons have few to common, fine to coarse gray, red or brown mottles.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly acid.  Fragments of sandstone from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe Bt2 horizon ranges in hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Mottles are similar to those in the Bt1 horizon.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to medium acid.  Fragments of sandstone from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 10 percent by volume.\nThe Bt3 horizon is coarsely mottled in red, gray or brown.  Texture is clay loam, clay, gravelly clay loam, and gravelly clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to medium acid.  Fragments of sandstone or shale from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 20 percent by volume."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Soils in similar families the Armistead, Choteau, Dennis, Falkner, Muskogee, Nesbitt, Newtonia, Okemah, Reelfoot, Tippah and Vian series.  Armistead and Reelfoot soils decrease in clay content within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Choteau, Dennis, and Okemah soils have fine control sections.  Falkner, Nesbitt, and Vian soils lack mollic epipedons and have siliceous mineralogy.  Muskogee and Tippah soils lack mollic epipedons.  Newtonia soils lack wetness mottles within the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burwell soils are on circular or oblong mounds of uplands that are 2 to 5 feet high and 20 to 100 feet in diameter.  The top of the mound is very gently sloping and the sideslope is very gently sloping or gently sloping.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 54 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64."
