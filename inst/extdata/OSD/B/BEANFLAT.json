  "OVERVIEW": "The Beanflat series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Beanflat soils are on broad alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
