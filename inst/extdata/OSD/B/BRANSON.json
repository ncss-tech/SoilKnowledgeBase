  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to consolidated bedrock is over 80 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon (lithologic discontinuity) is 15 to 38 inches. Chert gravel content in the upper 40 inches ranges from 0 to 5 percent and from 0 to 25 percent below 40 inches. Clay content of the particle-size control section averages from 18 to 35 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has color value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  If the value is 3 and chroma 2 or 3, the surface thickness is less than 6 inches.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid, but is higher where limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their cherty analogues.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid."

Covedale soils formed in black, fissile shale and have rock fragments of black fissile shale, sandstone, ironstone, and siltstone. Grandgulf soils are deeper than 30 inches to the 2Bt horizon (lithologic discontinuity)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Branson soils are on broad uplands, stream terraces, basins, and foot slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  They formed in silty alluvium or a thin mantle of loess and the underlying colluvium or residuum from limestone, dolomite, cherty limestone or cherty dolomite. The mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 38 to 42 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  When on terraces and foot slopes, associated soils include the Ashton, Claiborne, Clarksville, Noark and Secesh soils.  Ashton and Secesh soils have higher base saturation and are on lower stream terraces.  Claiborne soils have a fine-loamy control section and are on similar positions.  Clarksville and Noark soils have more coarse fragments throughout and are on steep slopes above the Branson soils.  When on uplands, these are the Creldon, Pembroke, Splitlimb, and Tonti soils.  Creldon and Pembroke soils have dark surface horizons and are on similar positions.  Creldon soils also have a fragipan. Splitlimb soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in depressions. Tonti soils have a fragipan and are on similar positions."
