Blue Earth is being restricted to ponded basins and lake beds of the Holocene epoch.\nProblems remain in the classification of these series because no taxon has been defined in Soil Taxonomy that adequately accommodates soils that have formed entirely in coprogenous earth.\nA firm till substratum phase with a moist bulk density range from 1.65 to 1.75 g/cc is recognized in MLRA 103 on the Coteau Slope (bench) physiographic area.\nCation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--refer to MAES Central File Code No. 1135 for results of some laboratory analysis of a representative pedon of this series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
