The clay is dominantly smecitite with a CEC of 50 to 70 millequivalents per 100 grams of carbonate-free clay.  Organic matter averages 2 percent in the upper 15 inches.  The soils are usually dry when not frozen unless they are irrigated.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.  It is neutral.  A 3 to 5 inch thick clay loam A1 horizon that has value of 6 dry and 4 moistis in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and chroma of 2 or 3.  The upper few inches of the Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 coated and 5 crushed, and 3 or 4 moist, coated or crushed.  The Bt horizon has 50 to 60 percent clay, and has 10 to 15 percent more clay than the A horizon and from 5 to 10 percent more clay than in the upper C horizon.  It is clay or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has moderate to strong prismatic or blocky structure that separates to fine blocks.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The Bk horizon is clay and has few to common threads and masses of segregated lime.  The C horizon is clay loam.  Contrasting strata of transported material or of shale occur below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."
