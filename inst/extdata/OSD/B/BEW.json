  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to lime ranges from 11 to 20 inches thick.  Thickness of clay textures is 30 or more inches.  The clay is dominantly smecitite with a CEC of 50 to 70 millequivalents per 100 grams of carbonate-free clay.  Organic matter averages 2 percent in the upper 15 inches.  The soils are usually dry when not frozen unless they are irrigated.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.  It is neutral.  A 3 to 5 inch thick clay loam A1 horizon that has value of 6 dry and 4 moistis in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and chroma of 2 or 3.  The upper few inches of the Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 coated and 5 crushed, and 3 or 4 moist, coated or crushed.  The Bt horizon has 50 to 60 percent clay, and has 10 to 15 percent more clay than the A horizon and from 5 to 10 percent more clay than in the upper C horizon.  It is clay or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has moderate to strong prismatic or blocky structure that separates to fine blocks.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The Bk horizon is clay and has few to common threads and masses of segregated lime.  The C horizon is clay loam.  Contrasting strata of transported material or of shale occur below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

Arnhart soils have CEC of 150 to 300 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay and have less than 50 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Baca, Hesper, Renohill, Thurlow and Ulm soils have 35 to 50 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  In addition, Renohill soils have shale bedrock at depth of about 30 inches and Hesper soils have silt loam C horizons.  Big horn and Briggsdale soils have an abrupt boundary between the A horizons and the clay Bt horizons.  Hinman soils have less than one percent organic matter in the upper 15 inches of the pedon.  Malposa soils have mixed clay types with less than 50 percent cation exchange capacity and have sandstone or shale bedrock."
