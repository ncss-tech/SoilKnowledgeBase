Doyce soils have a calcic horizon with 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and 10 to 35 rock fragments below 43 to 60 cm.  Haw soils lack carbonate in any part of the argillic horizon.  Zen soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 250 to 330 mm and average annual temperature is 7.2 to10.0 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
