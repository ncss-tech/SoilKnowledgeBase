  "OVERVIEW": "The Babbington series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on alluvial flats and bottomlands.  They formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.",
