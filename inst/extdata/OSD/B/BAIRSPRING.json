  "OVERVIEW": "The Bairspring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from igneous or sedimentary rock.  These soils are on escarpments, hills, ridges and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.8 degrees C.",
