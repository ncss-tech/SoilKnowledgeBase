Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from volcaniclastic material.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, and average annual temperature is 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 95 days."
