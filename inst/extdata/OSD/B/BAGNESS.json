Elevations are 0 to 33 meters (0 to 100 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 1778 to 2286 millimeters (70 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 270 to 330 days."
