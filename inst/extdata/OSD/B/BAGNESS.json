  "OVERVIEW": "The Bagness series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Bagness soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
