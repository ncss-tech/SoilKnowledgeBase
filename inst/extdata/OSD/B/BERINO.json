  "OVERVIEW": "The Berino series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium, the surface of which has frequently been reworked by wind.  Berino soils are on sandy plains, fan piedmonts, piedmont slopes and valley floors that have slopes of 0 to 7 percent.  The mean precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Hap and Tres Hermanos soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments.  Madurez soils are noneffervescent in the argillic.  Mohave soils contain less than 50 percent sand.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Berino soils are in nearly level to undulating sandy plains, fan terraces, piedmont slopes, and valley floors at elevations of 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  The parent material is alluvium derived from mixed sources.  The content of quartz and other forms of Si02 is relatively high, it constitutes less than 90 percent of the soil material.  Berino landscapes are often irregular and coppice mounds are common.  The climate is arid continental.  The mean annual air temperature is 58 to 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 7 to 13 inches with a marked summer maximum.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days."

Turney, Pajarito, Pintura and Kermit soils lack argillic horizons."
