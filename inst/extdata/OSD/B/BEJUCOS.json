    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bejucos series are in small valleys between low limestone hills. Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  They formed in regolith that consists of moderate coarse over finer-textured sediments.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 61 to 71 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F."

Tanama soils are on higher positions have redder subsoils, and are shallow to hard limestone."
