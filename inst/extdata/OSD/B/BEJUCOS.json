  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bejucos series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on small valleys among limestone hills.  They formed in moderately coarse material over finer-textured sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 66 inches and the mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.",
