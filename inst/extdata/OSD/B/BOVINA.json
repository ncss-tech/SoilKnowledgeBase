  "OVERVIEW": "The Bovina series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
