  "OVERVIEW": "The Boomtown series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed colluvium mainly from andesites and basaltic rocks and in residuum from andestic rock.  Boomtown soils are on plateaus and mountain slopes.  These soils have slopes of 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist between the depths of 12 and 40 inches but are usually dry in all parts from August to October.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to highly weathered and bleached andesite is 60 to 80 inches.  When the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is mixed, the clay content is between 35 and 50 percent and the content of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 35 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has color value of 3, 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 15 to 50 percent rock fragments.  This horizon has weak, fine through medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4.  It has 15 to 50 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel size.  The B2t horizon has color value of 5, 6 or 7 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 4, 6, or 8.  It is clay or clay loam  modified by 5 to 35 percent saprolitic rock fragments.  Structure is prismatic or angular blocky.  Base saturation by sum of cations is less than 75 percent."

Slope gradients range from 4 to 50 percent.  The upper part of these soils formed in mixed colluvium and alluvium mainly from basaltic rock and andesite and the lower part formed in colluvium and residuum of andesite.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 50 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 50 to 80 days."
