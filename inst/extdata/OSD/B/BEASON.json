  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 35 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid in all horizons except the surface layer where limed. Fragments are less than 5 percent in all horizons. Transition horizons have colors and texture similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 8 with redox features of chroma 2 or less and common to many iron and manganese concretions within the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon. Most pedons are an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant color. The lower part of the Bt horizon or Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8 and chroma of 1 to 8 with few to many redox features in shades of brown and gray, with common to many iron and manganese concretions, nodules, and stains. Texture of the Bt or Btg horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay but includes silt loam in the upper part. Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the B horizon ranges from 35 to about 45 percent and silt content is greater than 30 percent.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon between the B horizon and C horizon.\nThe C horizon or Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 6 or is neutral. Most pedons are an evenly mottled pattern in shades of gray, brown, or yellow without a dominant color. Texture is commonly clay loam or silty clay loam but the range includes loam and silt loam. Add depth to bedrock greater than 60 inches."
