  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brokeoff series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra and colluvium over residuum from hydrothermally altered volcanic rock. Brokeoff soils are on convex mountain side slopes in hydrothermally altered areas. Slopes range from 10 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 117 inches (2972 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F (4 degrees C).",
