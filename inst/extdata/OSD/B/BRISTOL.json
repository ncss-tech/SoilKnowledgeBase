  "OVERVIEW": "The Bristol series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy outwash on outwash plains, outwash terraces, or kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
