  "OVERVIEW": "The Beefork series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils fed by springs and formed in a mantle of organic material and underlying gravelly to extremely gravelly colluvium and alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur mainly in upland drainageways on terraces, toeslopes and footslopes within the Ozark Highlands.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 13 degrees Celsius.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1,067 millimeters.",
