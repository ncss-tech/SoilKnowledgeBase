  "OVERVIEW": "The Babala series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from basalt.  The Babala soils are on lava plateaus.  Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
