Bouldrock soils are non-forested and do not have an O horizon, have darker values in the Bw and C horizons (4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist), and 0 to 20 percent gravel in the C horizon, and lack a paralithic contact of weathered granodiorite over a lithic contact. Selon, Snowshoe and Stavely soils are 60 inches or more deep. Wagontown soils are sandy-skeletal and 40 to 60 inches deep."
