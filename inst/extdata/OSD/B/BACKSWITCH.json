  "OVERVIEW": "The Backswitch series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 70 percent in mountains and intermontane basins. The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
