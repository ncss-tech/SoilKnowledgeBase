  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigbear series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on hills, escarpments and relict stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
