    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Batcave soils are on nearly level flood plains and low stream terraces. They formed in alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations are commonly 400 to 1,150 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearthicket, Deible, Higdon, Relfe, Sandbur, Tanglenook, and Zanoni soils. All are on similar positions as the Batcave soils. Bearthicket soils are well drained and are in the fine-silty family. Deible and Tanglenook soils are poorly drained and in the fine family. Higdon soils have an ochric epipedon and are fine-silty family. Relfe soils are excessively drained and are sandy-skeletal. Sandbur and Zanoni soils are well drained and are coarse-loamy family."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is negligible to very high. Permeability is moderate, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Most areas are subject to occasional to frequent flooding. There is an apparent water table within 18 inches of the surface during wet periods in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches. (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\n2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 80 inches. (Bt, 2Bt, and 3Bt horizons)\n3) Aquic feature - redoximorphic properties from 12 to 80 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: These soils are being mapped predominantly in the Jefferson City and Roubidoux formations (Ordivician age) in Missouri.\nSampled for the University of Missouri Soil Characterization Lab as M9709156. The lab data indicates that this pedon is semiactive, but the classification of active is based on a majority of the lab data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
