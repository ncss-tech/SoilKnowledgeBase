  "OVERVIEW": "The Batcave series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on floodplains and low stream terraces. These soils formed in gravelly alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
