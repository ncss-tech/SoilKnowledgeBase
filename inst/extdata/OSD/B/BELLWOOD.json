  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellwood series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in acid, clayey Tertiary age sediments. These nearly level to steep soils occur on  Coastal Plain uplands. Mean annual precipitation is about 1403 mm (55.23 in)and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (65.5 degrees F). Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.",
