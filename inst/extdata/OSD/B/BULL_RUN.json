  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils have a udic moisture regime but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to over 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The 60-inch profile is silt loam with measured clay of about 12 to 18 percent, a ratio of clay to 15-bar water of 1.0 or less, and a bulk density of about .70 to .85 gm/cc in the upper 2 feet of the profile.  They have an average 15-bar water retention of about 15 to 20 percent in the particle-size control section.  The phosphate retention is 90 to 100 percent, the acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron is 2.0 to 4.0 percent.  The soils are moderately to strongly acid.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and has 8 to 13 percent organic matter.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It has moderate or strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value closest to 3 in upper part and 3 or 4 in the lower part when moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 in the upper part and 4 through 6 in the lower part moist and dry.  It has weak or moderate very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon is mostly silt loam but gravelly glacial till is below depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

The soils formed in loess with some admixture of ash.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 105 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 37 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 200 days."
