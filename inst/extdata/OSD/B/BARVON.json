  "OVERVIEW": "The Barvon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from weakly consolidated interbedded sandy and silty sedimentary beds and semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
