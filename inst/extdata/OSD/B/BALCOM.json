  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of soft shale or sandstone is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from mid-April or May until late November or early December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments consist of small pieces of shale that are easily crushed.  Fragments are usually less than 10 percent and are no more than 35 percent.  The soil profile is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in all parts and has more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is slightly to violently effervescent throughout except in some pedons the upper few inches are not effervescent. Carbonate segregations range from a few small filaments to many seams, masses and blotches.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2; 10Y 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, and moist color is 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2.  In some pedons the upper part of the A horizon is one unit value darker than the Bk horizon.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent.\nThe Bk horizon is 2.5Y 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2; 10YR 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 25 percent.  In some pedons it is one unit darker than the underlying Cr horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in material weathered from gray, soft, calcareous shale and sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 22 inches.  Average January temperature is 53 degrees F., average July temperature is 68 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 63 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 175 to 350 days."

Dibble and Newville soils have argillic horizons.  Linne soils have mollic epipedons.  Mocho soils are in the valleys and have mollic epipedons.  Saugus soils have less than 18 percent clay throughout the profile."
