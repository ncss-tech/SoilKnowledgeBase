  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bonta soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks such as granodiorite, granite, or quartz diorite.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 80 days."
