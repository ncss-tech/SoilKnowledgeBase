  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonta series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Bonta soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 80 days."
