  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brewster soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum on igneous and metamorphic pediments, hills and mountains particularly quartzite. Slopes range from 1 to 90 percent. The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loamy earth, containing many coarse fragments. Underlying rocks are fine grained igneous rocks. Elevation ranges from 3,920 to 7,500 feet (1,195 to 2,286 meters).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches (305 to 508 mm), the majority coming in late spring and in summer. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F (13.9 to 17.8 degrees C). Frost-free period is 140 to 240 days."

Boracho and Espy soils have a petrocalcic horizon. Ector soils formed in limestone. Kokernot soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not have a mollic epipedon. Liv and Mainstay soils have a clayey-skeletal argillic horizon. Medley and Santo Tomas soils are deeper than 20 inches to bedrock."

Native vegetation consists of short and mid grasses and in places a few low desert shrubs. Grasses are mainly grama, bluestem, muhly, threeawn, and lovegrass. Woody vegetation is juniper, scrubby oak trees, and catclaw."
