  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 20 to 38 inches thick.  However, depth of alluvial sediments or soil material is more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section is clayey in the upper part and loamy in the lower part.  The weighted average clay content of the upper clayey part ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  The loamy lower part has an absolute decrease of 25 percent or more clay and the  transition zone between the clayey and loamy textures is less than 5 inches thick.  When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  The cracks remain open for 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and wedge shaped peds begin at a depth of 6 to 16 inches.  The reaction is moderately alkaline and it is slightly to violently effervescent throughout.\nThe A horizon has colors in shades of brown with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. The texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bss horizon has colors in shades of brown with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay or clay.  Slickensides range from few to common.  Some pedons have a thin Bw horizon that is like the Bss horizon except it does not have slickensides.\nThe 2C horizon has colors in shades of brown with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The texture is mainly very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Some subhorizons have discontinuous and/or continuous bedding planes 1/4 to 4 inches thick of these textures and/or slightly more sandy or more clayey textures.  Some pedons contain buried A horizons below a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Soils in similar families include Brazoria, Moreland, Navaca, Redlake, Ships, and Seagoville series. Brazoria, Moreland, Ships, and Redlake soils are clayey throughout.  Navaca soils have chroma of 1 in the upper part and hue of 10YR or yellower.  Seagoville soils have hue of 10YR or yellower.  In addition Navaca and Seagoville soils are cracked for more than 90 cumulative days in most years."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belk soils are on nearly level flood plains.  These soils are flooded about once every 5 to 30 years.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent but is mainly 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 64 degrees to 68 degrees F.; the elevation ranges from 150 to 500 feet above sea level; frost free days range from 225 to 280; and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 50 to 80."

Brazoria, Ships, and Redlake soils are in similar to slightly lower flood plain positions.  Norwood, Oklared, and Severn soils have a loamy surface layer and are on slightly higher flood plain positions.  Pledger soils have a very-fine particle-size control section and is in similar to slightly lower positions."
