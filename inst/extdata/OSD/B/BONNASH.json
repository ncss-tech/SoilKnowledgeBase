  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonnash series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium and glacial outwash with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
