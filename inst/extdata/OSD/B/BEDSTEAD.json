  "OVERVIEW": "The Bedstead series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in silty alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Bedstead soils are on foothills and tablelands.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
