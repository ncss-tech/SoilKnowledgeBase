  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Gravel or flagstone content of the surface ranges from 15 to 70 percent by volume. Some pedons are stony. Rock fragments are chert or dolostone.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have an Ap horizon. It is silt loam or the gravelly, flaggy, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or extremely cobbly analogues of sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or the gravelly, flaggy, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues of sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 8. Just above the lithic contact hues of 7.5YR or yellower are permitted. The texture is silty clay, clay, gravelly silty clay, or gravelly clay. The upper part of the 2Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid and the lower part of the 2Bt horizon is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons are slightly alkaline in the layer just above the lithic contact.\nSome pedons have a 2BC or 2C horizon that has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. It ranges from sand to clay loam. Rock fragments are 0 to 35 percent. It is 2 to 10 inches thick and rests on the lithic contact. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bardley soils are on summits, side slopes, back slopes, and nose slopes of hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 100 percent. They formed in hillslope sediments and the underlying residuum from dolomite interbedded with some limestone and sandstone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 47 inches."

Crider soils are fine-silty and occur above the Bardley soils in the landscape. Doniphan soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches of the surface and occur on similar landscapes. Gasconade soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and are usually lower in the landscape. Gatewood soils are moderately well drained and are lower in the landscape."

University of Missouri laboratory data lists clay percentages in the 2Bt as 87 and 89 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (A and E horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 8 to 27 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
