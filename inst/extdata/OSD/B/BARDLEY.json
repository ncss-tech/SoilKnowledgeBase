  "REVDATE": "06/2008",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bardley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in hillslope sediments and the underlying residuum from dolomite interbedded with some limestone and sandstone. These soils are on summits, side slopes, back slopes, and nose slopes of hills and ridges. Slopes range from 2 to 100 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

Rock fragments are chert or dolostone.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have an Ap horizon. It is silt loam or the gravelly, flaggy, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or extremely cobbly analogues of sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or the gravelly, flaggy, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues of sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 8. Just above the lithic contact hues of 7.5YR or yellower are permitted. The texture is silty clay, clay, gravelly silty clay, or gravelly clay. The upper part of the 2Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid and the lower part of the 2Bt horizon is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons are slightly alkaline in the layer just above the lithic contact.\nSome pedons have a 2BC or 2C horizon that has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. It ranges from sand to clay loam. Rock fragments are 0 to 35 percent. It is 2 to 10 inches thick and rests on the lithic contact. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

University of Missouri laboratory data lists clay percentages in the 2Bt as 87 and 89 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (A and E horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 8 to 27 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons)"
