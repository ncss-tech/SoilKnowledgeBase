  "OVERVIEW": "The Brasstown series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on ridges and side slopes of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  These soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite, slate, quartzite and thinly bedded metasandstone.  Slope ranges from 2 to 95 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 60 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 26 to 59 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact with soft weathered bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Content of rock fragments ranges up to 35 percent by volume.  Fragments are dominantly channers or gravel in the A, E, Bt, and BC horizons.  They range from channers to flagstones in the C horizon.  Content of mica flakes is few to common throughout.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8.  A horizons that have value of 3 are thinner than 6 inches.  This horizon is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It has the same textures as the A horizon.\nThe BA or BE horizons, where present, have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  They are loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  At least part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, are similar in color and texture to the BA and BE horizons.\nThe C horizon is similar in color to the BC horizon or is multicolored.  It is multicolored saprolite that is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored, fractured, and weathered metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite, slate, quartzite and thinly bedded metasandstone. It is partly consolidated but can be dug with difficulty with a spade."

Junaluska soils have a Cr horizon of weathered bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.\nNote: The above section has not been updated to reflect the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes are typically 15 to 50 percent, but range from 2 to 95 percent.  Brasstown soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite, slate, quartzite, and metasandstone.

Cataska, Soco, Stecoah, and Sylco soils do not have an argillic horizon. In addition, Cataska and Sylco are in a loamy-skeletal family.  Nantahala soils have a clayey Bt horizon.  Tsali soils are shallow to a Cr horizon. Cataska, Sylco, and Tsali soils are typically in very steep, less stable parts of the landscape.  Nantahala soils are in lower or smoother parts of the landscape.  Soco and Stecoah are at locally higher elevations or on very steep slopes."

The understory includes flowering dogwood, rhododendron, mountain-laurel, sourwood, blueberry, buffalo nut, blackgum, and red maple.  Some areas are used for pasture and cropland.  The main crops are corn and hay."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soils now placed in the Brasstown series were previously included in the Evard series.  However, Brasstown is derived from and has fragments of metasedimentary rocks, and Evard contains fragments of granite, gneiss, or schist.  The 6/99 revision updates the classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  The soil is placed in the subactive CEC activity class based upon NSSL lab data from the typifying pedon.\nLaboratory data from the typifying pedon were obtained from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, sample number S85NC-039-002.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - 0 to 6 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 10 to 29 inches (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact - the contact at 46 inches (the upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
