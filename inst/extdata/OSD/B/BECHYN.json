  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bechyn series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in a mantle of loamy material overlying metamorphic and igneous bedrock.  These soils are dominantly on rock-cored terraces. Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to a lithic or paralithic contact ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Free carbonates typically are not present, but a small amount is in the lower part of some pedons.  Rock fragments make up 0 to 10 percent, by volume, of the loamy mantle, mostly gravel in size.  In places there is up to 5 percent cobbles near the contact with the bedrock.  Rock fragments are igneous and metamorphic.  The clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 10 to 27 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or clay loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Textures are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2R horizon is typically granite, gneiss, or quartzite bedrock.  The boundary between the alluvial sediments and bedrock is typically abrupt.   Some pedons have a 2Cr horizon up to 6 inches thick overlying the bedrock.  The 2Cr horizon, when present, consists of disintegrated rock, discontinuous residuum, or kaolinitic material weathered from the underlying bedrock."

These soils formed in a mantle of loamy material overlying fractured and unfractured granite, gneiss, or quartzite bedrock.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 124 to 160. Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1100 feet."

The poorly and very poorly drained Calco, poorly drained Cedarrock and Millington soils, and very poorly drained Nishna soils are on lower lying positions on flood plains.  In addition, the Cedarrock soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The moderately well drained Du Page and Minneiska soils are on lower lying natural levees.  The moderately well drained Terril soils are on foot slopes of adjacent uplands."
