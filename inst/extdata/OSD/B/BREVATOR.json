A chert or pebble band commonly is above the Bt horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 5.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam or silt loam and strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value or 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is loam or silt loam or their cherty analogues.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the Bt horizon and C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is clay, clay loam, or silty clay with clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ainsworth, Clinton, Hatton, Haymarket (T), Lunt, Ursa, and Welda soils in the same family and the Armster, Armstrong, and Keswick series.  Ainsworth soils have sandy strata in the lower part of the profile.  Clinton , Hatton, and Welda soils have less sand throughout the profile.  In addition, Clinton and Hatton soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the upper Bt horizon.  Haymarket soils have coarse fragments of diabase and basalt.  Lunt soils have mica flakes in the B and C horizons and have coarse fragments of quartz.  Ursa soils do not have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Armster and Armstrong soils have a thicker dark colored surface.  Keswick soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper part of the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brevator soils are on convex side slopes and narrow interfluve positions.  Slope gradients range from 14 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in a glacial till derived paleosol with the horizons above the pebble band formed in localized pedisediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches."
