  "OVERVIEW": "The Baconcamp series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt or andesite. Baconcamp soil are on mountains, hills, and canyons. Slopes are 3 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Baconcamp soils are on mountains, hills, and canyons. They typically occur on north-facing shoulder and backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of loess. Slopes are 3 to 80 percent. Elevations range from 1,555 to 2,960 meters. The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 300 to 460 mm but ranges to 1000 mm on the summit of Steens Mountain. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
