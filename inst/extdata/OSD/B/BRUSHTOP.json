  "OVERVIEW": "The Brushtop series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous sandstone or siltstone.  These soils are on north-facing aspects on backslopes and footslopes of hills.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 20 to 40 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
