  "OVERVIEW": "The Broadway series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that contain free carbonates. These soils are on flood plains. They formed in alluvium derived from limestones, calcareous shales, greenstones, and sandstones. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

Secondary calcium carbonate concretions range from 0 to 10 percent and tend to increase with depth. Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and from 0 to 25 percent in the substratum. Many pedons contain shell fragments. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine- earth fraction."

Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, and Shottower soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Clubcaf, Gladehill, Gullion, Irongate, Newmarc, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils do not contain free carbonates and are on similar landscapes. Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on uplands. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces."

CEC class is based on the classification of similar and geographically associated soils. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Morphological, chemical, textural, and mineralogical data are reported in:\nEdmonds, W.J., D.D.
