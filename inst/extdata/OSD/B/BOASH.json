  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boash series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments or clayey glacial till overlying loamy glacial till on glacial lake plains. These soils have slow permeability in the upper part and moderate or moderately slow in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The clayey mantle has 2 to 10 percent rock fragments, where it is formed in till and no rock fragments where it is formed in glacial lacustrine sediments. The underlying loamy glacial till has 2 to 10 percent of rock fragments. These fragments have mixed lithology.\nTheA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is N 2/0. Texture is clay loam, silty clay, clay or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2 or is N 2/0. It typically has few through many, faint through prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkg, 2BCkg, 2CBkg or 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features throughout. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkg, 2BCkg, 2CBkg or 2Cg horizon in the Percy till phase has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. It has 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 2.00 g/cc.\nThe 2Bkg, 2BCkg, 2CBkg or 2Cg horizon in the Des Moines till phase has textures of loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.

They formed in a mantle of clayey lacustrine sediments or clayey glacial till over calcareous loamy glacial till. These sediments are of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches. The frost-free days range from 110 to 135.
