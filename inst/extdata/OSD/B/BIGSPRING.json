  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bigspring soils are on stream terraces and basin-floor remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and welded tuff over lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,650 to 1,740 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm but ranges as low as 150 mm where additional moisture is available as run-on moisture, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
