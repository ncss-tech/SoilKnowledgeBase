  "OVERVIEW": "The Ben Lomond series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone or granitic rocks. Ben Lomond soils are on uplands and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The soil between depths of about 8 and 24 inches usually becomes moist in some part in late November or December and remains moist until the end of April. The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 degrees F. Organic matter content is more than 1 percent at a depth of 20 to 32 inches. Base saturation is more than 50 percent in all parts and less than 75 percent in some or all parts and less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the profile to a depth of 30 inches. Coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 30 percent by volume in the textural control section.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/2). Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam,  loam or gravelly sandy loam. This horizon is medium acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/4, 5/3, 5/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/4). Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly sandy loam.  This horizon is medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4) with sand grains of dark gray, dark brown, or very pale brown (10YR 4/1, 4/3, 8/3). Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid."
