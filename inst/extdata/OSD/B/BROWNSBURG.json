    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to Bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to redox depletions or iron concentrations is deeper than 35 inches.  Content of clay in the control section is 10 to 17 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent in the surface, 0 to 5 percent in the upper part of solum, 15 to 50 percent in the lower part of solum and 30 to 90 percent in the substratum.  Content of rock fragments in the control section is 5 to 15 percent.  Kind of rock fragments are sedimentary and metamorphic shale, siltstone and sandstone, gravel and cobbles.  In unlimed areas, reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BE horizon (if it occurs) has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is moderate medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is moderate medium or coarse subangular blocky.  Consistence is firm.\nThe 2C horizon (if it occurs) has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is massive.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Alvin, Boyer, Burnsville, Council, Dryden, Eleva, Elmdale, Hillsdale, Lamont, Lapeer, Mecan, Oshtemo, Perrin and Wyocena soils are in the same family. Alvin soils contain more than 50 percent fine sand and very fine sand in the control section.  Boyer and Perrin soils are underlain by sand and gravel within 60 inches.  Burnsville soils contain textures of sand and coarse sand within depth of 60 inches.  Council soils formed in loamy deposits derived from loess deposits.  Dryden, Lapeer and Perrin soils contain free carbonates at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Eleva soils have a paralytic contact between 20 to 40 inches.  Elmdale soils have redox depletions of chroma 2 or less in the lower part of the subsoil.  Hillsdale soils contains less than 50 percent fine sand and very fine sand and averages less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Lamont soils do not have free carbonates within  depths of 60 inches.  Mecan soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the series control section.  Oshtemo and Wyocena soils contain more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the solum.  Oshtemo soils are not clearly differentiated, since it allows a loamy substratum phase.  With the recent revision in the series control section, this phase will become a proposed series at a later date."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brownsburg soils are on hills in the Northern piedmont Province.  The soils are on summits and back slopes.  They are formed in a thin mantle of loess and in the underlying material weathered from red metamorphic shale and siltstone residuum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 to 45 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free days range from 155 to 190."

Alton, Klinesville, Pope and Steinsburg soils lack the argillic horizon.   Reaville and Fountainville soils have redox depletions of chroma 2 or less in the upper argillic horizon.  Klinesville soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Chalfont and Doylestown soils have redox depletions of chroma 2 or less directly below the surface layer.  Bedington and Penn soils which do not have the thin loess mantle.  Lansdale soils contain more sand and coarse fragments.  Fountainville soils have a loess mantle less than 24 inches."
