  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barnard soils are on terraces and fan and terrace pediments.  They formed in mixed lacustrine and alluvial sediments derived from mixed rocks. Some areas of this soil have an influence of volcanic ash in the surface layer.  Elevation is 700 to 1,555 meters.  In California and Nevada it ranges to 1,895 meters.  Slope is 0 to 45 percent.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 330 mm.  The frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."

Delma soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 50 cm.  Lookout soils have ochric epipedons.  Ruckles soils are clayey-skeletal and shallow over basalt.  Ruclick soils are clayey-skeletal and moderately deep over basalt."
