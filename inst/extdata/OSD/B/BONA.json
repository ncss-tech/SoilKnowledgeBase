These soils formed in gravelly colluvium and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite or limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

The Cedargap soils are loamy-skeletal and are below the Bona soils immediately adjacent to narrow drainageways.  The Creldon and Hoberg soils have fragipans and are on broad upland ridges above the Bona soils.  Goss soils have an ochric epipedon and are on similar landforms.  Goodson soils have clayey particle size control sections and are on higher convex ridges."
