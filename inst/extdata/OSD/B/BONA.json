  "REVDATE": "03/2006",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bona series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in gravelly colluvium and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite or limestone bedrock.  These soils are on ridgetops and side slopes in upland prairie areas.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
