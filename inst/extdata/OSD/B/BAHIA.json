This soil does not fit the current concept of the Americus concept because it is in a thermic temperature regime.  The classification was updated with the 11/2004 draft from Mixed, isohyperthermic Psammentic Paleustalfs to Sandy, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Typic Paleargids based on laboratory data and a soil moisture study which recognize the Aridic Soil Moisture Regime in southern Puerto Rico.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Cabo Rojo Municipality, Puerto Rico; S81PR-007-001.  Sample by NSSL, Lincoln, NE., 08/1981.\nBahia soils are in MLRA 273.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
