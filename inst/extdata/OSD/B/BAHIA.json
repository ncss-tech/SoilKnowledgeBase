  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bahia series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on coastal plains of the Semiarid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in sandy marine deposits.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

This soil does not fit the current concept of the Americus concept because it is in a thermic temperature regime.  The classification was updated with the 11/2004 draft from Mixed, isohyperthermic Psammentic Paleustalfs to Sandy, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Typic Paleargids based on laboratory data and a soil moisture study which recognize the Aridic Soil Moisture Regime in southern Puerto Rico."
