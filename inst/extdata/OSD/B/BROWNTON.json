  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey glacial lacustrine sediments or in a mantle of clayey glacial lacustrine sediments and underlying loamy glacial till.  These soils are on glacial lacustrine plains or moraines.  They have slow permeability.  Their slopes are less than 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum ranges from 24 to 44 inches.  These soils have free carbonates in all parts, and the content of free carbonates ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  The thickness of the lacustrine sediments and the depth to glacial till range from 30 to 60 inches or more.  The lacustrine sediments contain less than 2 percent rock fragments by volume and the till contains 2 to 8 percent rock fragments.  The 10 to 40 inch section averages between 35 and 55 percent clay (excluding clay-size carbonates) and from 2 to 25 percent sand. The solum is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, but in some pedons it is silt loam.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Kolda soils are drier in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  The Marna soils do not have free carbonates in the solum. The Silver Creek soils have formed in alluvium and are drier in the soil moisture control section.  The Spicer soils are fine-silty."

They formed in 30 to 60 or more inches of clayey lacustrine sediments and loamy glacial till.  These sediments are from the Des Moines lobe and are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 26 to 30 inches."

Competing series and other updates will be made later."
