    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Annemaine, Beason, Bush River, Chickasawhay, Cid, Creedmoore, Dogue, Dorian, Gritney, Helena, Lignum, Nemours, Newco, Prosperity, Telfair and Wolftever series. The Craven, Eulonia, Maubila, Nevarc, Peawick, Sacul and Stapp soils are in closely related families. Annemaine soils are on higher adjacent terrace positions and have redder subsoils. The somewhat poorly drained Beason soils have yellower subsoils. Bush River soils are deep to felsic and mafic rock. Cid soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Creedmoore soils formed in material that weathered from Triassic sandstone and shale. Dogue soils have less than 30 percent silt in the particle size control section. Dorian soils formed in alluvial material that weathered from felsic and mafic rock. Gritney soils are on upland positions.  Helena soils are on uplands and formed in material that weathered from felsic and mafic material. The somewhat poorly drained Lignum soils are deep to Carolina slate. Nemours soils are on upland positions. Newco soils are on upland positions in Texas. Prosperity soils are moderately deep to felsic and mafic rock. Telfair soils are moderately deep to sandstone. Wolftever soils are in the Appalachian Ridge and Valley and Highland Rim. Craven, Eulonia, Maubila and Nevarc soils are in the subactive activity class. In, addition, Craven soils are on higher, non-flooding positions, Eulonia soils have redder subsoils and are on higher non-flooding positions, Maubila soils are on higher upland positions and have more than 5 percent ironstone fragments, by volume, throughout the profile, Nevarc soils are in Virginia, are on higher positions and have less than 50 inches of annual rainfall. Peawick, Sacul and Stapp are in the active activity class.  In addition, Peawick soils are on higher non-flooding positions, have yellower subsoils and receive less than 50 inches of annual rainfall. Sacul soils are on upland positions and have redder subsoils. Stapp soils are deep to shale bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buckatunna soils are on nearly level to undulating low stream terraces in the Southern Coastal Plain. They formed in stratified clayey fluvial sediments. The climate is warm and humid with average annual temperature of 65 degrees F. and average annual precipitation of 55 inches near the type location.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 5 percent but range up to 8 percent."

The well drained Bassfield and Cahaba soils are on higher terrace positions. The excessively drained Bigbee soils are sandy in the particle size control section and are on natural lower levee positions. The coarse-loamy Jena soils are in slightly higher positions on natural levees. The somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils are in slightly lower, less convex positions. The moderately well drained Mooreville soils have fine-loamy particle size control sections. The poorly drained Una and the somewhat poorly drained Urbo soils are on lower adjacent positions."
