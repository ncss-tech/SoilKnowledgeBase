It has 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam, with 20 to 40 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

The soils formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface horizons.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.  This soil is on the Winkle geomorphic surface."
