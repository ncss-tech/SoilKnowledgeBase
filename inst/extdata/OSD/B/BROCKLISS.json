Elevations range from 1,495 to 1,590 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Jubilee soils are coarse-loamy and have aquic conditions within 50 cm of the soil surface.  Mackranch soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have aquic conditions at depths between 50 and 76 cm from the soil surface."
