  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Buckeystown soils are similar to Britwater, Holstein, Morven, Negley, and Sonora. Britwater soils are formed from old stream terrace deposits. Holstein soils form from colluvium of sandstone and limestone. Morven soils are loamy colluvium over calcareous Triassic conglomerate residuum. Negley soils form from glacial outwash materials, Sonora soils form from a silt mantle over sandstone and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buckeystown soils are nearly level to moderately steep uplands of the northern piedmont region. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent, but are commonly 3 to 15 percent. The soil formed in residuum material weathered from sandy limestone. Elevation ranges from 250 to 800 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F. The frost free period is 170 to 190 days."

Dryrun and Murrill soils are formed from mixed colluvium of sandstone and shale over limestone residuum. Duffield soils have less than 45 percent sand in the particle size control section. Funkstown soils are moderately well drained and develop from alluvial/colluvial sediments over limestone residuum. Hagerstown has more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and less sand. Lindside and Melvin soils form from alluvial sediments and are associated with perennial streams, and are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained respectively. Penn soils formed from Triassic red shales and have bedrock within 40 inches. Ryder soils are moderately deep to rock. Swanpond soils are moderately well drained. Walkersville soils form in old alluvium on stream terraces over limestone."
