    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the soil over the indurated caliche lies typically between about 18 and 36 inches, but may fall outside those limits.  For the most part, the caliche beds are strongly indurated wherever the soil profile characteristics are well developed.  Normally, the upper part of the B horizon is moderately well oxidized, while the lower part shows distinct evidence of gleying and may be nearly uniformly olive in color.  In some localities, the A2 horizon consists primarily of strongly coated granular peds transitional in texture between the A1 or Ap horizon and the underlying B horizon but breaking abruptly in texture at the lower boundary."
