  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the soil ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The chalk of the Cr horizon has hardness of 1 or 2 on Mohs scale, and it can be dug with a spade.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3, or it has hue of 2.5Y, value of 3, and chroma of 2, or it is neutral with value of 3, and chroma of 0.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Some pedons contain few to common fine to coarse fragments of chalk.  These and the chalk fragments in the C horizon have hardness considerably less than 3 on Mohs scale.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6, or it has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  The C horizon contains from 10 to 30 percent by volume of chalk fragments ranging from less than 2 to 60 mm in diameter.  From the surface to the top of the Cr horizon, the soil averages about 40 percent clay and the range is from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe Cr horizon and the chalk in the C horizon have hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 4, or it is neutral with value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 0."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Demopolis, Stephen, and Sumter series.  Demopolis soils, which do not have a mollic epipedon, are loamy-skeletal in the control section.  Stephen soils have a ustic moisture regime.  Sumter soils, which do not have a mollic epipedon, have a thicker solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Binnsville soils are on erosional uplands in the Blackland Prairie.  Slopes range from 1 to 17 percent.  These very gently sloping to steep soils formed mainly in the weathered Selma Chalk Formation of Cretaceous age.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 52 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Demopolis and Sumter soils of the competing series and the Brooksville, Eutaw, Houston, Kipling, Okolona, Oktibbeha, Vaiden, and Watsonia series.  Demopolis and Sumter soils are on similar positions as the Binnsville soils, and, in places, they are in geographic mixtures that form complexes.  Brooksville, Houston, and Okolona soils have a thick dark solum and are in broad, fairly large areas.  Eutaw, Kipling, Oktibbeha, and Vaiden soils are more than 20 inches thick, have a Bt horizon, and are acid in reaction;\nEutaw soils are on nearly level slopes; Kipling and Vaiden soils are on narrow to broad areas in uplands; Oktibbeha soils are on hillsides and ridgetops.  Watsonia soils, which do not have a\nmollic epipedon, are in uplands of the Blackland Prairie that are characterized by short, complex slopes."
