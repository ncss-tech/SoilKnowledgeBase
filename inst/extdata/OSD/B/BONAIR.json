The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where limed. Some pedons have few coarse fragments in each horizon.  The sand fraction is 95 to 99 percent quartz.\nThe A horizon, or Ap in plowed areas, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam or, in a few pedons, fine sandy loam.  In most pedons, the Bg horizon is mottled with colors of olive, yellow, brown and gray.\nThe C horizon has the range of colors given for the B horizon.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."
