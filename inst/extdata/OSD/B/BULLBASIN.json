The soil moisture control section is usually moist.  Bedrock is at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section contains 5 to 25 percent rock fragments and 10 to 27 percent clay.  They are typically gravel, but include cobble.  Reaction is neutral to slightly acid throughout the pedon.  Mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, with chroma of 3 through 6.  Textures are loam or sandy loam.\nThe BC or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, with chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures are loam or sandy loam."

In addition, the Adel soils lack a 2BC horizon with 50 percent cobbles above 40 inches.  The Duff, Hackwood, Pavohroo, and Taterheap soils have mean annual soil temperatures warmer than 38 degrees F.  The Gallatin, Leavittville,Mundos, and Osmund soils have consistent k horizons.  The Idmon soils are underlain by sand and gravel below a depth of about 30 inches, are moderately well drained and have mean annual soil temperature of 39 to 41 degrees F.  The Karlan, Lespate, Secondset, Strickland, and Winevada soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Gallatin soils lack a 2BC horizon with 50 percent cobble above 40 inches."
