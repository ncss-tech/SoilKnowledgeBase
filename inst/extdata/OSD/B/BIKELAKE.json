Bobzbulz soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and have higher average rock fragments in the control section. Detrital soils have a thicker subsoil, allow redder hues in the subsoil, are calcareous within 20 inches of the soil surface, and receive more precipitation. Klipstein soils have a moisture control section that is moist in some part more than half the time, cumulative, that the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F. Vado and Wickenburg soils are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative between July and September. In addition, Wickenburg soils are shallow to a paralithic contact."

The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."
