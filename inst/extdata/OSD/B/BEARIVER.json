  "OVERVIEW": "The Beariver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Beariver soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
