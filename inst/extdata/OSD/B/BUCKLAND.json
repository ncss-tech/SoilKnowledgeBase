  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckland series consists of moderately well drained soils on hills in glaciated uplands. These soils formed in loamy lodgment till derived from metamorphic rocks. They are moderately deep to a dense substratum and very deep to bedrock. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately low or moderately high in the dense substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1185 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 51 to 91 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent. Fragments are mainly phyllite, schist, and metamorphosed limestone. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Texture is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or their gravelly or channery analogues.\nSome pedons have Oi, Oe, and/or Oa horizons overlying the A horizon. Combined thickness of the O horizons is 0 to 10 cm thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon that has properties similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4, with iron depletions in the matrix. Matrix chroma of 2 in the Bw horizon is inherited from the parent material and is not indicative of wetness. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has colors and textures similar to that of the lower part of the Bw horizon. It is up to 20 cm thick.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Structure is weak or moderate, thin to thick platy or is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

Bomoseen, Georgia, and Minoa soils have a mesic temperature regime. Eelweir soils formed in glaciofluvial sediments. Fullam soils have an ochric epipedon. Kalurah soils formed in calcareous, friable till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buckland soils are nearly level to steep soils on hills in glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed in dark colored lodgment till derived mainly from phyllite and schist. Small amounts of limestone have contributed to the character of the till in places. The mean annual precipitation is 910 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost free period is from 70 to 135 days. Elevations range from 100 to 700 meters above mean sea level."

The well drained Dummerston, Shelburne, and Vershire soils and the somewhat excessively drained Glover soils are on rises. The poorly drained Cabot soils and the very poorly drained Peacham soils are in open and closed depressions."

White and red spruce, northern white cedar, and balsam fir also are common in the northern range of the series. Areas presently farmed are used for hayland and pasture. A small acreage of corn is grown for silage."
