  "OVERVIEW": "The Bomber series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in siliceous alluvium over gypsiferous coarse-loamy eolian deposits. These nearly level soils are on drainageways on fan piedmonts. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
