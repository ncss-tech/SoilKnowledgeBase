These soils formed from clayey alluvium over coarse-loamy gypsiferous eolian deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,970 to 4,280 ft. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."

Corvus soils have petrogypsic horizons between 5 and 20 inches and are on relict dunes and fan piedmonts. Matador soils have salic horizons and are in similar positions. Tornado soils are greater than 40 percent clay in the particle size control section, have mixed mineralogy and are in drainages. Nasa soils have a petrogypsic horizon between 20 and 40 inches and are on fan piedmonts. Yesum soils have a gypsic horizon within 7 inches from the surface (Leptic) and are on fan piedmonts."
