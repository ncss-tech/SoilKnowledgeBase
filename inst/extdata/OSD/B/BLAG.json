These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice.   The particle-size control section averages 5 to 10 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  Structure is weak fine or medium granular or crumb.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Structure is weak fine or medium subangular blocky.  Rock fragments ranges from 5 to 20 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blag soils are on mountainsides that generally have a southerly aspect.  Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived primarily from sandstone of the Chumstick formation.  Elevations are l,500 to 4,000 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters with a snow pack from about December to March.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 28 inches.  The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F., average July temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the average annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is l60 to l85 days."
