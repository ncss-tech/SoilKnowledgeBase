  "OVERVIEW": "The Benavides series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy sediments of the Goliad Formation. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on sideslopes of interfluves. Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).",
