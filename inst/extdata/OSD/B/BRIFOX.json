  "OVERVIEW": "The Brifox series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and tuff. They are on hills and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
