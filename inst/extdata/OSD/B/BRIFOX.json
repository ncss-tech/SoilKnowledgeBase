All of the above soils, except Watercanyon, have mollic epipedons.  Iphil, Kucera, Rexburg, Ririe and Watercanyon soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section.  Kucera and Lanoak soils are pachic and Lanoak has a fine-silty particle-size control section.  Iphil, Ririe and Watercanyon soils are on convex positions on hillslopes.  Kucera and Lanoak soils are in concave positions on hillslopes.  Niter soils are on smooth to slightly concave toeslopes and hillslopes.  Rexburg soils are on less sloping areas on hilltops and footslopes."
