  "OVERVIEW": "The Berner series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in herbaceous organic materials overlying stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine deposits underlain by loamy calcareous till or lacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderate in the organic material, rapid in the sandy sediments and moderate or moderately slow in the underlying material.  These soils are on lake plains and slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic material ranges from 16 to 50 inches thick.  Fibers are dominantly herbaceous and fiber content ranges from 5 to 40 percent unrubbed and less than 10 percent when rubbed.  The organic material does not contain free carbonates.  In some pedons it contains up to 15 percent by volume wood fragments.  Depth to the loamy till or lacustrine sediments ranges from 30 to 55 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 0 to 20 percent in the upper mantle (A and Bg horizons).\nThe Oa horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, or are neutral, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 0 to 3.  They are dominantly sapric material, but some pedons may contain as much as 10 inches of hemic material in the surface or subsurface tiers.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or less.  It is sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have Bkg horizons instead of Bg horizons.  It has colors and textures similar to the Bg horizon.\nThe 2CBkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.    Reaction slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have 2Cg horizons that have colors and textures similar to the 2CBkg horizon.\nThe 2CBkg or 2Cg horizons in the Percy till phase have textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  They have 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand.  They have 2 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 2.00 g/cc.\nThe 2CBkg or 2Cg horizons in the Des Moines till phase have textures of loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  They have 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand.  They have 2 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.35 to 1.60 g/cc.\nWhere formed in silty calcareous glacial lacustrine sediments, the 2CBkg and 2Cg horizons have textures of very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Total clay averages less than 35 percent.  The sediments are free of rock fragments and may be finely stratified or laminated with clay."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches.  The frost free period ranges from 88 to 135 days.

An apparent water table is as high as from 1 foot above to 0.5 feet below the soil surface at some time during November to June in most years.

It will also replace soils mapped as Markey, loamy substratum.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
