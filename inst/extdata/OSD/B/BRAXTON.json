  "OVERVIEW": "The Braxton series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  They are on undulating to hilly uplands and high terraces.  They formed in old clayey alluvium or valley fill and residuum weathered from limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 60 to 80 inches or more.  Fragments of chert in the Ap horizon range from none to as much as 30 percent.  Fragments of chert in the Bt horizons range from none to about 15 percent.  The soil is strongly acid to moderately acid throughout except that the horizon above the bedrock is only slightly acid in some pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 35 to about 50 percent.  Transition horizons have colors and texture similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Severely eroded areas also have chroma of 6.  Pedons with value of 3 and chroma of 2 are less than 7 inches thick.  The fine earth texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have A and E horizons or transitional horizon that formed in loamy colluvium from sandstone and have loam texture.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the Bt horizon is silty clay or clay except the upper few inches in some pedons is silty clay loam.  Most pedons have mottles in shades of red or brown in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has colors and texture similar to the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red ranges from none to common."

Dewey soils have base saturation less than 35 percent and kaolinitic mineralogy.  Mimosa and Talbott soils have sola less than 60 inches thick over hard bedrock."
