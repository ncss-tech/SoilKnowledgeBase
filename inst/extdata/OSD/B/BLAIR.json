  "OVERVIEW": "The Blair series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on dissected till plains.  They formed in silty, water-worked sediments, or in those sediments and the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 40 to 68 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 25 percent sand, and less than 10 percent gravel by volume.  Commonly about one-third to one-half of the sand is very fine.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap, A, and E) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam, except some eroded pedons are silty clay loam or clay loam.  Clay content is 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid except in pedons that have been limed range to neutral.\nIn some eroded pedons the E horizon has been mixed into the Ap horizon.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bt horizons that formed in silty sediments) has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4 in the upper part.  In the middle and lower part it has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or less commonly 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8.  Clay films have chroma of 2 or 3 in the upper part and 1 or 2 in the lower part.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part and strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons have a 2Bt horizon in the lower part formed in accretion gley or in till that contains a strongly developed paleosol.\nPedons with a BC horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Colors of redoximorphic features are in the range as defined for the Bt horizon and also include 5YR hue.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam, and reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe lower part of the control section (Cg) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has redoximorphic features.  Texture is silt loam or loam, and reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that is underlain by buried horizons of older soils and other pedons do not have a C horizon; where the modern soil is welded to the paleosol."

Bunkum, Geff and Muren soils average less than 7 percent sand in the upper part of the series control section and contain less rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Fishhook soils averages more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Glenford soils do not have a matrix color with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part of the series control section.  Henshaw, Ingersoll, Lykens, Torox, and Xenia soils contain carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Keene soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 84 inches.  Travilah soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blair soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep parts of dissected Illinoian till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils primarily formed in silty, water-worked sediments that lie in a stratigraphic position between the Wisconsinan age Peoria loess and the Illinoian till that contains a strongly developed paleosol.  Some pedons have the lower part of the solum formed in till.  Some pedons have a mantle of loess on the surface as much as 20 inches in thickness.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 200 days, and elevation is 350 to 800 feet above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atlas, Bluford, Darmstadt, Grantfork, Hickory, Hosmer, Hoyleton, Marine, and Ursa soils.  Atlas and Ursa soils formed in the strongly developed paleosol in the till and are downslope from the Blair soils.  Bluford, Darmstadt, Hosmer, Hoyleton, Marine, and Stoy soils are upslope from the Blair soils where the loess is thicker.  Bluford soils contain more clay in the control section and have fragic properties in the lower part of the solum.  Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon.  Hosmer soils have fragic properties in the lower part of the solum.  Hoyleton and Marine soils contain more clay in the control section.  Grantfork soils have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil and contain more fine sand and coarser sand in the control section.  They are on adjacent or nearby parts of the landscape.  Hickory soils formed in till and contain more sand in the control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Blair soils are not considered to have an aquic moisture regime.  Soil colors with chroma of 2 in the upper part of the solum are believed to be relict.  Severe erosion has truncated the typical pedon so that the Ap horizon is underlain immediately by a horizon with these grayer colors and mottles.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for the typical pedon, 79IL-145-8, are attached.  Data for other pedons are on file at the SCS Illinois state office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
