  "OVERVIEW": "The Brokenhorn series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in local alluvium and residuum derived from gypsiferous shale.  They are on gently rolling uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
