  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nWater tables occur naturally within one foot of the surface in winter in undrained areas, most areas are now drained artificially. Thin strata of peat, less than 2 inches thick, may occur in the lower A and IIC horizons; buried A horizons may be present. Phases are recognized with coarse strata below 40 inches. Distinct or prominent mottles occur within two to four feet of the surface or the soil below the A has chromas less than 2, with low chromas usually due to lime. The soils are strongly calcareous throughout. Saline areas may occur, but are inextensive.\nDry color of the Ap and Ak horizons ranges from gray to dark gray (values of 5 or less) in neutral or 10YR hues; chromas are 0 or 1 but may approach 2 in places. Texture is generally loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. The texture of the 10 to 40 inches section is fine loamy with 18 to 35 percent clay. At least the upper part of the Ap has moderate or strong granular structure.\nThe I2Ckg horizons range from light gray and white to gray and dark grayish brown with hues from 10YR to 5Y. Olive hues are present to some degree in the lower C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bayshore soils occur in nearly level basins and developed under a cover of grasses and sedges. The alluvium is derived from mixed but dominantly sedimentary formations. Bayshore soils occur at elevations of 30 to 100 feet in a dry subhumid mesothermal climate having a mean annual precipitation of 13 to 15 inches with moderately warm, but rainless, foggy summers and cool moist winters; an average January temperature is 48 degrees F, an average July temperature of 68 degrees F, and a mean annual temperature of 59 degrees F, and an average frost-free season of about 330 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Bayshore soils occur in the same general area as Agueda, Camarillo, Corralitos, Metz, Mocho, Salinas and Sorrento soils. Agueda soils are well or moderately well drained. Camarillo soils have Bk horizons and lack mollic epipedons. Corralitos soils have a sand textures. Metz soils have a sandy particle size. Mocho soils are well drained. Salinas soils are well drained and non calcareous in the A horizon. Sorrento soils are well drained and have free carbonates deeper in the soil profile."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly and poorly drained; drainage has been altered due to pumping, drainage ditches, and general lowering of water table has reclaimed some areas with the water table generally below 5 feet. Undrained areas may have seasonal water tables to within 1 to 2 feet of the surface. Runoff is slow. Permeability is moderate to moderately slow."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Bayshore soils were formerly classified as Calcium Carbonate Solenchaks. Present classification assumes a calcic horizon coincident with the Ak, a conclusion supported by limited data. It is not certain that there is always more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in all areas.\nLast revised by the state on 11/65.\nType location moved to Santa Barbara County 7/2011, the 1964 description is revised for the type location.  Areas previously mapped as Bayshore in Santa Clara County are now classified as Bayshore Taxadjunct.\nClassification note-This pedon is classified as Calciaquolls although the depth to the calcic horizon exceeds the taxonomic criteria by 1 inch. Due to land leveling and the upper part of the A horizon a cultivated plow layer, this discrepancy is considered minor. Soil temperatures need further study for some areas of Bayshore soils near the coast for possible fit with isomesic soil temperature class.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
