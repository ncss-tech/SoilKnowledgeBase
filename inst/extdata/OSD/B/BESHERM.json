  "OVERVIEW": "The Besherm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The Besherm soils are on old lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
