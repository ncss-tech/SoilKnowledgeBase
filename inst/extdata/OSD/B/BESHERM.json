The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool winters.  The mean annual precipitation is between 3 to 5 inches with relatively even monthly distribution with slight peaks in January and August.  Mean annual temperature is between 60 and 64 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 220 days."
