    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\nArgillic horizon - from 18 to 60 inches.  (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)\nUltic intergrade - base saturation is assumed to be less than 75 percent in one or more horizons in the upper 30 inches of the argillic horizon.\nMollic intergrade - color value moist of 3 in the A horizon with more than 0.7 percent organic carbon.\nParticle-size control section - from 18 to 38 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nThis soil has restricted drainage and is considered moderately well drained.  The soil does not meet the criteria for low chroma mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface, thus this soil is placed in the Ultic subgroup of Haploxeralfs and not the Aquic or Aquultic subgroups.  There appears to be a fragipan or degraded fragipan at depths greater than 60 inches and in some areas as shallow as 40 inches.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the classification in 10/2005. The competing series section was not updated at that time. Last revision 3/1995.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
