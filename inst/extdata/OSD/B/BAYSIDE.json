  "OVERVIEW": "The Bayside series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Bayside soils are in depressional areas on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperatures varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 and 10 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.   Depth to the contrasting 3C horizon is 40 to 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 15 to over 30 inches thick.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam with 27 to 30 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam with 30 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Common, fine to medium, distinct to prominent redox depletions occur throughout this horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Common, fine to medium, distinct to prominent redox concentrations occur throughout this horizon.\nThe 3Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam or loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.   Few to many, fine to medium, faint to prominent redox concentrations occur throughout this horizon."

The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 270 to 330 days.  Bayside soils are on the Ingram geomorphic surface."

Ettersburg soils are well drained, have regularly decreasing organic carbon content with depth and a rare flooding hazard.   Pistolriver soils are somewhat poorly drained and have contrasting textures between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bagness, Bigriver, and Pistolriver soils are on flood plains.  Ettersburg soils are on adjacent low stream terraces."
