  "OVERVIEW": "The Becket series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle overlying dense, sandy till on drumlins and glaciated uplands. They are moderately deep to a densic contact. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and moderately low or moderately high in the dense substratum. Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1175 mm and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the mineral solum, and from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Rock fragment are dominantly gravel and range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum and from 5 to 40 percent in the substratum. Rock fragments constitute less than 35 percent of the particle-size control section. Ortstein ranges from 0 to 20 percent of the spodic horizon.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4. It is slightly, moderately or highly decomposed plant material.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is up to 15 cm thick. Disturbed areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The A and Ap horizons are dominantly fine sandy loam, but include loam and sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam, but includes loam and sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.

Structure is granular, platy, or subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is comprised of loamy layers and sandy pockets and lenses with horizontal orientation, with a composite texture of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. The lenses are coarse, medium, or fine sand and are 1/8 to 3 inches thick. They make up 20 percent or more of the horizon. They are massive, with or without plate-like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm. Some pedons have friable C horizons up to 20 cm thick."

The well drained Marlow soils and moderately well drained Peru soils have densic materials with less than 20 percent sand lenses. The somewhat excessively drained Hermon soils, the well drained Berkshire and Monadnock soils, and the moderately well drained Sunapee soils have friable substrata. The somewhat excessively drained Lyman, and well drained Tunbridge soils are on bedrock controlled landforms and have bedrock within 51 and 102 cm of the mineral surface respectively.
