  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mineral solum thickness ranges from 51 to 91 cm. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the mineral solum, and from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Rock fragment are dominantly gravel and range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum and from 5 to 40 percent in the substratum. Rock fragments constitute less than 35 percent of the particle-size control section. Ortstein ranges from 0 to 20 percent of the spodic horizon.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4. It is slightly, moderately or highly decomposed plant material.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is up to 15 cm thick. Disturbed areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The A and Ap horizons are dominantly fine sandy loam, but include loam and sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam, but includes loam and sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 8 and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular, platy, or subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is comprised of loamy layers and sandy pockets and lenses with horizontal orientation, with a composite texture of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. The lenses are coarse, medium, or fine sand and are 1/8 to 3 inches thick. They make up 20 percent or more of the horizon. They are massive, with or without plate-like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm. Some pedons have friable C horizons up to 20 cm thick."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Marlow, Mundal, Mundalite and Plaisted series. Marlow soils have loamy substrata with less than 20 percent sand lenses or pockets. The duration of saturation in the subsoil is greater in Mundal soils which are moderately well drained. Mundalite soils have spodic horizons greater than 46 cm. Plaisted soils have greater than 50 percent silt in the particle-size control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Becket soils are on drumlins and glaciated uplands. Slope is dominantly 3 to 35 percent, but ranges from 3 to 60 percent. The soils formed in stony till of Wisconsin age derived principally from granite, gneiss, and schist on drumlins and glaciated uplands. Mean annual temperature ranges from -3 to 9 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 2420 mm. The frost-free growing season ranges from 90 to 160 days."

The moderately well drained Skerry, somewhat poorly drained Adirondack, and very poorly drained Sabattis soils are in a drainage sequence with Becket soils. The well drained Marlow soils and moderately well drained Peru soils have densic materials with less than 20 percent sand lenses. The somewhat excessively drained Hermon soils, the well drained Berkshire and Monadnock soils, and the moderately well drained Sunapee soils have friable substrata. The somewhat excessively drained Lyman, and well drained Tunbridge soils are on bedrock controlled landforms and have bedrock within 51 and 102 cm of the mineral surface respectively. The somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Pillsbury and Lyme soils are in depressions and drainageways."

Spodic horizons - the zone from 10 to 36 cm (Bhs, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons).\nc. Densic contact - at 84 cm.\nd. Densic materials - the zone from 84 to 170 cm (Cd horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
