  "OVERVIEW": "The Bastian series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Bastian soils are on floodplains or toe slopes of fan piedmonts and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",

They have developed in loamy alluvium from mixed rock sources that are predominantly ignimbrite and dacite, together with some silty Teriary lake beds, dolomite and limestone.  Bastian soils occur at elevations of 1,158 to 1,280 meters. Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C.  The frost free season is 160 to 180 days."

Geer soils are coarse-loamy and lack durinodes.  Maynard Lake soils are sandy.  Pahranagat soils have mollic epipedons and have fine-silty particle-size control sections."
