  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils occupy the smooth outer flanks of flood plains and toe slopes of fans where the slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent.  They have developed in loamy alluvium from mixed rock sources that are predominantly ignimbrite and dacite, together with some silty Teriary lake beds, dolomite and limestone.  Bastian soils occur at elevations of 1,158 to 1,280 meters. Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C.  The frost free season is 160 to 180 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Basitian soils occur in the same general area as Ash Springs, Geer, Maynard Lake, and Pahranagat.  Ash Springs soils have calcic horizons.  Geer soils are coarse-loamy and lack durinodes.  Maynard Lake soils are sandy.  Pahranagat soils have mollic epipedons and have fine-silty particle-size control sections."
