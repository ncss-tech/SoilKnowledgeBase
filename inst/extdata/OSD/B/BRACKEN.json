  "OVERVIEW": "The Bracken series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks. Bracken soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
