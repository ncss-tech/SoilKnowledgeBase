  "OVERVIEW": "The Bolar series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in interbedded limestones and calcareous marls formed in residuum.  These occur on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges on hills.  The slopes range is 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 to 20 degrees C (64 to 68 degrees F).",
