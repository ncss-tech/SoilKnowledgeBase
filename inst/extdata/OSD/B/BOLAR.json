  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  The silicate clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Fragments of limestone and indurated carbonate concretions range from pebble to stone size, but are mainly less than 18 inches across and range from a few to 35 percent by volume.  Some thin lower layers contain up to 50 percent by volume of limestone fragments.  The fragments are throughout the pedon or exist in discontinuous stone lines or as remnants of a petrocalcic horizon.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 75 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or their gravelly counterparts.\nThe Bk horizons have colors with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, or their gravelly counterparts.\nThe R layer is indurated fractured limestone interbedded with chalky limestone, marl, or marly clay at vertical intervals of 6 to about 12 inches."

Carbengle, Rumley, Sunev, and Topsey soils lack a lithic contact within 40 inches.  Austin and Quanah soils have less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Clarke, Engle, Nuvalde, and Venus soils have less than 40 percent carbonates in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  In addition, Nuvalde soils have more than 35 percent average clay content in the Bt horizon.  Denton soils are more clayey in the upper part. Doss soils have a paralithic contact with limestone at depths of 11 to 20 inches.  Purves soils are more clayey and have a lithic contact with limestone at depths of 8 to 20 inches.  Somervell soils contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the 10- to 40-inch control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bolar soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep uplands.  Slope gradients are predominantly 1 to 5 percent, but range to 15 percent.  The soil formed in interbedded limestones and calcareous marls of cretaceous age mainly in the Georgetown, Denton clay, Fort Worth limestone, Duck Creek limestone, and Kiamichi clay formations.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches, Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are about 44 to 56, and mean annual temperature is about 64 to 68 degrees F."
