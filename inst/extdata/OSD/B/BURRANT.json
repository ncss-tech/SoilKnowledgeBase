  "OVERVIEW": "The Burrant series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from sandstone mixed with loess.  Burrant soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 3 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum is 36 to 44 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments and 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam.  Soil reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam.  Soil reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Ardening soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and average 15 to 35 percent weathered schist fragments in the particle-size control section.  Billyridge soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and average 5 to 25 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Canderly and Crouch soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F. and both soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Catelli, Ginnis, Shangland,  Spokane, and Usk soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Conconully soils are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days and average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Donavan soils have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Fanal soils have mottles in the lower B and C horizons.  Hellgate soils have 25 to 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Picard soils are very fine sandy loam and fine sandy loam in the Bw horizon.  Rebecca soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.
