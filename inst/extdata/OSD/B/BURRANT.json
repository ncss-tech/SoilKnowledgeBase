Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum is 36 to 44 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments and 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam.  Soil reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam.

Billyridge soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and average 5 to 25 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Canderly and Crouch soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F. and both soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Catelli, Ginnis, Shangland,  Spokane, and Usk soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Conconully soils are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days and average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Donavan soils have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Fanal soils have mottles in the lower B and C horizons.  Hellgate soils have 25 to 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Picard soils are very fine sandy loam and fine sandy loam in the Bw horizon.  Rebecca soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.
