    "content": "REMARKS: Soil interpretation record: MT1748. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 7 inches (A and E horizons); a cambic horizon from 7 to 29 inches (Bw and BC horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, BC and C1 horizons); a layer of decomposed welded tuff from 51 to 56 inches (Cr horizon); welded tuff bedrock at 56 inches (R horizon). Bendoh soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Ashy, glassy Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
