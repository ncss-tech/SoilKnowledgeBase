  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beartracker soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic rocks and tuff-breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,700 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

Monolake soils are moderately deep with lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters and have an aridic moisture regime."
