Beaucoup soils have a mollic epipedon, average more than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and are in positions similar to the Birds soils. Belknap, Haymond, Wakeland and Wilbur soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on higher parts of the flood plain or are on narrower and better drained flood plains of adjacent tributary streams. The Petrolia soils average more than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on similar or adjacent parts of the flood plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. The apparent water table ranges from 31 cm (1.0 foot) above to 31 cm (1 foot) below the surface from January through June in drained areas and from 61 cm (2 feet) above to 15 cm (0.5 feet) below the surface from October through September in undrained areas. Flooding ranges from rare to frequent during winter, spring, and after heavy rainfall events. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (1.41 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) in the upper part and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/sec) in the lower part of the series control section. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow (0.2 to 2.0 inches per hour) in the upper part and moderately slow (0.2 to 0.6 inches per hour) in the lower part of the series control section. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. These soils are not dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section during the growing season in normal years."

These soils will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if placement in order Entisols is correct or if new series in order Inceptisols is needed in some areas.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone form the surface to a depth of 56 cm (22 inches) - (Ap and ACg horizons);\nAquic conditions inferred from dominant chroma of 1 in all layers below the surface layer, endosaturation, Aquic moisture regime;\nMesic temperature regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: In Iowa, the native vegetative cover is a mixed herbaceous and woody community commonly inhabited with Silver Maples, Green Ashes, Eastern Cottonwoods, Black Elderberries, Black Willows, Riverbank Grapes, White Cutgrasses, Wood Reedgrasses, Virginia Wildryes, Sensitive Ferns, Wood Nettles, Canadian Clearweeds, Late Goldenrods, and Yellow Jewelweeds.
