  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite and intermediate igneous rock. The Blackett soils are on outwash fans and fan remnants. Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
