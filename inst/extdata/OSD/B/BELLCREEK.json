  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during the winter and spring in normal years. Duration of the high water table is considerably less in drained phases. Potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately high or high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and moderate in the underlying material."
