Idahome soils have greater than 8 mmhos per cm of salinity in their Bk horizons. Nyssaton soils have stratified lake sediments at a depth of 15 to 40 inches.  Pogal soils have more than 40 percent exchangeable sodium within a depth of 30 inches and are greater than 20 inches deep to a calcic horizon.  Barrymore and Portino soils have basalt at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

They formed in loess or silty alluvium.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 12 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 100 to 170 days."

Broncho soils are sandy-skeletal and have a noncalcareous surface layer.  Broxon soils have strongly contrasting textural control sections.  Minidoka soils have an indurated duripan at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Pocatello soils lack a calcic horizon.  Portneuf soils have greater than 20 percent durinodes within the control section.  Scism soils have a weak duripan at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Turbyfill soils are coarse-loamy and lack calcic horizons.  Broncho soils are on terrace breaks.  Broxon soils are on similar landscapes in areas of thinner surface deposits over sandy or gravelly material.  Pocatello soils are on similar landscapes as Bahem and south-facing slopes.  Minidoka, Portneuf, and Scism soils are in higher positions on older landforms. Turbyfill soils are on similar landscapes in areas of more sandy parent material."
