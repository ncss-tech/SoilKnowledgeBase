  "REVDATE": "11/2007",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bordas series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slow permeable soils.  These nearly level soils formed in sandy eolian deposits over loamy sediments in depressions of the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).",
