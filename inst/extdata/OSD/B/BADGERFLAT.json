  "OVERVIEW": "The Badgerflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over till from volcanic rocks. Badgerflat soils are on ground moraines and lava plateau backslopes in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches (1143 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F (6 degrees C).",
