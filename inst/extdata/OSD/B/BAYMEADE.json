  "OVERVIEW": "The Baymeade series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability.  They formed in loamy and sandy marine sediments of the lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 54 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 35 to more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid, unless limed.  Some pedons have extremely acid A and E horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral with value of 4 to 6 with common clean grains that are white or light gray.  Texture of the A horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6 or is neutral with value of 6 to 8.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  The Bh portion of E/Bh horizon or Bh horizon, where present, is granular to massive with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.\nThe E' horizon, where present has hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6 or it is neutral with values of 6 to 8.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of yellow, brown, or gray at depths below 25 inches in some pedons.  A gray matrix may be present in the lower Bt horizons of some pedons.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or fine sandy loam but some pedons are sandy clay loam.  The lower Bt horizon may occur as lamella of sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of yellow, brown, or gray in some pedons.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or in some pedons sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8 or is mottled in shades of these colors. Texture is sand or fine sand or stratified sandy, loamy, or clayey material.  Some pedons have thin discontinuous Bh bodies in the C horizon."

Closely related soils are the Alaga, Eustis, Kureb, Onslow, Seagate, Wagram, and Wakulla series.  All of these soils except Kureb lack irregular intermittent Bh bodies in the E/Bh horizon.  Kureb soils lack argillic horizons.  Onslow soils lack an arenic epipedon and contain gray mottles indicative of wetness in the Bt horizon.  Seagate and Valhalla soils have continuous Bh horizons. Seagate soils have poorer drainage."
