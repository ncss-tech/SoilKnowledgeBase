Birdcanyon and Koehn soils are intermittingly moist near the soil surface following occasional summer convection storms. Brazito, Copia, Pintura, Toquop and University soils have less than 10 percent silt plus clay in the series control section. Also, Pintura soils are mainly noncalcareous throughout. Cajon soils formed in sandy alluvium from dominantly granitic rocks. Hembrillo soils have 20 to 50 percent gypsum in the particle-size control section. Maynard Lake soils have more than 20 percent volcanic ash. Moapa soils have a paralithic contact at 50 to 100 centimeters. Yturbide soils average 15 to 35 percent gravel in the series control section."

Elevations are 520 to 1220 meters (1,700 to 4,000 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 180 centimeters (3 to 7 inches); mean annual air temperature is 16 to 21 degrees C. (61 to 69 degrees F.)., and the frost-free season is 230 to 300 days."
