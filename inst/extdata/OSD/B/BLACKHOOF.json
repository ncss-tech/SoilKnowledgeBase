  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackhoof series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in a thin layer of organic materials atop a friable mantle of loamy, glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial deposit and the underlying firm loamy till on moraines, till plains and lake washed till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters.",
