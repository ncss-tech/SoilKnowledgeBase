  "OVERVIEW": "The Barremills series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on hills.   These soils are on footslopes, swales and drainways and formed in a thin layer of slope alluvium over loess.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  The content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Coarse fragments are absent.  Redoximorphic features and saturation occur at depths of 40 to 60 inches.   Saturation occurs for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.  Saturation may occurs within 40 inches in some pedons but is present less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe AB horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."
