    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 48 inches.  The upper 5 to 15 inches of this epipedon is slope alluvium.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  The content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Coarse fragments are absent.  Redoximorphic features and saturation occur at depths of 40 to 60 inches.   Saturation occurs for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.  Saturation may occurs within 40 inches in some pedons but is present less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe AB horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."
