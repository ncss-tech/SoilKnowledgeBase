They formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, slope alluvium, and eolian material derived from sandstone. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevation is 5,500 to 7,300 feet. Mean annual air temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 14 inches. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
