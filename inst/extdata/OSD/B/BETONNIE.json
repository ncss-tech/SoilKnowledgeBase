  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Betonnie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and eolian sediments derived from sandstone on fan terraces, mesas, cuestas, valley sides, hills, ridges and plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
