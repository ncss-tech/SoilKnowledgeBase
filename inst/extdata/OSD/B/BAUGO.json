  "OVERVIEW": "The Baugo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash overlying loamy dense till on till plains. They are deep or very deep to dense till. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
