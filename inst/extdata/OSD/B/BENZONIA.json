  "OVERVIEW": "The Benzonia series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy deposits on outwash plains, moraines, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
