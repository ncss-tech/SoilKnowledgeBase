  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of volcanic ash influence and depth to the 2C horizon is 14 to 32 inches.  Depth to the 3C horizon is 40 to 60 inches.  By weighted average, the upper part of the particle-size control section has 5 to 25 percent pebbles, and the lower part has 35 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  Some pedons have an E horizon\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, 2 through 6 dry.  It is very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Rock fragments average from 5 to 25 percent, although subhorizons contain up to 35 percent.  It is loam, gravelly loam, clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Thin strata of sandy loam are in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Birchbay soils are wave-reworked glaciomarine drift plains at elevations of 50 to 350 feet.  The soils formed in volcanic ash and loess over glaciofluvial deposits and glaciomarine drift.  Birchbay soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 200 days."

Clipper and Hale soils have mottles with a chroma of 2 or less within 15 cm below the spodic horizon.  Hale soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section.  Kickerville soils are loamy-skeletal and well drained.  Labounty and Whitehorn soils have an aquic moisture regime.  In addition, Labounty soils are fine-loamy and Whitehorn soils are coarse-loamy.  Tromp soils have grayish mottles within 30 inches of the surface and have less than 35 percent fock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Whatcom soils are fine-loamy."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Andic Xerochrepts to coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 8 inches, a spodic horizon from 8 to 24 inches, and a lithologic change to sandy-skeletal material at 24 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon, but does have micro morphological criteria, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
