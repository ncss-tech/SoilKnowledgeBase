  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches, and depth to the fragipan is 18 to 40 inches.  Chert content is less than 5 percent in the A and upper Bt horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon above the fragipan, 5 to 65 percent in the fragipan, and 35 to 75 percent in the residuum.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and dominantly chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction is medium acid to extremely acid except where limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma that dominantly is 2 but ranges to 1.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 2Btx horizon generally has hue of 10YR, but includes 7.5YR and 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Mottles have similar hue and value as the matrix but chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or their cherty, very cherty, or extremely cherty analogues.  Thick clay films, flows, or plugs are common.  Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has mottled colors with hues of 10YR to 10R, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is very cherty or extremely cherty analogues of silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Soils in similar families are the Gerald, Lebanon, Plato, Robertsville, and Union soils.  Gerald soils have a thicker darker colored surface horizon.  Lebanon and Union soils have higher chroma throughout their profiles.  Plato soils have higher chroma in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Robertsville soils have lower clay maxima."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bado soils are on level or nearly level flat areas on broad upland ridgetops.  Slope gradients commonly are less than 2 percent, but range to 3 percent.  The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loess over residuum from cherty limestone or dolomite which commonly is underlain by reddish clayey paleosols.  The fragipan formed in the old erosion surface at the contact of the contrasting materials."

Creldon, Keeno, Needleye, Nixa, Viraton, and Wilderness soils lack gray colors just below the surface horizon and commonly are on more sloping ridgetops and side slopes.  Gerald soils are on nearly level uplands.  Lebanon soils are on more sloping ridgetops.  Plato soils are on similar or more sloping ridgetops."
