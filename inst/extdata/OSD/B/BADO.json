  "OVERVIEW": "The Bado series consists of poorly drained soils that have a fragipan at a depth of 18 to 40 inches.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess over clayey residuum from cherty limestone or dolomite.  Permeability is slow above the fragipan, very slow in the fragipan, and slow or moderate below the fragipan.  These soils are on uplands and slope gradients commonly are less than 2 percent but range to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.",
