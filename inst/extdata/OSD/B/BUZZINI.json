  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buzzini soils occur on broad ridges and upper slopes of hill s and mountains. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 62 to 576 meters (203 to 1,890 feet). The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metasedimentary rocks. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2286 to 3302 millimeters (90 to 130 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 centimeters (A horizon)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 200 centimeters (BA, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 & CBt horizons)\n3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of less than 35 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon\n4. Humult feature  greater than 22 kilograms per square meter of organic carbon to a depth of 1 meter\n5. Palehumult features - Clay remains at least 85 percent of its maximum to a depth of 200 centimeters\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 28 to 78 centimeters, averages 41 percent clay, by weight, and 13 percent rock fragments, by volume.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The Trailhead type pedon, a similar soil, is field sample number S83-CA-12-01, analyzed at Oregon State University and at NSSL. Backup samples S83-CA-12-02 and S83-CA-12-03 were analyzed for mineralogy class at NSSL. University of California samples 60-CA-12-17X and 60-CA-12-18X were collected for the Soil-Vegetation Survey in Redwood National Park.\nSoil classified using the 11th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNasis User Pedon ID: 07CA605345\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
