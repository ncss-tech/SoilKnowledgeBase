  "OVERVIEW": "The Buzzini series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metasedimentary rocks. Buzzini soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2413 millimeters (95 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metasedimentary rocks. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2286 to 3302 millimeters (90 to 130 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F).

Argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 200 centimeters (BA, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 & CBt horizons)\n3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of less than 35 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon\n4. Humult feature  greater than 22 kilograms per square meter of organic carbon to a depth of 1 meter\n5. Palehumult features - Clay remains at least 85 percent of its maximum to a depth of 200 centimeters\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 28 to 78 centimeters, averages 41 percent clay, by weight, and 13 percent rock fragments, by volume.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The Trailhead type pedon, a similar soil, is field sample number S83-CA-12-01, analyzed at Oregon State University and at NSSL. Backup samples S83-CA-12-02 and S83-CA-12-03 were analyzed for mineralogy class at NSSL. University of California samples 60-CA-12-17X and 60-CA-12-18X were collected for the Soil-Vegetation Survey in Redwood National Park.\nSoil classified using the 11th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNasis User Pedon ID: 07CA605345\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
