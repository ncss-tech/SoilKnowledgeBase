  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Battlement soils are usually dry in the moisture control section during the month of June.  The soil is calcareous to the surface.  Reaction is commonly slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout, but is strongly alkaline below a depth of 10 inches in some pedons.  The particle-size control section is typically a stratified loam, silt loam, and clay loam with thin layers of fine sandy loam, silty clay loam and sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin layers of fine pebbles or sandy material.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and has 15 to 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  EC ranges from 0 to 16 ds/m."

They formed in calcareous alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 16 inches and is distributed evenly throughout the year.  About half of the precipitation falls between April and September with June and July receiving the least amount of precipitation when the soil temperature is 41 degrees F. and above.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 75 to 105 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches.  Ustic Torrifluvents features - have an aridic moisture regime that borders on an ustic regime; have an organic carbon content that decreases irregularly with increasing depth; stratification of materials is with thin sandy layers.  There are saline phases of this soil.\nLast updated by the state 5/94.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
