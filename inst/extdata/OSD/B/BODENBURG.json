  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 40 to over 60 inches.  Texture of the loess mantle is silt loam with less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the loess cap and slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizons have moist hue from 10YR through 2.5Y; value moist from 2 through 4; and chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Occasional thin strata of darker colors (buried O horizons and charcoal) occur throughout these horizons.   Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam with occasional strata of fine sand.\nThe buried Bw/C horizons have two dominant color groups.  The B portion has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist from 4 through 6.  The C portion has has hue from 10YR through 5Y; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Occasional thin strata of darker colors (buried O horizons and charcoal) occur throughout these horizons.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bwb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist from 4 to 6; Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BC or 2BC horizons, when present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.  Coarse fragments range from 20 to 45 percent and include rounded gravel and cobble.\nThe 2C horizons, when present, have variegated colors.  Textures include sand, coarse sand and loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent includes rounded gravel, cobble and few stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bodenburg soils are on broad terraces bordering glacial rivers and on adjacent low hills and outwash plains.  They formed in a loess mantle overlying glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel.  Bodenburg soils receive an annual increment of fresh loess.  The loess consists of glacial flour from active glacial outwash plains.  The climate is transitional maritime-continental.  Mean annual temperature is 35 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 17 inches."
