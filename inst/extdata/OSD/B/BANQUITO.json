  "OVERVIEW": "The Banquito series consists of moderately deep to basalt, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvial materials over residuum derived from basalt. Banquito soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
