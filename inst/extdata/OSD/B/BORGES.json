  "OVERVIEW": "The Borges series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in old clayey alluvium.  Borges soils are in drainageways and concave positions on rolling uplands and high terraces.  Slope is 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
