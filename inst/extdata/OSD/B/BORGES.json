Depth to the bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has distinct or prominent mottles and is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay and averages 45 to 60 percent clay to a depth of 40 inches or more.  Below a depth of 40 inches, the texture is clay loam, clay or silty clay with 0 to 35 percent weathered gravel."
