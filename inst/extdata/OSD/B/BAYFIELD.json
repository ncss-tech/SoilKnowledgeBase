  "OVERVIEW": "The Bayfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine textured alluvium weathered from sandstone and shale. Bayfield soils are in valleys and drainageways and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 8.8 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 355 mm.",
