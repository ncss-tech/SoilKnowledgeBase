  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacknat series consists of very shallow over soft bedrock, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand derived mainly from limestone. Blacknat soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are from 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 7 inches, mean annual temperature is about 66 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 180 to 300 days."
