  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Blacknat soils are on stream terraces. They formed in eolian sand derived mainly from limestone over a petrocalcic horizon. Slopes are from 2 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,000 feet. The climate is arid with warm winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 7 inches, mean annual temperature is about 66 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 180 to 300 days."
