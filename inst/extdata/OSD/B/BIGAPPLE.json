  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the sandy dredge material is greater than 100 cm and is sourced from coastal waterways, bays, or rivers. Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 86 cm. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent. Shell fragments are present in some pedons. Human artifacts fragments range from 0 to 10 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately alkaline throughout. Iron accumulations are relict and may be present on bedding planes in the subsoil and substratum horizons.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Textures and their gravelly analogs include sandy loam, loamy sand, very fine sand, or coarser. The horizon is commonly single grained, but ranges to granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is loose.\nThe ^E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Textures and their gravelly analogs include very fine sand or coarser. The horizon is massive or single grained, but ranges to granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is loose.\nThe ^Bw horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Textures and their gravelly analogs include very fine sand or coarser. The horizon is massive or single grained. Some pedons have weak very fine subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^C horizons have hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6. Textures and their gravelly analogs include very fine sand or coarser. The horizon is massive or single grain. Consistence is loose or very friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bigapple soils are on nearly level to very steep artificially created or modified landforms. These soils formed in human-transported soil material from dredging activities of nearby shorelines, waterways, bays or rivers. The human-transported soil material is relatively clean of human refuse and contains less than 20 percent gravel. Shell fragments are present in some pedons. Slope ranges from 0 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1325 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barren, Breeze, Fortress, Hooksan, Jamaica, Gravesend, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, Sandyhook, Verrazano, and Westbrook soils. The moderately well drained Fortress soils, somewhat poorly drained Barren soils, and poorly drained Jamaica soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Gravesend soils contain more than 35 percent human artifacts and/or rock fragments in the control section. Verrazano soils have a contrasting particle size class within 100 cm from soil surface. Hooksan soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. Ipswich, Pawcatuck, Matunuck, and Westbrook soils formed in organic soil materials subject to very frequent tidal flooding. Sandyhook soils formed in sandy marine deposits subject to tidal flooding. Breeze soils also contain 10 to 34 percent human artifacts."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: This soil is well to excessively drained. The potential for surface runoff is very low to low on vegetated slopes less than 20 percent, and medium on vegetated slopes 20 percent and greater. The potential for surface runoff is one class more rapid where the soil is unvegetated or the surface is poorly protected from erosion. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the surface and very high in the subsoil and substratum."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Redoximorphic features in the typical pedon are considered relict features.  Water table monitoring at the type location did not indicate an active water table within observed depths.\nSome Bigapple soils feature one or more thin layers that meet diagnostic criteria for a placic horizon (i.e., a root-limiting pan cemented by iron or iron and manganese).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 cm. (^Au and ^E horizons)\n2. Psamments - the zone from 25 to 100 cm is fine sand or sand and averages less than 35 percent rock fragments (^Bw, ^C1, and ^C2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Type location sampled as S1995NY047001 for full characterization. Pedon analyzed by the KSSL, Lincoln, NE.  Additional full characterization samples include S1998NY047001 and S1998NY047010. Characterization data for Bigapple and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
