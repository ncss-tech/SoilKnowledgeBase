  "OVERVIEW": "The Baxtrum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
