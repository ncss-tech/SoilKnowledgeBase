  "OVERVIEW": "The Bruner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks. These soils are on eroded fan remnant sideslopes. Slopes are 35 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
