  "OVERVIEW": "The Brid series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
