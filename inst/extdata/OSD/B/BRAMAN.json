  "OVERVIEW": "The Braman series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These soils are on alluvial plains of major streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in).",
