  "OVERVIEW": "The Benwy series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loess, alluvium and colluvium over a duripan. Benwy soils are on structural benches, hillslopes, footslopes and toeslopes of plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F. These soils are dry more than half the time in the moisture control section when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 40 degrees F. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 28 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles larger than very fine sand in the fine earth fraction and has 0 to 15 percent rounded basalt gravel and cobbles. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 15 inches in thickness. Depth to secondary lime deposits range from 24 to 38 inches. Depth to the duripan ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches and is underlain by basalt, fanglomerate, sandstone, or siltstone.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Texture is silt loam or loam and averages 0 to 10 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Texture is loam, silt loam, or clay loam and has 0 to 20 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral, slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk or Bk horizon has a value of 4 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist. Texture is a loam, silt loam, or clay loam and has 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Clay content is typically less than 28 percent, but some pedons range up to 35 percent immediately above the duripan.\nSome pedons have a very gravelly loam Bkq horizon above the indurated duripan."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benwy soils are on structural benches, highly dissected fan terraces, hillslopes, backslopes, summits, and footslopes and toeslopes of plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. These soils formed in loess, colluvium, and alluvium from loess and basalt over cemented gravels and cobbles underlain by basalt, sandstone, or siltstone. These soils occur in depositional positions at elevations of 1,200 to 3,400 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

Cheviot and Clerf soils are loamy-skeletal. Clerf and Wipple soils are clayey-skeletal. Renslow soils lack an indurated 2Ckqm layer and are coarse-silty. Vantage soils are clayey-skeletal with a lithic contact at 10 to 20 inches. Bakeoven soils are loamy-skeletal with a lithic contact at 4 to 10 inches. Selah soils are 20 to 40 inches to an indurated 2Bkqm. Terlan soils are 10 to 20 inches to an indurated duripan."
