  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigsheep series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, sedimentary plains, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
