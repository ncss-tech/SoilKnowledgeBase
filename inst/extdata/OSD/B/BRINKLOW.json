  "STATES": "MD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brinklow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  They formed partly in slope creep materials and partly in residuum weathered from phyllite and schist in the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

Rock fragments of veined quartz and phyllite range from 5 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons and from 35 to 50 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8.  They are loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8. They are loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr (bedrock) horizon can be dug with hand tools; The R (hard bedrock) horizon cannot be dug with hand tools."

The very deep, well drained Chester, Glenelg, and Manor soils are on nearby landscapes.  Brandywine, Hyattstown, Linganore, and Mt. Airy soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Codorus and Hatboro soils do not have a Bt horizon and are on floodplains.  Glenville soils have a fragipan, are moderately well or somewhat poorly drained, and are around th heads of drainageways."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Brinklow series has previously been included in the Linganore, Urbana, Chester, Glenelg, and Manor series.  The Linganore series is loamy-skeletal, Urbana is classified as an Aquic Fragiudalf, and Chester, Glenelg, and Manor soils are very deep to bedrock.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 19 inches (Bt horizon).\nc. Paralithic contact - the zone from 25 to 35 inches (Cr horizon).\nd. Lithic contact - at 35 inches (R horizon).\nAdditional Data:  Laboratory data on two pedons are available from the University of Maryland, Department of Agronomy, Soil Characterization Lab."
