  "OVERVIEW": "The Boyett series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in arkosic sandstone and old alluvium weathered from red sedimentary rock.  Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid.  Boyett soils are on upland hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
