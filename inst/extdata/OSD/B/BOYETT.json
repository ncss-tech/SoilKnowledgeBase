  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Calcium carbonate equivalent and exchangeable sodium is less than two percent throughout the soil.  Base saturation ranges from 82 to 100 percent in the argillic horizon.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume and are mainly less than 2 inches in diameter.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F. and the mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F.  Carbonates range in depth from 26 to 48 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma or 1 or 2.  The upper 7 inches when mixed has moist mollic colors.  Reaction is slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Reaction is slightly acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Clay ranges from 12 to 18 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is typically loam, sandy loam, or coarse sand.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in parent materials locally transported from sedimentary arkosic beds of the Fountain and Lyons Formations or in red aeolian material over sandstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F, and the summer temperature ranges 58 to 64 degrees F."

The Paunsaugunt soils are underlain by limestone at a shallow depth.  The Sphinx soils are shallow and occur on steeper uplands."
