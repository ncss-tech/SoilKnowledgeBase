  "OVERVIEW": "The Blizzard series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Blizzard soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
