The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from\nabout mid July to mid October (75 to 90 days).  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about mid May to mid November (180 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about mid June to mid October.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/4 or 6/4.  The moist color is 10YR 3/6, 3/3, 3/4, or 4/3.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/6, 7/3, 7/4, 6/6 or 7.5YR 5/4.  The moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/6, 6/4, 3/6, 4/6, 5/4 or 7.5YR 3/4.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loam.
