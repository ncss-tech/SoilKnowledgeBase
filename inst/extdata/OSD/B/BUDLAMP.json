Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from granite, gneiss, monzonite, quartzite, granodiorite and other igneous and metamorphic rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
