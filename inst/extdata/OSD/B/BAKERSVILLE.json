  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bakersville series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils in depressional areas of the flatwoods of peninsular Florida.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",
