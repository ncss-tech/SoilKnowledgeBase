  "OVERVIEW": "The Boquillas series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed from pyroclastic rock.  Boquillas soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
