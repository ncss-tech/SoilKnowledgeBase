  "OVERVIEW": "The Becker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of postglacial alluvial sediments and in the underlying sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 780 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
