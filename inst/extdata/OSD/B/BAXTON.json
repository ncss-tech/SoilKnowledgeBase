  "OVERVIEW": "The Baxton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, or residuum from coarse grained igneous rocks. They are on mountain slopes, hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
