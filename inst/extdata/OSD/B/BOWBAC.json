  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to soft sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous carbonate accumulation ranges from 10 to 35 inches, and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 35 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are soft sandstone channers or semirounded gravel.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in some or all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are loamy fine sand, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction is typically neutral or slightly alkaline but ranges to moderately alkaline in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  In pedons where mollic colors are present in this horizon, the layer is too thin to meet the requirements for a mollic epipedon. Texture is  sandy clay loam with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Clay ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction is typically slightly alkaline but may range from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is typically sandy loam or sandy clay loam but may be fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Carbonates range from 6 to 14 percent. This horizon does not meet the requirements of a diagnostic calcic.  Discontinuous horizons with greater than 15 percent carbonates occur in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline with less than 15 percent ESP.\nThe Cr is a paralithic contact to calcareous, argillaceous sandstone.  This material is weakly consolidated and does restrict the movement of water and, therefore, roots.  Interbedded shales may be present in some areas and may form the contact."
