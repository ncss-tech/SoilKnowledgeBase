    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to soft sandstone range from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to hard sandstone normally ranges from about 40 to 60 inches.  Fragments of soft and hard sandstone range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and up to 35 percent in the C horizon.  The soil is extremely acid to strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A and E horizons are loam, very fine sandy loam; fine sandy loam or rarely silt loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is  loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, red or yellow.\nThe BC or C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.

Bailegap soils have bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Gunstock soils have up to 55 percent fragments of siltstone and phyllite in the solum.  The Alonzville, Jefferson, Lonewood, Marr, Riney, Sassafras and Sunnyside soils are more than 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Lily soils are similar except they have hard bedrock within 40 inches.  Gilpin soils have mixed mineralogy and contain up to 40 rock fragments that are mostly shale. Hartsells and Linker soils have a thermic temperature regime and have hard bedrock within 40 inches."
