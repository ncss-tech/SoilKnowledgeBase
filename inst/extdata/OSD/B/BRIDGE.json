Chutum, Laverkin, Sotim, Turney and Weedpatch soils are very deep. Deltajo soils are moderately deep to sandstone and siltstone and have hues redder than 5YR. In addition, Weedpatch soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November."

Bridge soils formed in slope alluvium in part from basalt and limestone and in part from volcanic ash and tuff. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 41 degrees F., and mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F."
