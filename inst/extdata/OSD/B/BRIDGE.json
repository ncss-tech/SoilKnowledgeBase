  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bridge series are moderately deep, well drained moderately permeable soils formed in slope alluvium in part from basalt and limestone and in part from volcanic ash and tuff. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees.",
