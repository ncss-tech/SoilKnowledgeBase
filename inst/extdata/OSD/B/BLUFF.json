  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Where the thickness of the A horizon is less than 10 inches, the Bkg1 horizon has color value of 3.  Where color value of the Bkg1 horizon is 3, the combined thickness of the A and Bkg1 horizon ranges from 11 to 24 inches.  Base saturation is 50 percent or more in all horizons.  Some pedons have fractured limestone bedrock below 60 inches.  Reaction of the A horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline and the Bkg horizons range from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2 and is up to 5 inches thick.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray or brown range from none to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe upper part of the Bk horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from none to common.  Calcium carbonate masses or nodules range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe lower part of the Bk horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1; or is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Calcium carbonate masses or nodules range from common to many.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2, or there is no dominant color and is a mix of these colors. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to sandy clay, and is commonly mixed.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has the same colors as the C horizon.  Shell fragments range from none to many.  Texture is fine sand, or sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 54 to 64 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

Anclote and Astor soils are on similar to lower positions and are sandy throughout.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Eaton soils are on similar to higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  The poorly drained Eureka soils are on similar positions but do not have mollic epipedons.  Terra Ceia soils are on similar to lower positions and are organic."
