  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar series are the Goss and Snead series.  Goss soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have argillic horizons.  Snead soils have fewer rock fragments and are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brussels soils are on side slopes and foot slopes of hills. Slopes range from 14 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone or dolomite with interbedded shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 45 inches."
