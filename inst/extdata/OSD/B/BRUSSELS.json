  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. RLT",
  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "IN,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brussels series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone or dolomite with interbedded shale.  Permeability is moderately slow.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 14 to 90 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar series are the Goss and Snead series.  Goss soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have argillic horizons.  Snead soils have fewer rock fragments and are moderately deep to bedrock."
