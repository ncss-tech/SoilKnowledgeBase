    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were mapped as Sorrento in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated by lacking lime in the lower A and in the C horizon which is typical of the Sorrento soils.   pH determined by colormetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Organic carbon determined by Walkely-Black digestion method. Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HCl.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nLast revised by the state on 4/85.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
