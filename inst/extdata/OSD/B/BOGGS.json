  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 60 inches or more deep.  The moisture control section is moist all year in most years and is saturated from December to March in some years.  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Organic matter is 0.1 to 0.6 percent in the surface layer and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  Most soil horizons have 2 to 8.4 percent soluble salt.  The soil is commonly effervescent throughout.  Some pedons are noneffervescent to a depth of 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7.2; 5Y 5/1, 5/2 or 6/2 and moist color of 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2; 5Y 4/1 or 4/2.  It is commonly sandy loam, fine sandy loam or less commonly coarse sandy loam.  This horizon is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2; or 5Y 6/2 and moist color of 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; or 5Y 5/3.  Moist mottles are faint to prominent and have color of 10YR 4/6; 2.5Y 5/4; 5Y 4/2; N 5/0; or 5B 6/1.  This horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or less commonly coarse sandy loam.  Buried horizons are thin and range from sand to clay loam.  Some pedons lack buried horizons.  Durinodes range from 0 to 10 percent in lower part of the C horizon.  This horizon is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."
