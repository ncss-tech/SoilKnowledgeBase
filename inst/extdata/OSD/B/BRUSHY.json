  "OVERVIEW": "The Brushy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone on mountain summits, shoulders, and side slopes. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 38 inches, and average annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
