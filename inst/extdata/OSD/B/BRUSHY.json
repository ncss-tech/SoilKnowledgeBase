The Grimsley, Joppa and Oriskany soils are in a related family and may become competitors as their classification is updated to the ninth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The Pocono, Joppa and Oriskany soils are all very deep to a lithic contact. The Grimsley soils are deep to a lithic contact."

They are on mountain summits, shoulders, and side slopes. Slope gradients range from 2 to 70 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."
