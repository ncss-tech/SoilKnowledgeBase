  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. The soil between depths of about 12 to 36 inches is usually moist in some or all parts shortly after the first of November and stays moist until sometime in May, and is dry the rest of the year. The organic matter ranges from 1 to 4 percent to a depth of 10 inches and decreases regularly with depth. The soil is neutral to strongly acid. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand throughout the profile, and is not stratified.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray, dark gray, gray, very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, dark brown and brown in 10YR hue and brown or dark brown in 7.5YR hue.\nThe C horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, light brownish gray, light gray, pale brown, or very pale brown in 10YR hue and brown in 7.5YR hue. In some pedons there is a B horizon separating the A horizon and the C horizon. Some pedons also have a few faint lamellae or a few small dark reddish brown concretions. Other pedons rest on firm loamy terrace deposits at depths of 48 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The climate is subhumid mesothermal with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 35 inches. Average annual temperature is 57 degrees to 60 degrees F.; average January temperature is about 50 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 62 degrees F. The average frost-free season is about 250 to 350 days."
