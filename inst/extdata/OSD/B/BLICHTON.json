  "OVERVIEW": "The Blichton series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slow or slowly permeable soils on uplands in central Florida.  They formed in thick beds of loamy and sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Bivans, Boardman, and Flemington have less than 20 inches of sandy surface and subsurface layers.  In addition, Bivans and Flemington soils are on similar positions and have smectitic control sections, and Boardman soils are on similar to lower positions.  Kanapaha soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  The well drained Kendrick soils are on similar to higher positions and have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil.  The somewhat poorly drained Lochloosa and Nobleton soils are on similar to higher positions and contain less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil.  The very poorly drained Martel soils are on lower positions, have smectitic subsoils, and have less than 20 inches of sandy surface and subsurface horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained Micanopy soils are on similar to higher positions, have mixed mineralogy clayey subsoils, and have less than 20 inches of sandy surface and subsurface horizons.  In addition, Nobleton soils have clayey mixed control sections. Wacahoota soils are on similar to lower positions and have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil and have 15 to 35 percent gravel, by volume in the control section."

In the drier season it recedes to depths of more than 40 inches.  Soils that have more than 2 percent slopes are saturated during wet seasons due primarily to seepage.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
