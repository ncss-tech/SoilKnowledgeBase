Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizons and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the Bt, Btv, BC, and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4.  Pebbles of ironstone range from few to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 or 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or gray range from none to common.  Pebbles of ironstone range from few to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, and red range from none to common.  Pebbles of ironstone range from none to common.

Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray range from none to common.  Content of plinthite ranges from 0 to 4 percent, by volume.  Pebbles of ironstone range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btv horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray range from none to common.  Content of plinthite ranges from 5 to 25 percent, by volume, at depths of 30 to 48 inches below the soil surface.  Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with lenses of coarser textured material.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same range of colors and redoximorphic features as the BC horizon.  Fragments of siliceous rock or leached phosphatic rock 2 to 76 mm in size is in some pedons, but comprise less than 5 percent by volume.

Bivans, Boardman, and Flemington have less than 20 inches of sandy surface and subsurface layers.  In addition, Bivans and Flemington soils are on similar positions and have smectitic control sections, and Boardman soils are on similar to lower positions.  Kanapaha soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  The well drained Kendrick soils are on similar to higher positions and have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil.  The somewhat poorly drained Lochloosa and Nobleton soils are on similar to higher positions and contain less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil.  The very poorly drained Martel soils are on lower positions, have smectitic subsoils, and have less than 20 inches of sandy surface and subsurface horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained Micanopy soils are on similar to higher positions, have mixed mineralogy clayey subsoils, and have less than 20 inches of sandy surface and subsurface horizons.  In addition, Nobleton soils have clayey mixed control sections. Wacahoota soils are on similar to lower positions and have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil and have 15 to 35 percent gravel, by volume in the control section."

In the drier season it recedes to depths of more than 40 inches.  Soils that have more than 2 percent slopes are saturated during wet seasons due primarily to seepage.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
