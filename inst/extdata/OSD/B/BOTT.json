The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the buried soil material is 20 to 30 inches and has a field estimated clay content of 10 to 20 percent.  The upper mantle of the soil contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregate, and has a field estimated clay content of 5 to 15 percent.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist, 5 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry in the upper part and 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry in the lower part.  It contains 5 to 25 percent gravel.  It is ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist and 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.
