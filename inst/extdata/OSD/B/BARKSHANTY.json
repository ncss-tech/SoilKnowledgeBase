  "OVERVIEW": "The Barkshanty series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from schist or phyllite rock types.  Barkshanty soils are on broad ridgetops and stable benches on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
