The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay and has 35 to 70 percent total rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is greater than 60 inches.  The solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is channery loam with 20 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent channers and 0 to 5 percent flagstones.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is channery loam, channery clay loam, or very channery clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 15 to 35 percent channers  and 0 to 10 percent flagstones.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from schist and phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 200 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
