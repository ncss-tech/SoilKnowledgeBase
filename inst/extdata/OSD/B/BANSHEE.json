  "OVERVIEW": "The Banshee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from prehistoric lakes and marshes and fan alluvium.  Banshee soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
