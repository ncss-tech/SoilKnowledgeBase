  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bosquecito soils are on natural levees and crevasse splays on flood plains of valley floors with intermittent streams.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist, and Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Cuyamungue soils are sandy-skeletal, have seasonal high water tables between 5 and 8 feet, and occur on low flood plains below Bosquecito.  Jaralosa soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have seasonal high water tables between 3.5 and 5 feet from the soil surface, and occur on low flood plains.  Mirada soils are hydric, have seasonal high water tables near the soil surface, and occur on low flood plains."

These soils are subject to occasional, extremely brief periods of flooding between July and September.  Floodwaters have low velocity and are generally less than two feet deep.  A seasonal high water table is present between 2.0 and 3.5 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 1 inch. (A horizon)\nFluventic feature - Alluvial stratification and an irregular organic-carbon distribution.\nOxyaquic feature - Aquic conditions (endosaturation and reduction) in all horizons between 26 and 64 inches.  Reduced iron ions are indicated by the horizons producing a strong red color after spot application of alpha, alpha-dipyridyl in a neutral, 1-normal ammonium acetate solution.  An anaerobic state is inferred by the stale, musty odor of the Cg horizons, which indicates the decomposition of organic matter in the absence of oxygen.\nDepleted matrix - The presence of a low chroma matrix which contains reduced iron, but does not change color on exposure to air. (Cg1, Cg2 Cg3, and Cg4 horizons)\nNote:  This soil does not meet the Criteria for Hydric Soils as defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (1994).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
