  "OVERVIEW": "The Bosquecito series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Bosquecito soils are on flood plains of valley floors with intermittent streams.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 1 inch. (A horizon)\nFluventic feature - Alluvial stratification and an irregular organic-carbon distribution.\nOxyaquic feature - Aquic conditions (endosaturation and reduction) in all horizons between 26 and 64 inches.  Reduced iron ions are indicated by the horizons producing a strong red color after spot application of alpha, alpha-dipyridyl in a neutral, 1-normal ammonium acetate solution.  An anaerobic state is inferred by the stale, musty odor of the Cg horizons, which indicates the decomposition of organic matter in the absence of oxygen.\nDepleted matrix - The presence of a low chroma matrix which contains reduced iron, but does not change color on exposure to air. (Cg1, Cg2 Cg3, and Cg4 horizons)\nNote:  This soil does not meet the Criteria for Hydric Soils as defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (1994)."
