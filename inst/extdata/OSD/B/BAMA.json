  "OVERVIEW": "The Bama series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils in the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A). They formed thick beds of loamy marine and fluvial sediments on high stream or marine terraces. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F) and the average annual precipitation is about 1600 millimeters (63 inches). Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, Ap, E, BE, EB, BA and AB horizons except where the surface has been limed. Reaction in the Bt, BC and C horizons is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.

Mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red appear to be relict redoximorphic features and range from none to common in the lower part. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Some pedons have a thin subhorizon with texture of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the upper part.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Bt horizon. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red that appear to be relict redoximorphic features range from none to common. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present in some pedons below a depth of 150 centimeters (60 inches) is massive and is commonly stratified.

Closely related series include the Norfolk, Orangeburg and Ruston series.\nIroncity soils are in the Highland Rim and Pennyroyal Major Land Resource area (MLRA 122). Minvale soils are in the Southern Blue Ridge Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 130B). Pikeville soils are on more dissected uplands and have 15 to 35 percent, by volume, coarse fragments in the profile. Norfolk soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and have yellower subsoils. Orangeburg soils are on similar positions but have less than 20 percent silt in the control section. Ruston soils are on similar positions but are bisequal."
