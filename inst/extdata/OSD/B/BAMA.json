  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. Percent by volume of ironstone concretions and/or quartz gravel, 2 to 20 mm in diameter, ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the solum. Silt content of the particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 46 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, Ap, E, BE, EB, BA and AB horizons except where the surface has been limed. Reaction in the Bt, BC and C horizons is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BE, EB, BA, or AB horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  In some pedons, below a depth of about 40 inches, it has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red appear to be relict redoximorphic features and range from none to common in the lower part. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin subhorizon with texture of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the upper part.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Bt horizon. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red that appear to be relict redoximorphic features range from none to common. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, present in some pedons below a depth of 60 inches is massive and is commonly stratified. It has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red that appear to be relict redoximorphic features range from none to common. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or the gravelly analogues of these textures."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ironcity, Minvale and Pikeville series.  Closely related series include the Norfolk, Orangeburg and Ruston series.\nIroncity soils are in the Highland Rim and Pennyroyal Major Land Resource area (MLRA 122). Minvale soils are in the Southern Blue Ridge Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 130B). Pikeville soils are on more dissected uplands and have 15 to 35 percent, by volume, coarse fragments in the profile.  Norfolk soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and have yellower subsoils. Orangeburg soils are on similar positions but have less than 20 percent silt in the control section. Ruston soils are on similar positions but are bisequal."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bama soils are on high terraces or uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain. They formed in thick beds of loamy fluvial or marine sediments. The climate is humid subtropical. Slopes are commonly 0 to 8 percent, but range up to 15 percent. The average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 56 to 65 inches."

Benndale and McLaurin soils are on similar or slightly lower positions and have coarse-loamy control sections. Lucedale soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are rhodic. Malbis soils are on slightly lower positions, have yellower subsoils and are plinthic.
