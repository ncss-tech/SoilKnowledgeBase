The mean annual soil temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or neutral.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.  The profile contains 15 to 30 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, and the acid oxalate aluminum plus one half the acid oxalate iron is 0.40 to 0.80 percent.  Phosphate retention is 15 to 25 percent.\nThe A and AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Organic matter content is less than 1 percent below a depth of about 15 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel-size pumice.  It has 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel-size pumice.  Faint to distinct mottles are present in most pedons due to irrigation.  It is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 20 percent clay."
