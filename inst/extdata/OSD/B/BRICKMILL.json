These soils are continuously saturated with water at a depth of 30 to 40 inches. for 90 or more days in most years. Water tables are a combination of natural conditions and artificially induced high water due to irrigation. The particle-size control section averages 45 to 70 percent sand, 5 to 15 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent rock fragments. The depth to an extremely gravelly or cobbly loamy sand or sand 3C horizon is 40 inches or more.  The upper 10 to 30 inches has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus  iron of 0.25 to 0.7 percent and a moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 g/cc.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is gravelly ashy loam or very cobbly ashy loam.

The Eaglespring and Foggydew soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact.  The Garrison soils are 24 to 36 inches deep to a sand and gravel discontinuity.  Metmill soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice, have aquic conditions at a depth of 20 to 30 inches and have 26 to 34 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Neviot soils have 15 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section, secondary carbonates at a depth of 44 to 60 inches and lack an extremely cobbly or extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand substratum.  Cookcreek and Northstar soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Opportunity are not saturated with water for 90 or more days within 30 to 40 inches.  Peka soils are not saturated with water for 90 or more days within 30 to 40 inches and have a densic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Thuso soils are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice and are not saturated with water.  Wagberg soils are 40 to more than 60 inches deep to bedrock and are not saturated with water for 90 or more days within 30 to 40 inches between mid May and mid October."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brickmill soils are on fan piedmonts characterized by numerous perennial on fan streams, and bar and channel microrelief. Brickmill soils formed in old alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are 1,400 to 1,800 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The irrigation season, which affects water table levels, runs from mid May through mid October. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
