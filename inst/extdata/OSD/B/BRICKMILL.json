  "OVERVIEW": "The Brickmill series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in old alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. Brickmill soils are on piedmont slopes grading from mountain footslopes to basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Brickmill soils formed in old alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are 1,400 to 1,800 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The irrigation season, which affects water table levels, runs from mid May through mid October. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
