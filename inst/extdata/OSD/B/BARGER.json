  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges between 18 to 30 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid. Subrounded fragments of chert and small pebbles 1/8 to 1 inch across range from 5 to 15 percent in the horizons above the fragipan.  Angular fragment of chert up to 5 inches across range from 30 to 70 percent in the fragipan.   The amount generally increases with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E and Ap horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture of the A and E horizons is loam or silt loam.  The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and 5YR in the lower part, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of gray, brown and red.  Some pedons are mottled without a dominant matrix color in the lower part.  The fine earth fraction is loam or clay loam.  The E part, located between pologons, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam.  The 2B  horizon is described with weak prismatic structure; however, some pedons appear to be massive because no structure can be observed."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cane, Ora, Savannah, Sidon and Wax series in the same family and the Beltsville, Bourne, Burketown, Rockaway and Tarklin series is similar families.  The Cane, Ora, Savannah, Sidon and Wax soils do not have a discontinuity within the solum.  In addition, the Cane and Ora soils have subsoils that are redder than 7.5YR.  The Savannah soils do not have chert fragments and formed in marine and fluvial terraces of the Coastal Plains.  The Sidon soils have sandstone bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  The Wax soils formed in alluvial on flood plains.  The Beltsville soils have mixed mineralogy and are mesic.  Bourne soils have mixed mineralogy and contain less than 20 percent coarse fragments.  Burketown soils are mesic and have less than 10 percent coarse fragments throughout.  Rockaway soils have mixed mineralogy, are mesic and formed in glacial till.  Tarklin soils are mesic and formed mostly on footslopes and stream terraces in alluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These gently sloping to sloping soils are on secondary ridgetops of uplands that have received deposition from higher ridges.  They formed in a loamy mantle about 18 to 30 inches thick and the underlying loamy paleosol which has a high lag chert content.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 53 inches near the type location."

Fullerton soils are on adjacent side slopes and ridgetops, have clayey subsoils and less than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout.  The Minvale soils are on foot slopes and benches are fine-loamy, and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout.  Pailo soils are on the moderately steep to steep side slopes and are loamy-skeletal over clayey.  None of the associated soils have a fragipan."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of the Barger soils are used for forest.   A few areas are used for pasture and cultivated crops. Several of the areas currently in forest were cleared but have been allowed to return to forest.  The principal vegetation of the forest is mixed hardwoods of the oak-hickory type and pines."

Data is also available for the control section of two additional pedons:  S84TN-007-005 and S84TN-007-006.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (A, E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 7 to 63 inches (Bt1 to 2Bx2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity - at approximately 21 inches\nFragipan - 31 to 63 inches (2Bx1 and 2Bx2 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
