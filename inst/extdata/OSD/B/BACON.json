  "OVERVIEW": "The Bacon series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  Bacon soils are found on slopes of 0 to 10 percent on floodplains, valley bottoms and terraces of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,100 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
