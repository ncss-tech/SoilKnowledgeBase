  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowns series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in a thin mantle of loess mixed with colluvium from basalt over silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash. Bowns soils are on plains and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Some areas still mapped as the Bowns series have tested high in electrical conductivity in the lower part of the argillic horizon which may indicate the presence of a natric horizon.  Further investigation is needed during the update process.\nThe classification of this pedon has been revised from Xerollic Paleargids to Xeric Paleargids based on revision to Soil Taxonomy."
