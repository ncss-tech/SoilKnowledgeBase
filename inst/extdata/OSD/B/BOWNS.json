These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess mixed with colluvium from basalt over silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 150 days."

Some areas still mapped as the Bowns series have tested high in electrical conductivity in the lower part of the argillic horizon which may indicate the presence of a natric horizon.  Further investigation is needed during the update process.\nThe classification of this pedon has been revised from Xerollic Paleargids to Xeric Paleargids based on revision to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
