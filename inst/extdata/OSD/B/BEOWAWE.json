  "OVERVIEW": "The Beowawe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with surficial mantles of loess and volcanic ash.  Beowawe soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
