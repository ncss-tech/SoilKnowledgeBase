COLE ranges from 0.05 to 0.09 in the argillic horizon but lacks a layer 20 inches or more thick with COLE of 0.09, and the PLE is less than 2.4 inches in upper 50 inches of the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reddish or brownish mottles range from few to many.  Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam, with clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt3 and Bt4 horizons have colors in shades of brown, red, yellow or olive with hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has colors in shades of brown, yellow and olive with or without mottles of these or grayish colors.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils are the Apperson, Benchley, Blum, Durant, Eram, Garton, Kenoma, Parisian, and Summit series.  The Apperson, Benchley, Durant, Kenoma, Parisian and Summit soils are members of a Vertic subgroup.  Also, Apperson soils have bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Benchley and Durant soils are in an ustic moisture regime.  The Blum, Eram and Garton soils have mixed clay mineralogy.  Also, Blum soils are in an ustic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bonham soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  The slope gradient is typically 1 to 3 percent, but ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alkaline clayey and loamy sediments.  Some pedons are interbedded with shaly materials.  The annual temperature ranges from 63 to 66 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 44 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 56 to 70."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crockett, Normangee, and Wilson soils and to a lesser extent the Heiden, Lamar and Lewisville soils.  Crockett, Normangee and Wilson soils lack a mollic epipedon and are classified in a Vertic subgroup.  These soils are on positions similar to the Bonham series.  Lamar and Lewisville soils lack argillic horizons and occur on sloping to steep sideslopes.  In addition, Lamar soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Heiden soils are clayey throughout and are typically on lower sideslopes."
