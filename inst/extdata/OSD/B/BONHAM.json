The Apperson, Benchley, Durant, Kenoma, Parisian and Summit soils are members of a Vertic subgroup.  Also, Apperson soils have bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Benchley and Durant soils are in an ustic moisture regime.  The Blum, Eram and Garton soils have mixed clay mineralogy.  Also, Blum soils are in an ustic moisture regime."

Crockett, Normangee and Wilson soils lack a mollic epipedon and are classified in a Vertic subgroup.  These soils are on positions similar to the Bonham series.  Lamar and Lewisville soils lack argillic horizons and occur on sloping to steep sideslopes.  In addition, Lamar soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Heiden soils are clayey throughout and are typically on lower sideslopes."
