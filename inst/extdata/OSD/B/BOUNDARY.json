This soil is usually moist, but is dry on all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The argillic horizon is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and averages 20 to 35 percent clay.  The control section has 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments.\nThe E horizon, when present, has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.  It is modified by 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 4 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It is heavy silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and is modified by 30 to 40 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon is heavy silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and is modified by 25 to 35 percent pebbles and 10 to 15 percent cobbles. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and is strongly or violently effervescent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is clay loam or silty clay  loam, and is modified by 35 to 45 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is slightly or strongly effervescent."

They are formed in fine-textured calcareous glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent and have planar and complex surfaces.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a mantle of volcanic ash and loess from 1 to 11 inches with an estimated moist bulk density of less than 1.0 g/cc and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 1.0 percent.  A ochric epipedon from the surface to 11 inches, an argillic horizon from 11 to 26 inches, and a calcic horizon from 26 to 41 inches.  The particle-size control section is the entire argillic horizon from 11 to 26 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  CaCO3 equivalent field procedure determined the 2Bk (26 to 41 inches) to be 53 percent and the 2C at 36 percent (41 to 60 inches).  The 2Bk horizon is a calcic horizon and is presumed to be a function of secondary carbonate enrichment in calcareous glacial till.  Whereas, the carbonate value in the 2C horizon is presumed to reflect the inherent carbonate value of the glacial till.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
