The control section has 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments.\nThe E horizon, when present, has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.  It is modified by 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 4 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It is heavy silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and is modified by 30 to 40 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.

A ochric epipedon from the surface to 11 inches, an argillic horizon from 11 to 26 inches, and a calcic horizon from 26 to 41 inches.  The particle-size control section is the entire argillic horizon from 11 to 26 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons)."

The 2Bk horizon is a calcic horizon and is presumed to be a function of secondary carbonate enrichment in calcareous glacial till.  Whereas, the carbonate value in the 2C horizon is presumed to reflect the inherent carbonate value of the glacial till."
