  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact, solum depth, and depth to the base of the cambic horizon range from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the base of the ochric epipedon ranges from 1 to 10 inches. Rock fragments are of shale or siltstone lithology. Soft shale fragments are common in the series control section. The solum is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe BE horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4 with subhorizons of 1 or 2 chroma in the lower part of some pedons. It is dominantly silty clay loam or channery silty clay loam with subhorizons of silt loam in the upper part and thin subhorizons of channery silty clay and silty clay in the lower part of some pedons. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has value of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam or silty clay or the channery or very channery analogs of those textures. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 40 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silty clay or the channery or very channery analogs of those textures. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 40 percent."

Citico, McTaggart (T), and Skinner soils do not have a paralithic contact within the series control section. Muskingum and Sund (T) soils average between 18 and 27 percent clay in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brecksville soils are on valley sides of dissected Wisconsin age till plains and lake plains. They formed in residuum from thin-bedded shale with minor amounts of siltstone. Slope ranges from 25 to 70 percent. Elevation is 700 to 1000 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 44 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 195 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Allis, Chagrin, Chili, Ellsworth, Hornell, Mahoning, Pierpont, and Platea soils. All of these soils formed in till except Chagrin and Chili. Allis and Hornell soils are on broad flats and side slopes along less dissected drainageways. Chagrin soils are on flood plains. Chili soils are on terraces. Ellsworth and Mahoning soils are on less sloping areas and contain more clay and have an argillic horizon. Pierpont and Platea soils also are on less sloping areas but are more silty and have a fragipan."

The Brecksville soils were included in the Gosport soils in Lake County, Ohio.\nMore investigation is needed to determine if Brecksville soils have a lithic contact, in addition, to the paralithic contact.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory characterization data and engineering test data are available for pedon CY-3, the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
