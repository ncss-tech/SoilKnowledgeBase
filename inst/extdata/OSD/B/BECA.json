Texture is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy silt loam or ashy loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt1 horizon value is 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist. The chroma is 3 or 4 dry or moist. The texture is silt loam or loam. There is 5 to 15 percent basalt rock fragments in this horizon. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon value is 4 of 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist. The chroma is 3 or 4 dry or moist. The texture is gravelly silt loam, cobbly silt loam, gravelly loam, or cobbly loam. There is 15 to 35 percent basalt rock fragments in this horizon.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beca soils are on flat or dissected hill slopes on uplands. Elevation is 2,400 to 3,200 feet. Slopes are 3 to 40 percent. Beca soils formed in post-Wisconsin loess mixed with volcanic ash and pumice primarily from the G and B eruptions of Glacier Peak 12,750 to 11,250 years ago over Wisconsin and pre-Wisconsin age loess mixed with colluvium over basalt bedrock. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January air temperature is 26 degrees F., average July air temperature is 70 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."

Norax soils are on uplands, are fine-silty and do not have a mollic epipedon. Slickear soils are on uplands and are fine-silty."
