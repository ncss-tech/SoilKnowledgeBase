These soils are usually dry from about May 1 through December 1 and are usually moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.

The mean annual soil temperature is 11 to 15 degrees C.  The surface rock fragment ranges from 20 to 60 percent with 3 to 15 percent boulders and stones, 1 to 20 percent cobbles, and 5 to 50 percent gravel.  Some boulders exceed six feet in diameter.  The soil is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 6/3 and moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 4/3.  Textures are cobbly loamy sand and bouldery loamy coarse sand.  The rock fragment content is 15 to 35 percent with 3 to 15 percent boulders, stones, cobbles, and 15 to 30 percent gravel.  The organic carbon content is 0.4 to 0.6 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 7/3, 7/4, 6/4, 6/3, 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/4.  Textures are very cobbly, very stony, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  The rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 65 percent with 5 to 30 percent boulders and stones, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel. Clay films are thin to moderately thick and are few to many.  The clay content ranges from 10 to 25 percent, but averages 10 to 18 percent.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 7/3 or 7/4 and moist color is 10YR 5/3 or 5/4.  Textures are very stony or extremely stony loamy coarse sand, with rock fragment content similar to the B horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 50 cm (The A1 and  A2 horizons).\n1.1 Organic carbon values of 0.4 to 0.6 percent were determined in laboratory using the wet combustion method.  The average sand: clay ratio for the upper 40 cm of soil is 8-13:1.  This places the soil in Xerollic subgroup.\n2.  Argillic horizon - The zone from 50 to 112 cm (The Bt1 and  Bt2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 50 to 100 cm (The Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizons).\n3.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric; estimated using Thornthwaite water balance method on local meteorological data, soil moisture data, and vegetation indicators.  MAP is 200 to 250 mm - determined by extrapolating between weather stations, considering topographic influences, and using vegetation as indicators.\n4.  The soil temperature regime is mesic (11 to 15 degrees C.)  This is extrapolated from actual soil temperature data over a three year period using 12 month averages.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
