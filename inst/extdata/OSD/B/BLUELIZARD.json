  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluelizard series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum from granitic sources.  The Bluelizard soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 598 millimeters (24 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.).",
