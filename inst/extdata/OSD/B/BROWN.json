  "OVERVIEW": "The Brown series consists of shallow, well drained soils on hills.  These soils formed in alluvium and residuum from sandstone and granite.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days.  Elevation is 5,000 to 5,800 feet.",
