  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact to firm to soft sandstone is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 61 degrees F. and the soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. at all times. The soil between the depths of 12 and 35 inches or to a paralithic contact, whichever is shallow, is continuously moist in some or all parts from about mid-November until about mid-May. The soil usually is dry all the rest of the time. The soil profile is sand or loamy sand throughout and usually has a little more clay in the lower part.\nThe A11 horizon is slightly or medium acid and the remainder of the profile is slightly to strongly acid. The A11 horizon is grayish brown or brown and the remainder of the profile is slightly to strongly acid.  The A11 horizon is grayish brown or brown and the remainder of the profile is light brownish gray, and gray, pale brown, brown or dark brown.\nThe C1 horizon lacks mottles in some pedons. The dominant chroma of both th matrix and mottles is more than 2, usually 3 or 4."

Mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.
