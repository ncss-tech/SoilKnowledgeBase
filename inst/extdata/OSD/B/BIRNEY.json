  "OVERVIEW": "The Birney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from semiconsolidated interbedded sandstone and hard shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, stream terraces, escarpments and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees.",
