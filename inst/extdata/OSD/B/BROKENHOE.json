  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brokenhoe series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Brokenhoe soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brokenhoe soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,015 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
