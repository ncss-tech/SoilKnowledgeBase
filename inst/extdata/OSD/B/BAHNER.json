  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the 2Btx horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Chert gravel by volume is 0 to 10 percent in the A and Bt horizons, 5 to 50 percent in the 2Btx horizon and 5 to 20 percent in the 3Bt horizon.  Chert cobble by volume is less than 5 percent in the A and Bt horizons, but ranges to 40 percent in the 2Btx horizon and is less than 10 percent in the 3Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  An E  horizon is present in pedons that have not been cultivated.  Some pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon commonly has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8 (no 2 chroma colors occur within 30 inches of the soil surface).  It is silty clay loam or clay loam or their gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues.  Coarse  fragments are often horizontally oriented and there is variable moderately expressed brittleness in 30 to 60 percent of the fine material.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, chroma of 4 to 8 and commonly is mottled.  It is clay or silty clay or their gravelly or cobbly analogues.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bahner soils are on low ridgetops, sideslopes and noseslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and cherty dolomite residuum.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Eldon, Goss and Paintbrush series.  Eldon and Goss soils average more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and are on lower sideslopes.  Paintbrush soils have more sand and less clay in the control section, and have gray mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface. They are on similar landscape positions, tending toward higher elevations in the landscape."
