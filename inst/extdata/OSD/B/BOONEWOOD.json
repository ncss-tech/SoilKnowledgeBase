  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments, commonly gravel and channers, range from 0 to 8 percent in the A and B horizons, and 0 to 15 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Depth to redoximorphic features, with a chroma of 2 or less, range from 17 to 24 inches.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bw horizons with colors and textures similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, or gray are within 24 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, and rarely loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of red, brown or gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, and rarely loam."

The well drained Kinnick and Nolin soils, the moderately well drained Lindside soils, the somewhat poorly drained Newark soils, and the poorly drained Melvin soils are on adjacent flood plains.  The well drained Elk and Ashton soils, and the moderately well drained Otwood soils are on adjacent stream terraces. The well drained Woolper soils and the moderately well drained Sees soils are on adjacent foot slopes.  In addition, the Woolper and Sees soils have darker surfaces and more clay in the control section.  The Newark and Melvin soils have dominant low chroma within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.  The Elk and Ashton soils have argillic horizons, and the Ashton soils have a dark surface.  The Otwood soils have argillic horizons and a fragipan.  All the associated soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock."
