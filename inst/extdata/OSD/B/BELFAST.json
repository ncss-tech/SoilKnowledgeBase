    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry for a period of 45 to 60 consecutive days in the summer. The series control section has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  These soils are free of mottles above have a water table as high as 3.5 to 5 feet at times in fall and winter.  Reaction is slightly to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is massive or has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure. Some pedons have dark brown stains in root channels.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist. Some pedons have dark brown mottles below a depth of 30 inches. This horizon is stratified silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand and loamy sand. Thin gravel strata are present in some pedons."

The climate is cool and dry in summer and mild and wet in winter. Annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches. Average January temperature is about 40 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 170 days."

Juno soils are sandy-skeletal. Lummi and Puget soils are fine-silty and poorly drained.  Nooksack soils have a mollic epipedon and are coarse-silty.  Norma soils are poorly drained and have prominent mottles within 20 inches of the surface.  Oridia soils are coarse-silty and poorly drained."
