  "OVERVIEW": "The Brannan series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from schist and that have a mantle of volcanic ash.  Brannan soils are on mountains with slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The thickness of the volcanic ash mantle is 14 to 20 inches and contains 60 to 70 percent volcanic glass and glass aggragate.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 35 percent channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones.\nThe 2B horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
