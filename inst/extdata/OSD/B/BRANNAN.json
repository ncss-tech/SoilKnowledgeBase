The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The thickness of the volcanic ash mantle is 14 to 20 inches and contains 60 to 70 percent volcanic glass and glass aggragate.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 35 percent channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones.\nThe 2B horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam, and has 30 to 50 percent channers and 5 to 15 percent flagstones.  Percent clay is 15 to 30 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very channery sandy loam or very channery sandy clay loam, and has 30 to 50 percent channers and 5 to 15 percent flagstones."

Capoose, Olot, Rouen, and Vingulch soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Crackler soils are loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Elbowlake, Natapoc, and Nevine soils have 2Cd horizons. Farway, Kellerbutte, and Saska soils are very deep."

They formed in colluvium derived from schist and have a mantle of volcanic ash.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches.  The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

The Chambeam and Sinker soils have a mollic epipedon and are on hills at lower elevations.  The Piersonte soils are formed in similar geologic material but lack the volcanic ash mantle, and have a mollic epipedon.  Sisley soils are on adjacent south-facing slopes and lack the volcanic ash mantle."
