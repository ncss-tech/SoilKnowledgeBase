  "OVERVIEW": "The Binco series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Binco soils are on alluvial fans and mountain foot slopes. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section is normally clay or silty clay, but percent of clay ranges from 35 to 60.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the major part of the control section.  They are mainly shale fragments of 1/2- to 3-inch size.  Cracks up to 1 inch or more wide occur when soils are dry for 100 to 150 days. Cracks extend to depths of 20 or more inches.  Slickensides that intersect are common to depths of 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous material ranges 0 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, and 4 or 5 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, and 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6."
