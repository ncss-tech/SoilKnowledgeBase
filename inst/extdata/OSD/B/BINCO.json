  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section is normally clay or silty clay, but percent of clay ranges from 35 to 60.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the major part of the control section.  They are mainly shale fragments of 1/2- to 3-inch size.  Cracks up to 1 inch or more wide occur when soils are dry for 100 to 150 days. Cracks extend to depths of 20 or more inches.  Slickensides that intersect are common to depths of 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous material ranges 0 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, and 4 or 5 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, and 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum, and is derived from sedimentary rocks.  Elevation is 7,200 to 8,200 feet.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 14 inches.  In other colder areas it ranges to 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 35 to 65 days."
