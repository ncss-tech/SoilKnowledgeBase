  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 69 degrees to 72 degrees F.  The solum ranges in thickness from 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 32 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 26 inches but the depth to uniform accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  In the particle-size control section and C horizon coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, EC exceeds 4 millimhos and exchangeable sodium percentage is greater than 15 percent.  This soil is dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section for 90 cumulative days when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F., or higher in nine years out of ten.  It is moist in some or all parts for 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F., or higher in three years out of ten.  The duration that the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. ranges from 205 to 240 days.  Finely divided gypsum buffers soil reaction in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral through strongly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 20 to 60 percent, and sand from 15 to 50 percent.  It commonly is strongly alkaline but ranges from slightly alkaline through very strongly alkaline in the upper part.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 20 to 60 percent silt, and 15 to 50 percent sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  It is coarser than the argillic horizon and ranges in clay from 15 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 55, percent and sand from 15 to 60 percent.  It is slightly alkaline through very strongly alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beckton soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium, residuum, or valley fill weathered from sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches.  Frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.  Elevation is 3,500 to 5,500 feet."
