The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than half the time (cumulative) when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F, in most years.  The depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.   The solum has 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent of the particles are coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is slightly to violently effervescent.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon has indurated plates which have weakly cemented soil material between them.  It is massive and indurated in the upper part and weakly to strongly cemented below.\nThe BCq horizon has a fine earth fraction of loam, loamy sand or sand with 0 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is weakly to strongly cemented."

The soils formed in old alluvial sediments with an influence of mixed volcanic ash and loess.  Winters are cool and moist and summers are warm and dry.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches.  The mean January temperature is 24 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 68 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

The Baldock soil is fine-loamy, lacks a duripan and is located on adjacent bottom lands.  The North Powder soils is fine-loamy, moderately deep to bedrock and is located on adjacent hillslopes.  The Powder soil is coarse-silty, lacks a duripan and is located on adjacent bottom lands.  The Ruckles soil is clayey-skeletal, shallow and is located on adjacent hillslopes.  The Virtue soil is fine-silty, has an ochric epipedon and an argillic horizon and is on terraces."
