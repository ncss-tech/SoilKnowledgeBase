  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout. Content of mica flakes ranges from none to common. Content of rounded gravel typically ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout, but may range to 50 percent in thin strata below a depth of 40 inches. Buried soil horizons, present in many pedons, have the same range in color and texture as the Ag horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2.5 to 4. Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Ag horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2.5 to 7. The combined thickness of the A and Ag horizons with value of 3 or less is less than 7 inches. Iron and organic matter concentrations in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common. Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5BG, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 3 to 7. Masses of iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow and brown range from none to many.  Texture of the upper part of the Cg horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam; or is stratified with these textures. Thin strata of finer or coarser textured material are in most pedons. Texture of the lower part of the Cg horizon includes coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand in addition to those of the upper part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bibb soils are on flood plains of streams in the Coastal Plain. Slopes are generally less than 2 percent. They formed in loamy and sandy alluvium. They flood frequently unless protected, and are subject to scouring and uneven deposition of overwash.  The climate is humid subtropical. The average annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 72 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Iuka, Johnston, Kinston, Mantachie, Myatt, Ochlockonee and Osier soils. The moderately well drained Iuka soils are on higher positions near stream channels. Johnston soils                    . The somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils are on slightly higher adjacent positions and have fine-loamy control sections. Myatt soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons. The well drained Ochlockonee soils are on higher natural levee positions along stream channels. Osier soils are sandy throughout."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Bibb soils are used for wildlife habitat and watershed protection.  The dominant over story vegetation consists of sweetgum, scattered loblolly pine, red maple, water oak, willow oak, green ash, baldcypress, swamp tupelo, and black willow. A few areas have been cleared, drained and used for pasture."
