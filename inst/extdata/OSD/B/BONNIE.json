  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bonnie soils are on nearly level flood plains and, in some places, on flood-plain steps. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in light colored, recently deposited, acid, silty alluvium. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1168 mm (38 to 46 inches), frost free period ranges from 170 to 210 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 213 meters (340 to 700 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belknap, Birds, Petrolia, Piopolis, and Racoon soils. The somewhat poorly drained Belknap soils are on adjacent slightly higher parts of the flood plains. The poorly drained Birds and Petrolia soils are on similar positions, but formed in alluvium that is less acid. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Piopolis soils are in similar parts of flood plains nearby and contain more clay throughout. The poorly drained Racoon soils are on adjacent or nearby stream terraces. In Indiana, Bonnie soils are associated with the somewhat poorly drained Stendal and moderately well drained Steff soils. These soils are on higher lying parts of flood plains."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/sec). Permeability is moderately slow (0.2 to 0.6 inches per hour). Flooding from stream overflow ranges from frequent to rare periods, and commonly occurs in the winter and spring. In the undrained condition, these soils have an intermittent apparent water table from as much as 2.0 feet above the surface to 0.5 foot below the surface, typically between October and July in most years. Where drained, an intermittent water table is within 1 foot of the surface, typically between December and May in most years. The potential for surface water runoff is low or medium."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In the update of the Wayne County, Illinois Soil Survey it was determined that the previous type location classified as Fine-silty, mixed, active, acid, mesic Sodic Vermaquepts. Thus, the type location is being moved until the series can be evaluated throughout the full extent of the series. In some areas these soils have been described as having weak or moderate blocky structure through the middle part of the control section. These soils will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if placement in the order of Entisols is correct or a new series in the order of Inceptisols is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons); irregular decrease in organic carbon; aquic conditions - chroma 1 or 2 matrix and redox accumulations in all layers below the Ap horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is on file at the East Central Glaciated Regional Office (MLRA NO. 11) at Indianapolis, and at the Illinois State Office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
