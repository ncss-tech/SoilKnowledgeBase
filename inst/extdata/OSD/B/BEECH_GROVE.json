    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 1 to 8 inches. The content of rock fragments, dominantly limestone, ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout. Some pedons effervesce.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe bedrock is dominantly gray calcareous limestone, but some pedons contain chert or thin layers of shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beech Grove soils formed in residuum from limestone bedrock but may contain chert or thin layers of shale, and are on upland in the Appalachian Ridges and Valleys. The soil is on bedrock controlled landforms that contain areas of exposed bedrock rising 1 to 5 feet above the ground and extremely steep escarpments adjacent to streams. Slope gradients range from 3 to 100 percent but are commonly 3 to 25 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 54 inches, and frost free days range from 130 to 180 days."

Caneyville and Opequon soil are on similar topographic positions and have lithic contacts at depths greater than 10 inches. Frederick and Poyner soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Timberville soils are lower on the landscape and are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock."
