  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than one-half of the time when the soil temperature is 41 degrees F. or more (xeric).  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  An abrupt clay increase exists between the A and 2Bt horizons of 20 to 30 percent within a vertical distance of one inch.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section has a weighted average of 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist and dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is a clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent stones, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 5 to 15 percent gravel.  Soil structure is angular blocky or prismatic.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bingville soils are on plateaus and benches.  They are formed in clayey residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 3,800 to 5,800 feet.  The climate can be characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 90 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Diffin, Gwin, Kettenbach, and Prill soils.  Diffin soils are deep or very deep to bedrock, have secondary carbonates, and are found on steep, north facing slopes.  Gwin and Kettenbach soils have mesic temperature regime and are on steep, south facing slopes.  In addition, Gwin soils are shallow to bedrock and Kettenbach are moderately deep.  Prill soils have mesic temperature regimes, are non-skeletal, and are on benches."
