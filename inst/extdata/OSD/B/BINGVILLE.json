  "OVERVIEW": "The Bingville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  They are on plateaus and benches.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than one-half of the time when the soil temperature is 41 degrees F. or more (xeric).  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  An abrupt clay increase exists between the A and 2Bt horizons of 20 to 30 percent within a vertical distance of one inch.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section has a weighted average of 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist and dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is a clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent stones, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 5 to 15 percent gravel.  Soil structure is angular blocky or prismatic.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Diffin soils are deep or very deep to bedrock, have secondary carbonates, and are found on steep, north facing slopes.  Gwin and Kettenbach soils have mesic temperature regime and are on steep, south facing slopes.  In addition, Gwin soils are shallow to bedrock and Kettenbach are moderately deep.  Prill soils have mesic temperature regimes, are non-skeletal, and are on benches."
