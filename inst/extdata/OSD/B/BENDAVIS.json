    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or its gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral. Rock fragments range from 10 to 70 percent.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is the cobbly to extremely cobbly or gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 6.  It is extremely cobbly silt loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid."

These soils formed in gravelly hillslope sediments, gravelly colluvium, or gravelly residuum from chert bedrock. Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Coulstone and Poynor soils are very deep and are on dissected side slopes adjacent to the Bendavis soils.  Tonti and Viburnum soils are very deep and are on higher broader ridgetops.  In addition, Tonti soils have a fragipan."
