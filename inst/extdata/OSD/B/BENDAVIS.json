  "OVERVIEW": "The Bendavis series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands.  They formed in gravelly hillslope sediments, gravelly colluvium, or gravelly residuum weathered from chert bedrock.  These soils are on gently sloping to very steep upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or its gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral. Rock fragments range from 10 to 70 percent.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is the cobbly to extremely cobbly or gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 6.  It is extremely cobbly silt loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid."
