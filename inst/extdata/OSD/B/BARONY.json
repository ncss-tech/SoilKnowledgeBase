  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Barony soils are on outwash plains or stream terraces and, in some places, are on alluvial fans above the level of flooding. The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying stratified loamy outwash or alluvial sediments of Wisconsinan Age. Slope gradients range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 11.7 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1,140 mm (30 to 45 inches). Frost free days range from 140 to 180. Elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Brenton and Millbrook soils are on slightly lower lying landform positions. The moderately well drained Danabrook soils were developed in loess and the underlying till on nearby landforms. The moderately well drained Somonauk and Clare soils form a biosequence with Barony soils and are on similar landform positions. The poorly drained Drummer soils are in depressions or lower lying areas."

An intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 2.0 to 3.5 feet (61 to 107 cm) below the surface at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and moderately high to high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A large extent of previously mapped Harvard in DeKalb County will now be mapped as Barony due to MLRA update activities. These soils were found to be moderately well drained instead of well drained in MLRAs 108 and areas of 95B. They fit an oxyaquic subgroup rather than a typic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - 20 to 137 cm (8 to 54 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, 2Bt6, 2Bt7, and 2Bt8 horizons); udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
