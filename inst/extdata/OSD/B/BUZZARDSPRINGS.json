  "OVERVIEW": "The Buzzardsprings series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous rock. The Buzzardsprings soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
