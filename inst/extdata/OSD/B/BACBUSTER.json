  "OVERVIEW": "The Bacbuster series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in interbedded sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and shale residuum.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
