  "OVERVIEW": "The Bario series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in materials derived from conglomerate and tuff.  Bario soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
