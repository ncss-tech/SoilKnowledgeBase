  "OVERVIEW": "The Buffmeyer series consists of soils formed in moderately coarse textured very gravelly alluvial fan sediments derived principally from crystalline rocks.  Buffmeyer soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping alluvial fans, terraces, stream bottoms, and valley side slopes in mountain areas.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.  Typically, Buffmeyer soils have grayish brown granular A1 horizons, very pale brown noncalcareous light sandy loam A2 horizons, brown and yellowish brown gravelly sandy loam B2t horizons having subangular blocky structure, and light yellowish brown noncalcareous gravely light sandy loam C horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is about 54 degrees F.  The soils are noncalcareous to depth of more than 40 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 55 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent in a major part of the solum and C horizon and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period of nearly every year.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  The A2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 7.  It is typically sandy loam but averages 8 to 18 clay, 5 to 35 percent silty, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon normally has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline."
