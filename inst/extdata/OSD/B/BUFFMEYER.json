  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is about 54 degrees F.  The soils are noncalcareous to depth of more than 40 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 55 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent in a major part of the solum and C horizon and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period of nearly every year.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  The A2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 7.  It is typically sandy loam but averages 8 to 18 clay, 5 to 35 percent silty, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon normally has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline."

Judkins and Namon soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Wapshilla soils lack continuous A2 horizons and are in areas having dominantly winter precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Buffmeyer soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping alluvial fans, terraces, stream bottoms, and valley side slopes in mountainous areas.  Slopes typically range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured very gravelly alluvial fan sediments derived principally from crystalline rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 34 degrees F. and the average summmer temperature is 54 degrees F."
