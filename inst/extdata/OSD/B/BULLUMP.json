  "OVERVIEW": "The Bullump series consist of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from quartzite, welded tuff, chert, argillite, shale, conglomerate, and rhyolite with a component of loess.  Bullump soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Camelback and Softback soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are dominated by cobbles.  Chrisflat and Murain soils do not have lithic contacts between 100 and 200 cm from the soil surface.  Snyderville soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of less than 100 cm and have sandy C horizons.  Dooh soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Dogbed soils have mollic epipedons that include most subhorizons of the argillic horizon and have rock fragments which are volcanic rocks such as tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Erig soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Krenka soils have 20 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Softscrabble soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of more than 150 cm.  Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime and average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in colluvium derived from quartzite, argillite, chert, conglomerate, shale, and rhyolite with a component of loess.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,495 to 2,625 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 360 to 460 mm, but ranges to 560 mm at the highest elevations.  The mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
