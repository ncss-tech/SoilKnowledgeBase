    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Solution cavities up to 60 inches or more deep are present in many pedons.  Silt plus clay in the control section is less than 5 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a salt-and-pepper appearance with many clean uncoated sand grains.  When rubbed, it has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a thin, discontinuous Bt horizon in solution holes.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red range from none to many.  Texture is sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red range from none to common.  Up to 2 percent, by volume, cobbles or boulders are in many pedons.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a Cr horizon that overlies the bedrock.  It is composed of soft white crumbly limestone that can be dug with a spade.\nThe R horizon consists of limestone bedrock that can be dug with light power equipment."

Adamsville and Satellite soils are on similar positions.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Canaveral soils are on slightly higher positions and are composed of mixed sand and shell fragments.  Padre and Panam soils are confined to barrier islands on the Texas Gulf Coast."

They formed in sandy marine deposits overlying limestone bedrock.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F."

All of these soils except Boca and Hallandale soils are very deep.  The very poorly or poorly drained Boca soils are on lower positions have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness, have an argillic horizon above the limestone, and are moderately deep.  The very poorly and poorly drained Felda and Riviera soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick over argillic horizons.  Hallandale soils have limestone within depths of 20 inches and are poorly drained.  The poorly drained Pompano soils are in adjacent lower depressions, drainageways, and broad flats."

The native vegetation is dominated by cabbage palms and scattered slash pines in the overstory.  The understory is composed of pineland threeawn, fetterbush, grassleaf goldaster, chalky bluestem, creeping bluestem, panicum, lopsided indiangrass, switchgrass, and sawpalmetto."
