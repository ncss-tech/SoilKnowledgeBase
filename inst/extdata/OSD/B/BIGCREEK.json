  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bigcreek soils are on low terraces adjoining rivers and streams at elevations of 1,800 to 2,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in volcanic ash, pumice and a small amount of loess over glacial outwash sand, gravel and cobbles.  Bigcreek soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. with an average January temperature of about 23 degrees F. and an average July temperature of about 66 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, the frost-free season is 75 to 110 days and the growing season at 28 degrees F. is 125 to 160 days."

Chiwawa soils are on terraces and are dominated by volcanic ash throughout the 10 to 40 inch control section and have sandy-skeletal outwash below 40 inches.  Choralmont soils are on mountainsides and are dominated by volcanic ash and pumice in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Mippon soils are on terraces and have A horizons 10 inches thick.  Nevine soils are on moraines and mountains and lack pumice in the control section and are over loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are an intermittent albic horizon at the mineral surface and a cambic horizon from below the intermittent albic horizon to 17 inches.  The particle-size control section from 0.5 to 40.5 inches is ashy (1/2 to 17 inches), pumiceous (17 to 31 inches), the ashy horizon from 31 to 34 inches is too thin for contrasting, thus it is included with the 17 to 31 inch layer, the loamy part from 34 to 39 inches and sandy-skeletal from 39 to 40.5 inches.  The PSCS is considered ashy over pumiceous or cindery and pumiceous or ashy-pumiceous over loamy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
