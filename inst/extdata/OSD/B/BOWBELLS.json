  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowbells series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till and alluvium from glacial till on glacial till plains and moraines.  These soils have moderate permeability in the upper part and moderately slow or slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil commonly has 1 to 10 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon typically is more than 20 inches thick. A flooded phase is recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma greater than 1.5.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Faint or distinct redox features are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  It typically is clay loam, but some is loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The Bt horizon has strong or moderate prismatic structure parting to moderate or strong medium and fine blocky.  Faces of peds have faint or distinct clay films and organic stains.  Some pedons have a Bw horizon below the Bt horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has masses of carbonates and 10 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It occurs at depths of 18 to over 36 inches.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is mottled in some pedons.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam glacial till which is massive or has weak blocky and laminar structure.  It has coarser textures below 40 inches in some pedons.  Segregated carbonates, gypsum crystals, and iron and lignite spots are in the C horizon in many pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Slope gradients commonly are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous glacial till and local alluvium from till.  The climate is cool, semiarid with long cold winters and short warm summers.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from l2 to 19 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."

Arnegard and Grail soils are in swales and concave positions adjacent to Bowbells soils.  Arnegard soils do not have argillic horizons and Grail soils have fine textured Bt horizons.  Hamerly soils are near edges of basins and have calcic horizons within 16 inches of the surface.  Max and Zahl soils commonly are on steeper slopes and do not have argillic horizons.  Niobell and Noonan soils are on nearby till plains and have natric horizons.  Parnell and Tonka soils are in basins and have fine textured Bt horizons.  Williams soils are on convex positions of the till plain and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick."
