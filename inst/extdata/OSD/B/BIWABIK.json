  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates is greater than 80 inches. The series control section contains more than 25 percent very coarse, coarse and medium sand. Rock fragment content averages 15 to 35 percent by volume in the series control section, with 15 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. The depth to the bottom of the Bw horizon is less than 10 inches. Depth to lamellae is 28 to 50 inches.  The base saturation is less than 60 percent in all layers above a depth of 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 25 percent by volume. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon immediately below the A horizon. It has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 25 percent by volume. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a Bw2 horizon. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content averages 10 to 35 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content averages 10 to 35 percent by volume, but thin subhorizons or strata may contain less than 10 percent or more than 35 percent. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizon has properties similar to the E horizon above it. The Bt part of the horizon consists of lamellae that are 1/8 to 1 inch in thickness. The combined thickness within a depth of 60 inches is less than 6 inches. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam. Reaction of the E and Bt horizon is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content averages 10 to 35 percent by volume, with some pedons containing thin subhorizons with as much as 50 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."
