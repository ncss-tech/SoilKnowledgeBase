  "OVERVIEW": "The Bickerdyke series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
