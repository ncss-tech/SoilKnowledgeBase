Lab samples were SS1580- SS1584. Diagnostic horizon recognized in this pedon is: mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and A horizons); Udic moisture regime.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (A, C horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 12 inches.  (Ap, A horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2C horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory: 97KS601126, SS1253-1258; 94KS087550, SS1580-1584; 95KS087551, SS1585-1590.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
