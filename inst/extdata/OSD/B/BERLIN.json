  "OVERVIEW": "The Berlin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty and clayey glaciolacustrine deposits.  They are nearly level to moderately steep soils on slightly elevated positions on lacustrine terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the surface layer and upper subsoil, low to moderately high in the lower substratum, and moderately low or low in the substratum.   Mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 45 inches.  Weighted average clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent in the control section and from 18 to 45 percent below 40 inches.  Rock fragments, mostly fine gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 5 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral in the A horizon, strongly acid through neutral in the B horizon, and from moderately acid through neutral in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It has iron depeltions above a depth of 24 inches.  The Bw horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam, except in some pedons the lower part of the horizon is silty clay.  Weighted average clay content is 18 to 35 percent.  Structure of the upper part of the Bw horizon is subangular blocky, granular, or platy.  The lower part of the horizon is platy, subangular blocky, blocky, or has prismatic structure parting to plates or blocks.  The Bw horizon is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of individual varves ranges from very fine sand through silt to clay, but the weighted average texture of the horizon ranges from silt loam to silty clay.  The C horizon is massive, platy, or has weak prismatic structure parting to plates.  Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Berlin soils are nearly level to moderately steep and are on lacustrine terraces.  Slope commonly is 0 to 8 percent but the range includes 0 to 25 percent.  Typically, the soils are on slightly elevated knolls on the landscape.  Steeper areas are mainly on terrace risers or on short sideslopes along drainageways.  The soils formed in silty and clayey glaciolacustrine deposits.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 135 to 195 days."

The Branford, Ellington, and Hartford soils are glaciofluvial associates formed in loamy over stratified sandy and gravelly deposits. Cheshire, Ludlow, Watchaug, Wethersfield, and Wilbraham soils are nearby upland soils formed in reddish glacial till.  Elmridge and Shaker soils are moderately well drained and poorly drained associates on lacustrine terraces that formed in loamy over clayey deposits. Scitico soils are on lower positions and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section."
