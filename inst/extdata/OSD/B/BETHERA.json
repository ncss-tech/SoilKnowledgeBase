Similar series in other families are Bayboro, Bladen, Byars, Cantey, Coxville, Grady, Leaf, Lumbee, Pantego, Paxville, Rains, Rembert, and Roanoke series.  Bayboro, Byars, Pantego, and Paxville soils have an umbric epipedon.  Bladen, Cantey, and Leaf soils have an abrupt texture change between the A and B horizons.  Byars, Cantey, Coxville, and Rembert soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Lumbee, Pantego, Paxville, and Rains soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Roanoke soils have a solum thickness of 40 to 60 inches."
