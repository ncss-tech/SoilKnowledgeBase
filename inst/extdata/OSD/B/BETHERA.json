Common to many masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in most pedons.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: (Due to complexity of changes in the Keys to Taxonomy, this section was not updated at this time). There are no other known series in this family. Similar series in other families are Bayboro, Bladen, Byars, Cantey, Coxville, Grady, Leaf, Lumbee, Pantego, Paxville, Rains, Rembert, and Roanoke series.  Bayboro, Byars, Pantego, and Paxville soils have an umbric epipedon.  Bladen, Cantey, and Leaf soils have an abrupt texture change between the A and B horizons.  Byars, Cantey, Coxville, and Rembert soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Lumbee, Pantego, Paxville, and Rains soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Roanoke soils have a solum thickness of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bethera soils are on nearly level and slightly depressional areas on terraces and flood plains of the lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in clayey marine or fluvial sediments.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 52 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 240 to 280 days."

Craven and Goldsboro soils are on higher landscapes, and have dominant chroma of 3 or more in the Bt horizon. Lynchburg and Wahee soils are on slightly higher landscapes and have a subhorizon dominated by chroma of 3 or more.
