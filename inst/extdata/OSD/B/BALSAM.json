  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bloodyhorse, Heintooga, and Mt Rogers series.  Bloodyhorse soils have a lithic contact between 20 to 40 inches. Heintooga soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered from low-grade metamorphic rocks. Mt Rogers soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Balsam soils are on gently sloping to very steep parts of foot slopes, toe slopes, benches, and fans in coves at high elevations in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Slope is commonly between 15 and 50 percent, but ranges from 2 to 95 percent. Elevation is generally above 4,800 feet, but may extend down to 4,300 feet on north or east aspects.  Balsam soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered from felsic, intermediate, and mafic high-grade metamorphic or igneous rocks such as mica gneiss, granite, high-grade metagraywacke, and hornblende gneiss. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 110 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days, and length of the growing season is about three months. Moist atmospheric conditions in the form of fog and cloud cover are prevalent throughout the year in these high mountain areas."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Burton, Clingman, Craggey, Longhope, Tanasee, and Wayah soils. Burton, Tanasee, and Wayah soils are in a  fine-loamy particle-size class. Clingman and Craggey soils have a lithic contact less than 20 inches deep. Longhope soils are very poorly drained and have organic horizons 16 to 30 inches thick overlying mineral soil material. Burton, Clingman, Craggey, and Wayah soils occur on adjacent ridges and side slopes. Longhope soils occur in broad drainageways or fens (locally referred to as \"bogs\"). Tanasee soils occur on landscapes similar to Balsam soils but more commonly occur on convex areas between drainageways and on toeslopes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is very low on gentle slopes, low on strongly sloping and moderately steep slopes, and medium on steeper slopes. Runoff is much lower where forest litter has little or no disturbance. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the subsoil and moderately rapid in the underlying material. Balsam soils receive moisture from surrounding uplands; therefore, springs and seepage areas are common."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is in State or Federal ownership and is used for watershed protection, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Most of this soil is forested. In areas higher than about 5,400 feet, red spruce and fraser fir are the dominant trees. At the lower elevations, northern red oak, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, yellow buckeye, and white ash are common trees. In many areas, the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept\" phase is recognized. Common understory plants are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, silverbell, pin cherry, rhododendron, flame azalea, blueberry, blackberry, hay-scented fern, trillium, woodfern, New York fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, and raspberry. A small acreage is used for native pasture."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Balsam series was formerly included with the Spivey series. However, Spivey is in the mesic soil temperature class, forms in colluvium derived from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite and slate, and contains fragments of those rocks.\nAlthough Balsam soils exhibit at least some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass commonly found in soils of related taxa in the Western United States.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) were to add stony texture modifiers to the A1 and A2 horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 15 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - 15 to 50 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nLoamy-skeletal particle-size class - average content of more than 35 percent by volume rock fragments in the particle-size control section (A2, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons: S88NC-121-002, S88NC-121-002A, S88NC-199-015, and S88NC-199-016.\nMLRA: 130B SIR's: NC0234, NC0235 (Bouldery)\nNASIS Data Map Unit ID: NASIS data for the typical pedon in Jackson County, NC are represented by DMU #369461\nRevised: 9/95-MLS,AG; 12/97-DHK; 6/99-MKC; 1/00, 3/03--MKC\n02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
