    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bieber soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks such as andesite, basalt, and tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,070 to 1,865 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 410 mm, including 90 to 120 mm of snow. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 120 days."

Delma soils are shallow to paralithic contacts.  Lassen soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Modoc soils are moderately deep to duripans.  Montague soils are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons.  Packwood soils are loamy, shallow to duripans, have ochric epipedons.
