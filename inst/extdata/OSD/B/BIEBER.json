  "OVERVIEW": "The Bieber series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Bieber soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
