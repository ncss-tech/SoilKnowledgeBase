  "OVERVIEW": "The Blythe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale interbedded with siltstone and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
