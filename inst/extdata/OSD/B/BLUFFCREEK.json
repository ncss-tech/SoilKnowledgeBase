  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates range from 30 to 60 inches.  The depth to the upper boundary of the Bt horizon or the presences of loamy lamellae are within the upper 20 inches of the surface if the upper mantle is entirely sandy.  Volume of rock fragments throughout the A and E horizons range from 0 to 15 percent.  The B and C horizons average from 0 to 35 percent.  Most rock fragments are pebbles .1 to 1.5 inches in diameter.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The value is less than 5.5 when dry.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have thin BE, B/E, or EB transitional horizons with some characteristics of both horizons. However, the E part of the B/E occupies less than 15 percent of the horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.  Included are subhorizons that are sandy clay loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loam, or their gravelly analogues.  The Bt horizon averages between 8 to 18 percent clay.  In some subhorizons there are more than 35 percent rock fragments, but they average less than 35 percent.  The Bt horizon is composed of either continuous horizons more than 3 inches thick or discontinuous, 1 cm or more thick, horizons with a composite thickness greater than 6 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, gravelly sand, or gravelly coarse sand.  Some layers in the C horizon can have more than 35 percent rock fragments but average is less than 35 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bluffcreek soils are on concave to slightly convex slopes on outwash plains, valley trains, and moraines.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  They are formed in loamy or sandy mantle over sandy or gravelly deposits that are often stratified.    The elevation ranges from 1000 to 1500 feet.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Annual frost free days range from 110 to 145 days."
