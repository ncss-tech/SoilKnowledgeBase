  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 19 to 36 inches.  Reaction of the solum ranges from medium acid to neutral.  The C horizons are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contain free carbonates.\nUndisturbed pedons have A horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 and range from 1 to 3 inches thick.  The Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some E horizons contain mottles.  The A and E horizons are loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It contains faint to distinct mottles and is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages between 18 and 27 percent clay.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is dominantly silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is mainly stratified very fine sandy loam, silt, silt loam and thin strata ranging from very fine sand to silty clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Mackinac series.  Similar soils are the Belding, Bowers, Charlevoix, Coral, Gaastra, Richter, and Wainola series.  Mackinac soils are not stratified in the sola and formed in loam glacial till.  Belding, Charlevoix, Coral, Gaastra and Richter soils are coarse-loamy.  Bowers soils do not have spodic horizons and have control sections averaging more than 35 percent clay.  In addition, Belding, Charlevoix, Coral, and Gaastra soils are less stratified in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon; Gaastra soils are leached more deeply and contain more silt and less sand in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon.  Wainola soils are sandy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas.  Slope gradients typically are 0 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in loamy and sandy glaciofluvial deposits of Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 41 to 45 degrees F."

Onaway, Emmet, Kalkaska, Blue Lake, and Rubicon are well drained to excessively drained soils on nearby till and adjacent outwash areas.  The Onaway and Emmet soils are loam or sandy loam with a calcareous substrata.  The Kalkaska, Blue Lake, and Rubicon soils are sandy.  The somewhat poorly drained, loamy Bowers soils and sandy Wainola soils are common associates on lake plains and deltas."
