  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brokit soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains. They formed in alluvium and glacial outwash derived mainly from quartzite, with minor amounts of limestone, dolomite or granite. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 2,070 to 2,800 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gaia, Jumble, and Lemcave soils. Gaia soils are loamy-skeletal, do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth, have thin lamellae in lower horizons, and occur on adjacent moraines.  Jumble soils are loamy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons, cambic horizons, horizons with thin lamellae, and occur on adjacent moraines.  Lemcave soils are sandy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons, and occur on adjacent moraines."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 76 to 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is common. These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between March and September."

The potential native vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of quaking aspen and white fir with an understory of Wood's rose, bluegrass, sedges, and basin wildrye. This site is correlated to Ecological Site F28AY056NV Quaking aspen-Rocky Mountain white fir-Wood's rose, and snowberry."

Selected data are available for the A1 and A2 horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
