  "OVERVIEW": "The Ballona series consists of well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Ballona soils are on alluvial fans, inset fans, and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 445 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C.",
