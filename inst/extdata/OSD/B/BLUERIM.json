    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F.  Depth to bedded sandy shale is 20 to 40 inches.  The soils commonly are noncalcareous.  Calcium carbonate accumulation in the lower part of the C horizon is weak and discontinuous.  Very fine pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is sandy clay loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  EC is less than 4 mmhos.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  Visible accumulation of calcium carbonate is discontinuous."

Alcova, Elk Hollow, Fluetsch, Forelle, Harsha, Rock River, and Stunner soils have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate and have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.  Almy soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt2 horizon, continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate, and bedrock at a depth greater than 40 inches.  Antonito soils have a lithic contact.  Bonfri, Cushool, Diamondville, and Satanka soils have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate.  Regnaps soils are similar but are more moist in July, August, and September.  Rawah soils have hue redder than 5YR in the Bt2 horizon; Regnaps soils have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation and are cryic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bluerim soils are on upland hillsides.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous sandy shales interbedded with arkosic sandstone.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 34 to 45 degrees F.  Precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The growing season is 80 to 120 days but frost may occur in any month."
