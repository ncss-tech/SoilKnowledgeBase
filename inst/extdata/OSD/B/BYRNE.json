  "OVERVIEW": "The Byrne series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 35 to 75 centimeters (14 to 30 inches) of glaciolacustrine deposits over till.  These soils are on nearly level or slightly convex slopes on side slopes on moraines and lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C (42 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters (24 inches).",
