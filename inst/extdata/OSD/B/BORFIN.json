  "OVERVIEW": "The Borfin series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in old alluvial deposits over sandstone. Borfin soils are on shoulders of canyons. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F. Depth to a duripan overlying bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 18 inches and includes part of the argillic horizon. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments. The argillic horizon has a 20 percent increase, absolute, within a vertical distance of 3 inches. An indurated lime-silica cemented duripan occurs above the bedrock and ranges in thickness from 6 to 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is very gravelly clay or very cobbly clay. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 5 dry and moist. Texture is clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkqm horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry. It has many thin discontinuous laminae of silica and carbonates. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent."

It was previously correlated as Wipple Variant."
