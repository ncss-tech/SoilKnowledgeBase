  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonnick series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and pumiceous volcanic ash. Bonnick soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Embal soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 35 inches thick and have irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth. Frentera, Stookmoor, and Wegert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Gardone soils do not have very gravelly or extremely gravelly textures within 150 cm. Picturerock soils have cambic horizons, horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates, and do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section. Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils have buried argillic horizons within 100 cm and buried duripans within 150 cm of the soil surface."
