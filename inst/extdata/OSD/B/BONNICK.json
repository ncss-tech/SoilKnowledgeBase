Borobey soils have firm, brittle horizons over 15 cm thick within 100 cm of the soil surface. Emamount soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Embal soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 35 inches thick and have irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth. Frentera, Stookmoor, and Wegert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Gardone soils do not have very gravelly or extremely gravelly textures within 150 cm. Picturerock soils have cambic horizons, horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates, and do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section. Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils have buried argillic horizons within 100 cm and buried duripans within 150 cm of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,345 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
