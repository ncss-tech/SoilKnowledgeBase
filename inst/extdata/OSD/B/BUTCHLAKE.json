Cuberant, Firada, Targhee soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Butchlake soils have buried A horizons and mottles in the substratum. Enentah soils are somewhat excessively drained. Garlet soils are calcareous in the substratum. Gromes and Storm soils have greater than 10 percent clay in the particle size control section. Soakpak soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 32 degrees F. Telay soils have a presummed cooler mean summer soil temperature."
