  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Bogan soils are noncalcareous throughout, except that in a few pedons very thin and discontinuous calcareous subhorizons occur just above the paralithic contact.  In some pedons C horizons occur below the solum and above the bedrock.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock and range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The solum ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 54 degrees F without an 0 horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically silt loam or silty clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 35 to 65 percent silt, and 5 to 35 percent sand and has less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Willow Creek series.  Willow Creek soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon, have consistent horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation, and lack a paralithic contact above depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bogan soils are on moderate to steeply sloping upland hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  The soil formed in silty materials weathered from underlying siltstone and silty shale.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches, most of which falls during the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F and mean summer temperature is 53 degrees F."
