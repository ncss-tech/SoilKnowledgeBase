  "OVERVIEW": "The Boley series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvial sediments of recent age.  These nearly level to slightly concave soils are on flood plains of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Mean annual precipitation is 102 centimeters (40 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",
