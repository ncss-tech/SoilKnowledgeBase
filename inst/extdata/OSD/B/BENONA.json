  "OVERVIEW": "The Benona series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy deposits on moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
