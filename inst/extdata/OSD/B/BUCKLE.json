Bowbac, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest, Pokeman, Pugsley, and Spangler soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Cambria soils are less than 10 inches deep to the base of the Bt. Chilerojo soils have a densic horizon. Doakum soils have more sand and less silt in the control section. Los Alamos soils have pumice and ash in the control section. Oelop soils have Bt horizons with a base less than 40 inches deep. Palacid soils have calcium carbonate accumulations at 10 to 15 inches. Penistaja, Redpen, and Yenlo soils have more than 40 percent sand. Quagwa soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 54 to 57 degrees F. Sundance and Teckla soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 20 to 40 inches. Yenlo soils have sola 15 to 30 inches thick.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buckle soils are on dipslopes of cuestas, fan terraces and fan remnants on valley sides, drainageways, hills and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. They formed from moderately fine textured alluvium, fan alluvium, and slope alluvium from shale and sandstone. Elevations are 6,400 to 7,200 feet. Climate is semiarid continental. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 150 days."
