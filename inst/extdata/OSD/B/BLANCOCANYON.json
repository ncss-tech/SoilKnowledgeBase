These soils formed in mixed alluvium from John Day Formation tuffaceous sediments with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.,and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
