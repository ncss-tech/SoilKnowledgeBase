  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness more than 80 inches.  Depth to calcareous layers is greater than 20 inches.  When dry, cracks more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks remain open for 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Weighted average clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 60 to 80 percent. Cycles of microknolls and microdepressions are 6 to 24 feet.  In undisturbed areas, microknolls are 3 to 10 inches higher  than the microdepressions.  Slickenside are below depths of 16 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.   Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4,  and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redox concentrations range from none to common in shades of reddish brown and dark brown.  In some pedons few to common grayish redox depletions are within 30 inches of the surface.  Concretions of calcium carbonate range from 0 to 10 percent in the lower Bss horizons.  Some pedons contain masses of secondary carbonates.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.   Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Most pedons contain strata of one or more of these textures.  Concretions of calcium carbonate range from 0 to 10 percent.  Some pedons contain masses of secondary carbonates."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kaufman, Trinity, and Wiergate series.   Similar soils are the Francitas, Ganado, and Pledger series.  Kaufman soils have  chroma of 1 or less in the upper part.  Trinity soils are calcareous throughout.  Wiergate soils have chroma of 1 in the upper 12 inches. Francitas, Ganado and Pledger soils are in the hyperthermic family.  In addition, Francitas and Ganado soils average less than 60 percent clay in the control section."

Mean annual precipition ranges from 42 to 55 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 63 to 65 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 220 to 260 days and elevations range from 250 to 450 days.  Thornthwaite P-E indices exceed 64."

Dardanelle soils have fine-silty control sections.  Desha and Redlake soils are on similar positions.  Kiomatia and Severn soils lack mollic epipedons and are in higher positions in the landscape.  Perry soils are poorly drained, have 1 chroma extending to depths greater than 20 inches and are in lower-lying positions in the landscape.  Roebuck soils are in slightly lower concave positions."
