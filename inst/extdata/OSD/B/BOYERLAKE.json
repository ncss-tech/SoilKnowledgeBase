  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Free carbonates are in all parts of the series control section.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise about 1 to 5 percent of the volume of all horizons.  Typically the percent sand ranges from 10 to 20 percent, the percent silt ranges from 35 to 50 percent, and the percent clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Linear extensibility, from the surface to a depth of 40 inches ranges from 2.4 to 4 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Value dry is 6 or 7.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 20 percent."

The Boyerlake soils formed in glacial till of Late Wisconsin Age.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 20 to 27 inches.  Frost free days range from 90 to 130 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: Ochric epipedon-the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon); Vertic subgroup-based on a linear extensibility of 2.4 inches or greater in the upper 40 inches.  This till was believed to be formed from a minor ice advance through a glacial lake deposit, reworking the sediment into glacial till.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code Numbers 4463 (typical pedon) and 4464 for results of some laboratory data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
