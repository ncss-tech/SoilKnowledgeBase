    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 20 to 30 inches but ranges from 20 to 50 inches and extends into the Bw horizon.  The control section contains 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay loam, but some pedons are silty clay.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Hue of 5Y is only in the lower part.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Few or common faint and distinct redox features in the lower part of some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It typically is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Faint and distinct redox features are few to many.  Some pedons do not have accumulations of carbonate.  Thin strata of coarser textures are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."
