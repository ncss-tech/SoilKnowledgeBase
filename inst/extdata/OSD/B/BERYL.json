  "OVERVIEW": "The Beryl series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  These soils are on valley floors and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

These soils are dry for 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.   They are usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days out of the 120 days following June 21.  The moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nDepth to the horizon containing durinodes, firm consistence with brittleness, or discontinuous silica cementation ranges from 13 to 28 inches.  Pebble content averages less than 15 percent in the particle-size control section.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline and nonsaline to strongly saline.\nThe Bq horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or less commonly, loamy sand.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Discontinuous cementation by silica is weak to strong.   This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and nonsaline to very strongly saline.  Filaments of salt crystals occur in some pedons.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, sand, gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly coarse sand.  Rock fragment content is 5 to 45 percent.
