  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually dry, they are moist in winter and spring.  They are warmer than 41 degrees F from April 1 to November 1, and they are dry within this period after July 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the indurated duripan is 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 11 inches thick.  The particle-size control section contains 25 to 35 percent clay and 10 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 dry 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam but in some areas it is loamy sand.  It contains 5 to 25 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent clay.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  It contains 10 to 30 percent glass and the acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is less than 0.4 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, and clay loam and contains 10 to 35 percent gravel.   It has 25 to 35 percent clay.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe duripan is noncalcareous in the upper part in some pedons. It consists of stratified weakly to strongly cemented gravel and sand sediments below an indurated duripan to depths of 60 inches or more."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arness (T), Espil and Vil series.  Arness soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Vil soils have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the solum and discontinuous opal laminae above the duripan.  Espil soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the Bt horizon and have a duripan at 8 to 14 inches.  All of these soils lack the glass in the surface layer."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in old lacustrine sediment with a capping of ash.  The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F, average January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F, and average July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
