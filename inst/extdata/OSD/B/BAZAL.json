  "OVERVIEW": "The Bazal series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Bazal soils are in drainageways, valleys, and glacial outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters and the average annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
