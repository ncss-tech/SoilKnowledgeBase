  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bazal soils are in drainageways, valleys, and glacial outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are 0 to 91 meters. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. The annual precipitation ranges from 455 to 1,015 millimeters. The average annual temperature ranges from 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."

Deadmanbay soils have a densic contact at 100 to 150 cm and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 20 cm. Killebrew and Mitchellbay soils are in higher elevation positions within valleys and outwash plains and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 20 cm. Shalcar soils are in drainageways and depressions and are Histosols. Sholander soils are in drainageways and valleys, have a sandy particle-size control section, and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 20 centimeters."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the upper part (A, Bw and E horizons) and low to moderately low in the lower part (Btg and Cd horizons). Bazal soils have a perched water table as high as 0 cm from October to April, 26 cm in May, and 60 cm in June, unless the soil is drained. Bazal soils are subject to frequent ponding for very long durations from December to March and for brief durations during October, November, and April."
