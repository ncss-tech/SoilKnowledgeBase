  "REVDATE": "07/2007",
  "STATES": "IL,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackoar series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 34 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 36 to 60 inches or more. Reaction commonly is slightly acid, but includes moderately acid and neutral. The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 27 percent clay. Mineralogy of the clay fraction is dominantly montmorillonite. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10-24 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bg and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y in the matrix, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less with higher chroma mottles. The Cg horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam."

Wabash and Zook soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and are commonly on lower flood plains or depressional areas."
