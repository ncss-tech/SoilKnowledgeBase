  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 36 to 60 inches or more. Reaction commonly is slightly acid, but includes moderately acid and neutral. The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 27 percent clay. Mineralogy of the clay fraction is dominantly montmorillonite. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10-24 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bg and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y in the matrix, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less with higher chroma mottles. The Cg horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam."

Kennebec soils are on slightly higher flood plains adjacent to the streams. Colo soils are on similar positions. Wabash and Zook soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and are commonly on lower flood plains or depressional areas."
