  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Boxiron soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. They are flooded twice daily by saline or brackish tidal waters. Oxidized pH analysis indicates these soils have hypersulfidic materials (pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation), causing them to become extremely acid to ultra acid when drained. Historically, large areas of these soils were ditched for mosquito control, which has led to marsh degradation in some areas.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):\nAquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 203 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)\nHistic epipedon--the zone between 0 and 36 centimeters\nFibric soil materials--the zone between 0 and 18 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths, by volume\nHemic soil materials--the zone between 18 and 36 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing of one-thrid, by volume\nHypersulfidic materials--the zone from 36 to 203 centimeters (oxidized pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation)\nLithologic discontinuity--the zone from 188 to 203 centimeters\nParticle size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters"
