  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic surface and depth to the silty materials ranges from 8 to 16 inches. Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline in undisturbed profiles but ranges from ultra acid to extremely acid upon drying.  Electrical conductivity is greater than 8 Mmhos/cm (5.6 ppt). n values are typically greater than 0.7.\nThe Oi horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and a chroma of 1 or 3.  It is peat.  The fiber content after rubbing is greater than three-fourths of the soil volume.  Mineral material content, by weight, ranges from 20 to 70 percent.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is mucky peat.  The fiber content after rubbing ranges from one-sixth to three-fourths of the volume.  Mineral content, by weight, ranges from 25 to 70 percent.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  In some pedons there are thin subhorizons of organic materials.\nThe 2Cg horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is loamy sand or sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Boxiron soils are located in estuarine and coastal tidal marshes of the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain.  They formed in silty marine and alluvial sediments that are flooded by brackish tidal water twice daily.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mispillion, Transquaking, Bestpitch, Sunken, and Broadkill soils.  Bestpitch, Transquaking, and Mispillion soils are histosols and occur at similar elevations within the marsh.  Broadkill soils are commonly intermingled with Boxiron.. Sunken soils are found at slightly higher elevations within the marsh."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. These soils become extremely acid to ultra acid when drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Histic epipedon:  the zone between 0 and 14 inches.\nb. Fibric material:  the zone between 0 and 7 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths of the soil volume.\nc. Hemic soil material:  the zone between 7 and 14 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is one-third of the soil volume.\nd. Moist incubation study indicates these soils have sulfidic materials.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
