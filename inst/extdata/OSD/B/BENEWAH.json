    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benewah soils are on mountain footslopes and foothills. Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent. The soils formed in reworked loess and tertiary alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations range from 2,540 to 3,500 feet. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Ardenvoir soils are loamy-skeletal and are on steeper adjacent mountain slopes. Porrett soils have an aquic moisture regime and are in bottomlands and drainageways. Rasser soils are loamy-skeletal and are on similar convex positions. Santa and Reggear soils have a fragipan at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are on adjacent hills. Hobo and Threebear soils are udic, have thick volcanic ash mantles and are on adjacent hills and dissected terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon the zone from 18 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nVitrandic feature the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap and part of the BE horizon)\nParticle-size control section the zone from 18 to 38 inches ((Bt1, Bt2, and part of the Bt3 horizon)\nUltic feature - the zone from 18 to 48 inches having an assumed base saturation (sum) of less than 75 percent in any horizon.\nClassification changed in 2002 from Ultic Haploxeralfs fine-silty, mixed, frigid to Vitrandic Haploxeralfs fine-silty, isotic, frigid due to revision in soil taxonomy.\nNote: The Benewah series is currently only recognized within the Benewah County, Idaho soil survey. The original concept of the series was that of a soil recognized as having a fragipan. After thorough investigation, this series has been revised to not include a zone within the Bt horizon which meets the definition of a fragipan. In addition, the revised concept includes an influence of mixed ash and loess within the upper part of the soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
