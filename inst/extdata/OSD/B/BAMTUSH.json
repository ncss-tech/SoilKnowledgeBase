The soil moisture control section (8 to 28 inches) is dry in all parts from early July to mid October (105 days) and is moist in all parts from mid December to mid May.  The particle-size control section (17 to 37 inches) is 25 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent sandstone rock fragments.  Base saturation is 60 to 70 percent at the surface and decreases with depth to about 50 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 7/3; 7.5YR 4/4, or 5/4. Moist color 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 3/3, 3/2, 2/2; 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  The texture is mainly gravelly loam and commonly is 18 to 25 percent clay and 15 to 75 percent gravel.

Chromas are greater than 4 in at least the lowest Bt2 horizon.  The texture is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam and commonly is 22 to 35 percent clay.  The clay content continues to increase in the lower part of the Bt horizon and increases or decreases only slightly in the lowest Bt horizon.  Total rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent, and consist of cobbles that range from 0 to 10 percent and pebbles that range from 35 to 55 percent.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid."
