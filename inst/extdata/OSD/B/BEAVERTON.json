  "OVERVIEW": "The Beaverton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium or glacial outwash materials.  These soils have extremely gravelly sand at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Beaverton soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe family classification was changed from Loamy-skeletal to Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal in 1993."
