This zone is assumed to have silt-sized and larger pellets and cracked coatings.\nburied cambic horizon - from 33 to 50 inches.\nParticle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches with 0 to 18 inches qualifying as ashy-pumiceous and 18 to 40 qualifying as ashy-skeletal.  Family particle-size class is based on the thickest layer or ashy-skeletal.\nClassification changed 7/98 based on 1998 Keys to Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
