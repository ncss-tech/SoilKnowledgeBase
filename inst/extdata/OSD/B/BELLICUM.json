  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellicum series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in pumice, volcanic ash and porphoritic andesite.  Bellicum soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of l,800 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees  F.",

This zone is assumed to have silt-sized and larger pellets and cracked coatings.\nburied cambic horizon - from 33 to 50 inches.\nParticle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches with 0 to 18 inches qualifying as ashy-pumiceous and 18 to 40 qualifying as ashy-skeletal.  Family particle-size class is based on the thickest layer or ashy-skeletal.\nClassification changed 7/98 based on 1998 Keys to Taxonomy."
