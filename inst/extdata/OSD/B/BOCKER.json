    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon\n*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm\n*Depth to lithic contact--25 cm\n*Particle-size control section--zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm\nFurther investigation is needed to determine the degree and uniformity of the ash influence. Extensive areas were mapped before and after the Andisol order was established. This has resulted in recognition of ashy modifiers and vitrandic criteria in some survey areas but not in others. Both are included in the current concept of the Bocker series in areas where the shallow and skeletal soil characteristics are the dominant features that affect use and management. The relationship of aspect and an ash influence should be considered; north-facing slopes may be best correlated to an ash influence and south-facing slopes to no ash influence.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
