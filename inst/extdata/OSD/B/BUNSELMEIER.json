  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location was moved to the Big Valley Soil Survey Area and reclassified.  These soils are the oldest of the cinder cone sequence mapped in Big Valley soil survey area.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 12 inches (A, BA).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 25 inches (Bt1, Bt2).\nMineralogy - the clay fraction is dominated by halloysite.  Gravel identified as cinders and makes up 56 percent of the soil by volume.  More than 50 percent of the clay fraction was identified as halloysite by DTA.  Lincoln laboratory data for the Bt2 showed the glass content as 7 percent.\nAndic properties data defined and referenced in the soil taxonomy andisol amendment:\nP-ret: phosphate retention of the less than 2mm fraction.\nB.D.: bulk density of the less than 2mm fraction on an oven dry basis.\npH NaF: pH of soil mixed with saturated sodium floride solution.\nGlass: percent volcanic glass.\nAlo: acid-oxalate-extractable aluminum of the less than 2mm fraction.\nFeo: acid-oxalate-extractable iron of the less than 2mm fraction.\n15 bar H20: dried 1500 kPa water retention as a percent.\nData elements with a * are estimated.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNC: not calculated.\nND: not done.\nAdditional Data:  A grab sample (Bt2) was sent to Lincoln and another private lab used by BLM.  Pedon number is S83CA-35-1 and sample number is 7718, unpublished.  UC Davis laboratory sample number 1691.\nThis pedon was characterized by UC Davis Laboratory, sample number, 88CA-089-05-(1-5) unpublished, Lab #1691.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
