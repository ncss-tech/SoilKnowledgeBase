  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 48 to more than 72 inches.  The solum and underlying material have a high content of fine sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A and E horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4; 6 or more dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. It is loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand. Depth to the top of Bt horizon is 24 to 39 inches.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is similar to the A and E horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It typically is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Clay content commonly averages from 12 to 20 percent and ranges from about 9 to 25 percent. The Bt horizon commonly has mottles with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe CB horizon, when present, has lamellae of sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Some pedons have a C horizon with dominant texture of loamy sand or loamy fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in the same family. Similar soils include the Beulah, Bosket, and Farrenburg series. Beulah soils lack argillic horizons. The Bosket and Farrenburg soils have fine sandy loam A horizons and horizons above the Bt with textures finer than loamy fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broseley soils are on nearly level, undulating and sloping natural levees or terraces of Late Pleistocene Age. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent, but slope gradients typically are 0 to 6 percent. Broseley soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits. Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F, and annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Bosket and Farrenburg soils and the Canalou, Clana, Dubbs, Dundee, Forestdale, Malden, and Scotco soils. Bosket soils are on similar positions. Farrenburg soils are in lower positions. Canalou and Clana soils are on nearly level areas below the Broseley soils and are wetter. Dubbs soils occur on similar landscapes but have finer textures in the upper 20 inches. Dundee and Forestdale soils occur on nearly level areas or in depressions below the Broseley soils and have finer textures in the upper 20 inches. Malden and Scotco soils occur above the Broseley soils and lack argillic horizons."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 37 inches (Ap and E horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 37 to 63 inches\n(Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3) horizons; the upper and lower boundary is not distinct because of lamellae in the soil profile; udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
