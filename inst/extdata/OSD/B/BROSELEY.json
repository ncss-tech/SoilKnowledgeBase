  "BYREV": "Rev. RLT-LJG",
  "REVDATE": "10/2018",
  "STATES": "AR,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Broseley series consists of deep, well and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits. Permeability is moderately rapid. These soils are on nearly level, undulating, and sloping natural levees or terraces of Late Pleistocene Age. Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A and E horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4; 6 or more dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. It is loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand. Depth to the top of Bt horizon is 24 to 39 inches.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is similar to the A and E horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It typically is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Clay content commonly averages from 12 to 20 percent and ranges from about 9 to 25 percent. The Bt horizon commonly has mottles with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe CB horizon, when present, has lamellae of sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Some pedons have a C horizon with dominant texture of loamy sand or loamy fine sand."

Bosket soils are on similar positions. Farrenburg soils are in lower positions. Canalou and Clana soils are on nearly level areas below the Broseley soils and are wetter. Dubbs soils occur on similar landscapes but have finer textures in the upper 20 inches. Dundee and Forestdale soils occur on nearly level areas or in depressions below the Broseley soils and have finer textures in the upper 20 inches. Malden and Scotco soils occur above the Broseley soils and lack argillic horizons."
