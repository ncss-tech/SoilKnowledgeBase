  "OVERVIEW": "The Bramard series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt. Bramard soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

The parent materials are colluvium or residuum from basalt. In places the soils overlie sediments. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches, including about 7 to 15 feet of snowfall.
