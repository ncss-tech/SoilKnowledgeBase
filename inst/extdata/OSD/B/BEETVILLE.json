Kodak soils have C and Ab horizons below 50cm with 10 to 20 percent organic matter and average annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. Dressler soils have 3 to 9 percent clay content in the particle-size control section and a cambic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beetville soils are nearly level on stream terraces and flood-plain steps at elevations of 2,475 to 4,800 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in stratified, moderately coarse textured alluvium from mixed rock sources, dominantly quartzite and rhyolite. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Average annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free period is 100 to 155 days."

An erroneous location (township) is also corrected.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - zone from 0 to 13 inches (A horizon)\nIrregular decrease in organic-carbon - zone from 13 to 49 inches (stratified C horizon)\nStripped matrix - zone from 49 to 60 inches (2Ck horizon)\nSoil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric\nThe faint Fe concentrations that occur in the upper profile are assumed to be result of flood irrigation.\nCarbonates in the Ck1 and 2Ck2 horizons are assumed to be primary (not secondary).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
