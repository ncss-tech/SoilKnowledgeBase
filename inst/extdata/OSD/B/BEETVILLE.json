  "OVERVIEW": "The Beetville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified, moderately coarse textured alluvium dominantly from quartzite and rhyolite. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent on pediments and in valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
