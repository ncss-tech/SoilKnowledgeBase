  "BYREV": "Rev. KRW-LMC-JJJ",
  "REVDATE": "06/2011",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Betsy Bay series consists of moderately deep or deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on sandstone bedrock lake benches.  These soils formed in sandy beach deposits or sandy residuum from the sandstone.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and moderately slow in the sandstone bedrock.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is sand, fine sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or flaggy analogs of these textures.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam or flaggy or very flaggy analogs of these textures.\nThe R horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4."
