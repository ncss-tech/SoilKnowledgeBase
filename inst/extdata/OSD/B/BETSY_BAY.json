Textures in the transitional layer to bedrock include loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam.  Gravel and cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent and flagstones range from 0 to 25 percent in the upper part and 0 to 40 percent in the lower part. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is sand, fine sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or flaggy analogs of these textures.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam or flaggy or very flaggy analogs of these textures.\nThe R horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4."
