  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to very strongly acid in the A and Bt horizons, except where limed, and from very strongly acid to extremely acid in the Btx and BC horizons.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 19 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 4 through 8.  In most pedons the lower Bt horizon has few to common mottles in shades of yellow, brown, gray, and red.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay and more than 30 percent silt.\nThe Btx horizon is mottled in shades of yellow, red, brown, and gray or it has a matrix hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 3 through 8 with common to many mottles of chroma 2 or less.  Percent brittleness is 60 to 90.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe BC horizon has the same hue, value, chroma, and texture as the Btx horizon."
