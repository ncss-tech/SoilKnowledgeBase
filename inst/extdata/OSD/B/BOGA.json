Rupture resistance ranges from slightly hard to very hard and varies within the same horizon.  The densic material does not slake in water and the cementation class is noncemented.  This material usually has many very fine and fine tubular pores that appear to be remnant root channels.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
