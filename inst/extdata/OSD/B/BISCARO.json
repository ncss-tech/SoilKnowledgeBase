    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Biscaro soils are on slightly dissected lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from interbedded tuffaceous siltstone and fine grained sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,400 to 5,350 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches including 15 to 20 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of December 2003 updates the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, mesic Xeric Paleargids and recognizes the Bq horizon as meeting durinodic subgroup criteria.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 3 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 14 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nPaleargid great group feature - The abrupt clay increase of more than 15 percent at 3 inches (between the A and Bt1 horizons).\nDuric feature - The zone from 14 to 24 inches (Bq horizon).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 38 inches to soft, weathered bedrock (2Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 3 to 14 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location was reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S82CA-035-001-1 through 3.  These were temporary horizon samples and the data are not stored in the SSL characterization database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
