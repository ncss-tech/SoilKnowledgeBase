  "OVERVIEW": "The Burgraff series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from soft sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
