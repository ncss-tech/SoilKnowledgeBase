  "OVERVIEW": "The Boxwell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from semiconsolidated sedimentary beds consisting of sandstone, shale, siltstone, mudstone, or an interbedded mixture of these materials.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
