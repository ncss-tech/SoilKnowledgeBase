  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Contents of coarse fragments average 5 to 40 percent in the A horizons, 20 to 60 percent in the B horizons and 40 to 80 percent in the C horizons.  Most fragments are slightly weathered hornblende schist, gneiss, quartz, feldspar crystals, greenstone, or other dark colored rocks.  The soil is strongly acid to medium acid throughout.\nA horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 8 with value of 3 restricted to Al horizons.  The A horizons are silt loam, loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly loam.\nB horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  They have mottles of various colors in most pedons.  They ar gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam.  Thin or discontinuous lenses or pockets of silty clay loam or clay loam are in the B horizon of some pedons, but there is no or little evidence of illuvial clay.\nC horizons have colors that are inherited from the bedrock.  These colors consist of various shades of gray, black, brown, red and green.  C horizons are very gravelly or gravelly analogues of loam, silt loam or sandy loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  Bremo is the only known series in this family.  Other closely related series are the Brandywine, Goldston, Hazel, Louisburg, Manteo, Pinkston, Watt, and Wilkes series.  Brandywine soils are in areas that have annual temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  Goldston soils have coarse fragments dominated by slate and have siliceous mineralogy.  Hazel, Louisburg, and Pinkston soils contain less than 35 percent of coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Manteo soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches.  Watt soils have moist values of 3 or less in the Ap horizon.  Wilkes soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bremo soils are on narrow ridgetops and sideslopes in strongly dissected uplands of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slope gradients are mostly between 7 and 15 percent and the extreme range is 2 to 45 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from dark colored rocks.  The underlying rocks are mostly hornblende schist and gneiss, amphibolite, and hornblende gabbro.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 45 inches."

Principal crops are corn, small grain,  dark tobacco, and mixed hay.  The native vegetation is red, black, white and scarlet oaks, hickory, dogwood, Virginia and shortleaf pines, and redbud."
