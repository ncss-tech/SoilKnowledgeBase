  "OVERVIEW": "The Bravo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Bravo soils are on side slopes of mountains and have slopes of 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
