  "OVERVIEW": "The BUTTONFLAT series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on floodplain steps.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
