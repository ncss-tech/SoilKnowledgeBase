  "OVERVIEW": "The Boontling series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Boontling soils are on river terrace platforms and associated scarps and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 6 and 19 inches is dry in all parts from August 1 to October 1 and is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 15 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 22 to 35 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Base saturation is greater than 50 percent throughout and less than 75 percent in upper 30 inches.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3. Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Organic carbon content ranges from 0.6 to 2.0 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 75 percent.  Soil reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5Y 6/4; 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4.

Matrix or mottle colors with chromas of 2 occur between a depth of 30 to 40 inches and continue to a depth of 60 inches or more. The Bt horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, clay, gravelly sandy clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 22 to 27 percent in the upper part and 22 to 45 percent in the lower part.  Clay content in the upper 20 inches averages 33 percent or less.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Gravelly textures, when they occur, usually are below a depth of 40 inches.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 75 to 90 percent.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral."
