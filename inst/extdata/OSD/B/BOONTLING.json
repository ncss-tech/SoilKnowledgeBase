    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 19 inches is dry in all parts from August 1 to October 1 and is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 15 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 22 to 35 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Base saturation is greater than 50 percent throughout and less than 75 percent in upper 30 inches.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3. Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Organic carbon content ranges from 0.6 to 2.0 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 75 percent.  Soil reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5Y 6/4; 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4.   Mottle colors are 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2; 10YR 6/4, 6/6 or 6/8.  Moist mottle colors are 2.5Y 5/2; 10YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6 or 5/8.  Matrix or mottle colors with chromas of 2 occur between a depth of 30 to 40 inches and continue to a depth of 60 inches or more. The Bt horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, clay, gravelly sandy clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 22 to 27 percent in the upper part and 22 to 45 percent in the lower part.  Clay content in the upper 20 inches averages 33 percent or less.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Gravelly textures, when they occur, usually are below a depth of 40 inches.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 75 to 90 percent.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral."

The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources, mainly sedimentary rocks and to a lesser extent, schist.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 175 to 250 days."

Cole, Feliz, and Talmage soils occur on lower landscape positions, on relatively younger stream terraces.  Cole soils formed in fine textured alluvium and are fine.  Feliz and Talmage soils lack mottling and are well or somewhat excessively drained. Pinole and Perrygulch soils occur on older stream terraces.  Pinole soils lack mottling and are well drained.  Perrygulch soils are fine."
