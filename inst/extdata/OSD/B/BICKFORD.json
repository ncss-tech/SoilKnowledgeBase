The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry between depths of approximately 4 to 12 inches for less than 40 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than fine sand.   The lower particle-size control section has 50 to 65 percent clay.  The soil has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 50 to 75 percent throughout the profile.  A perched water table is at 0.5 to 1.5 feet from November to May.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry, chroma of 2 moist and dry, and distinct or prominent masses of iron accumulations.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2BCg or 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with 50 to 65 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid to extremely acid.   It has prominent masses of iron accumulation having hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 , and chroma of 4 to 8."

Elevations are 250 to 750 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches.  The frost free period is 160 to 240 days."

Blachly and Orford soils are clayey and on adjacent side slopes.   Bohannon and Damewood soils are moderately deep and on adjacent more steeply sloping side slopes.  Kirkendall and Nekoma soils are well drained and on flood plains.  Natal soils are poorly drained and on terraces.  Meda soils are fine-loamy and are also on toeslopes and footslopes.  Preacher soils are fine-loamy and on adjacent more steeply sloping side slopes.  Wintley soils are clayey and on terraces."
