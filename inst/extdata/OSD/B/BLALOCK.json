  "OVERVIEW": "The Blalock series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium reworked by wind.  Blalock soils are on old alluvial terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are usually dry in all parts of the soil above the duripan.  Mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 56 degree F.  Some pedons have secondary lime above the duripan.  Depth to weathered shale commonly is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is loam or gravelly loam and averages 18 to 25 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. This horizon has weak medium subangular blocky or weak medium prismatic structure."

They formed in medium textured mixed alluvium reworked by wind.  The climate is semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  Mean winter temperature is 34 to 36 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 71 to 73 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.
