  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are usually dry in all parts of the soil above the duripan.  Mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 56 degree F.  Some pedons have secondary lime above the duripan.  Depth to weathered shale commonly is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is loam or gravelly loam and averages 18 to 25 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. This horizon has weak medium subangular blocky or weak medium prismatic structure."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gorst and Moxee soils in the same family and the Baker and Willis series.  Baker and Willis soils have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Also, Willis soils have less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Gorst soils have a noncalcareous duripan thicker than 12 inches.  Moxee soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING;  Blalock soils are on old river terraces at elevations of 500 to 900 feet and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in medium textured mixed alluvium reworked by wind.  The climate is semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  Mean winter temperature is 34 to 36 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 71 to 73 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 190 days."
