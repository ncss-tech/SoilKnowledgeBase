  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Borrego series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed gravelly materials from Precambrian granite, gneiss and schist.  Borrego soils are on upland slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

They formed in mixed gravelly materials of medium to fine textures that have weathered from Precambrian granite, gneiss and schist. At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 47 degrees F. The climate is subhumid, continental. The precipitation occurs as snowfall in the winter and as rain in late June, July, August, and early September."
