    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Borrego soils are on strongly sloping to moderately steep upland slopes at elevations ranging from 8,000 to 9,000 feet. They formed in mixed gravelly materials of medium to fine textures that have weathered from Precambrian granite, gneiss and schist. At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 47 degrees F. The climate is subhumid, continental. The precipitation occurs as snowfall in the winter and as rain in late June, July, August, and early September."
