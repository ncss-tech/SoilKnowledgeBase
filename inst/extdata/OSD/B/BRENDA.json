Blackmagic, Cornville, Dona Ana, Elizario, Hap, Kidwell, Madurez, Mcnew, Nutt, Poachie and Tres Hermanos soils do not have gravelly sand or fine sand in the lower part of the profile below the argillic horizon. Blackmagic and Jagerson soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and receive most of the precipitation in the winter. Mohave soils are in the Sonoran Desert and Sonoran-Chihuahuan transition (MLRAs 40 & 41) and have a bi-modal precipitation pattern."

They formed in moderately fine and moderately coarse textured gravelly, calcareous material derived from alluvial outwash from the Santa Fe formation. The climate is semiarid with an average annual rainfall of 8 to 10 inches with a distinct summer maximum. The average annual temperature is 60 degrees F."

The particle-size control section is not strongly contrasting. Even though the A horizon and the Bt1 horizon have mollic colors, this soil is not moist long enough to have a mollic epipedon."
