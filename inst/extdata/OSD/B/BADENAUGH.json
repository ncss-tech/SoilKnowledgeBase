  "OVERVIEW": "The Badenaugh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Badenaugh soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
