  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowery series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, flood-plain steps, swales, stream terraces, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
