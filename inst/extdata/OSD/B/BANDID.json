    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the pumice layer is 11 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is ashy (A1, A2, A3, and 2Bw1) over pumiceous or cindery (3Bw2) over ashy (3Bw3, 3Bw4, and 4Bw5).  Pumice fragments in the upper part of the control section averages from 5 to 20 percent and pebbles average from 10 to 30 percent.  The layer of pumice is 10 to 14 inches thick and contains 60 to 80 percent cinders and 10 to 20 percent pebbles.  Pumice fragments in the lower part of the control section averages from 10 to 30 percent.  This soil is more than 60 percent by weight vitric volcanic ash and pumice throughout.  Soil reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Pumice fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bandid soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains at elevations of l,800 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 99 percent.  Bandid soils formed in aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material from Mt. St. Helens present in Bandid soil profiles is: (l) fresh ash and pumice including the 176-year-old \"Layer T\", (2) and (3) pumice of the 400-year-old \"Layer W\" and (4) ash, pumice and scoria of the2,500 year-old \"B set.\"  The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 125 to 135 inches, including snow cover from December to April.  Average January temperature is 30 degrees F.; average July temperature is 6l degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
