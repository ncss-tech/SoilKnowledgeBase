  "STATES": "ID,OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barbermill series consists of shallow, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in alluvium from volcaniclastic sediments. Barbermill soils are on foothills and have slopes of 2 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
