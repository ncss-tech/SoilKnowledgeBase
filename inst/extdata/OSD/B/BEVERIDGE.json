    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON:  Beveridge very gravelly sandy loam - on a moderately steep, convex mountain slope, under low sagebrush and Indian ricegrass native vegetation, at 8,700 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on 6/5/79 the soil was moist between depths of 25 and 48 cm.) The soil surface littered with shale fragments; 40 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles.\nA--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine vesicular and interstitial pores; 40 percent by volume gravel and 2 percent to cobbles limestone fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 8 cm thick)\nAC--8 to 25 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular and interstitial pores; 35 percent by volume gravel limestone fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) abrupt wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 25 to 50 cm.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 4.4 degrees to 8.3 degrees C.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 15.6 degrees to 18.3 degrees C.  The soil is slightly to strongly effervescent throughout.  The soils are dry from mid July to mid October, soil temperatures are warmer than 5 degrees C. from mid June to October 1 for about 105 days.   The soils are moist only 15 to 30 consecutive days when the soil temperature is warmer than 8.3 degrees C.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 6/3, or 7/3 and moist color of 3/2, 4/2, or 5/2.  Organic matter averages less than 1 percent.  The upper 5 or 8 cm is usually weakly vesicular.  Rock fragments consist of gravel and cobbles and range from 35 to 70 percent.  Clay averages 10 to 18 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3 or 7/3.  It has textures similar to the A and includes extremely cobbly loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beveridge soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from hard, fractured, calcareous shale, dolomite, and other carbonate sedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 2,425 to 3,360 meters.  The climate consists of mild, dry summers with infrequent thundershowers of short durations; and cold, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm.  Mean January temperature is about -1 degrees C.; mean July temperature is about 21 degrees C.; and mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 100 to 185 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to  18 cm (A and part of the AC horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 25 to 48 cm (Ck horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 48 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - 25 to 48 cm (Bk horizon).Future study should evaluate whether this series has an aridic (torric) moisture regime that borders on xeric and should be reclassified to the subgroup of Lithic Xeric Torriorthents if a calcic horizon is not present, or to Lithic Xeric Haplocalcids if otherwise.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
