Cleavage, Cleavmor, Gaciba, Genoa, Gidwin, Hutchley, Mascamp, Melling, Pernog, Pernty, Rozara, Shalcleav, Shalper, Slatter, and Tweener soils are not intermittently moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.  Celeridge soils are derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite have a mollic thickness of 36 to 50 cm, and have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.Cleavmor soils have mollic epipedons 36 to 50 cm thick and have Btk horizons.  Cropper soils are slightly alkaline in the lower part of the Bt horizon and have less than 40 percent sand greater than very fine sand in the Bt.  Gabica soils are derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite or rhyolite. Gerdog soils are 18 to 36 cm deep to a lithic contact.\nGidwin soils have less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and mollic epipedons 36 to 50 cm thick.\nGrandeposit soils have Bt horizons that are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Granquin soil have 15 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction and have rock fragments of welded tuff.  Grosschat soils lack 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 25 to 36 cm to bedrock. Hawkridge soils have a typic xeric soil moisture regime and are derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite. Hutchley soils have mollic epipedons that include all of their Bt horizons.\nLoope soils have a mollic epipedon thickness of 36 to 50 cm and are derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite. Majorsplace soils have a Bk horizon with seconday carbonates. Mascamp soils are dominated by stones and cobbles in the control section, are influenced by volcanic glass, and have secondary carbonates coats on bedrock.  Melling soils have a typic xeric soil moisture regime. Pernog soils have less than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Realmcoy soils are not intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. Rozara, Shalper, Slatter and Tweener soils are less than 36 cm to bedrock.  Shalcleav soils have bedrock within 30 cm, have mollic epipedons that include all of the Bt horizon and their particle-size control section is dominated by flagstones and channers.  Tractuff soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 2,010 to 2,680 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm.The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
