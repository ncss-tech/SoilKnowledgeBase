  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches thick. Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 4 percent and decreases uniformly with depth. The soils are 60 to 90 percent base saturated. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the particle size control section but range as high as 25 percent in Colorado.. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 50 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. This horizon is neutral through moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand with less than 35 percent but more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser. Oriented clay films occur in some parts of this horizon. This horizon is neutral through moderately acid. Some pedons may have thin C horizons above the bedrock."

Benteen, Senchert, and Squawval soils are neutral or slightly alkaline. Cambern soils formed in materials from ash and tuff and overlies tuff or ash. Bavdark, Clayburn, Croydon, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Decross, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Gordo, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Pontuge, Southmount, and Thulepah soils lack bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Dranyon soils also have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the solum. Echemoor Squawval and Stubbs soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Vadnais soils formed in loess over basalt. Winu soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from igneous rock and have summer soil temperature of 58 or 59 degrees F."

The soils formed in noncalcareous alluvium weathered from underlying quartzitic sandstone. The average annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 33 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 48 to 56 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 90 days."
