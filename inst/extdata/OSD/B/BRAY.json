The soil formed in loess over weathered loess.  The soils are in a semiarid climate with annual precipitation of 11 to 13 inches.  This soil receives additional moisture from run on from surrounding areas.  The average annual temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 85 to 100 days."
