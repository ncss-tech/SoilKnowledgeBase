  "OVERVIEW": "The Beeox series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources that are thinly mantled by loess and volcanic ash.  The Beeox soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
