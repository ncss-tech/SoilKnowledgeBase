Churn soils lack paragravel textures below 100 centimeters. Loafercreek soils have hard bedrock above 100 centimeters. Mounthope and Sommeyflat soils formed in igneous rocks, Mounthope soils have a paralithic contact at 100 to 150 centimeters and Sommeyflat soils have a paralithic contact at 152 to 203 centimeters. Wisheylu soils have a paralithic contact of basic igneous bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 centimeters and have 2.5Y hues in the lower profile."

They formed in material weathered from sandstone or shale at elevations of 61 to 915 meters (200 to 3,000 feet).  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 1650 millimeters (35 to 65 inches).  Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C (44 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F); mean annual temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C (53 degrees to 59 degrees F).  Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 250 days."
