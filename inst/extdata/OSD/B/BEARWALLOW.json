  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearwallow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from soft sandstone or shale.  Bearwallow soils are deep to moderately or weakly cemented paralithic material with fractures less than 10 centimeters apart.  Bearwallow soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1070 millimeters (42 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",
