  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to sand or gravelly sands ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 34 inches in thickness.  Typically carbonates are leached below a depth of 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam and ranges from sandy loam to silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture is loam to clay loam with clay content ranging from 18 to 33 percent.  The Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 and textures similar to the Bt1.  Reaction in the Bt horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The BC horizon ranges from silt loam to gravelly loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It contains from 8 to 45 percent gravel by volume.  It is sand, coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Jansen and O'Neill soils are on similar landscapes.  Meadin soils are less than 20 inches thick over gravelly sands and contain more than 35 percent gravel in the particle size control section.  They are on steeper hill slopes and ridge tops."
