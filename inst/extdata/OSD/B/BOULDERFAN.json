  "OVERVIEW": "The Boulderfan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till and glacial debris, volcanic ash, alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite and andesitic tuff. Boulderfan soils are on ground moraines and mountain valleys. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
