  "OVERVIEW": "The Baller series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone. Baller soils are on upland hills, hogbacks and homoclinal ridges in the foothills of central Colorado.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
