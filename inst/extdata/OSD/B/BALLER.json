  "OVERVIEW": "The Baller series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Baller soils are on upland hills and ridges and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick and depth to the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Organic carbon ranges from .7 to about 2 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated.  The matrix material of the control section is typically fine sandy loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 35 percent, and sand from 52 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 35 to about 75 percent by volume and consist mainly of stones and cobbles.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 72 degrees F.  The time the soil temperature at depths of 20 inches is 41 degrees F or higher ranges from about 230 to 305 days.  Cumulative time the soil is moist in some part of the moisture control section and soil temperature at depths of 20 inches is 41 degrees F or higher ranges from about 56 to 152 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8).  This horizon usually has fine granular structure but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8).  This horizon is generally noncalcareous but is inconsistently calcareous in the few inches immediately above the bedrock in some pedons.  This horizon is absent in some pedons and the mollic epipedon extends to the bedrock."

Faraway soils contain rock fragments mainly of gravel size and contain less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Oro Grande soils are calcareous throughout and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Santa soils have more than 18 percent clay and less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section."

The average annual temperature is 48 degrees F, the average summer temperature is 68 degrees F."
