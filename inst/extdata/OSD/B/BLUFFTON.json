  "REVDATE": "11/2004",
  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluffton series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, soils that formed in a mantle of loamy alluvium from glacial till and in underlying loamy glacial till on glacial moraines. These soils have moderately rapid or moderate permeability in the upper part and moderate or moderately slow permeability in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to free carbonates commonly are 15 to 44 inches, but ranges to greater than 60 inches in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 24 inches thick.  The series control section has 18 to 30 percent clay, 45 to 65 percent sand, and 10 to 15 percent very fine sand.  Content of rock fragments of mixed lithology ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the upper part to a few pebbles to 10 percent in the lower part.  Textural change with depth in these soils commonly is erratic.  Some pedons have an O horizon as much as 6 inches in thickness.  The soil moisture control section is saturated for 20 to 60 days in most years following the summer solstice unless artificially drained.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2 or is N 2/ or N 3/.  It has mottles in some pedons.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  The A horizon is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bk horizons are present in some pedons.  They have properties similar to the C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It mostly is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam, but subhorizons with coarser texture are in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Flom soils have less than 45 percent sand in the series control section.  Larry and Wyard soils are substantially drier in the moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Also, Larry soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Mahtowa soils have hue 5YR or redder in the lower part of the control section.    The Mann soils have more than 45 percent silt and less than 20 percent fine sand or coarser in the upper part of the control section and high density soil materials in the lower part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have concave slopes with gradients less than 2 percent in depressions, swales, and drainageways on glacial moraines.  At least the upper part of the solum formed in loamy local alluvium from glacial till.  The lower part of the solum or the C horizon is loamy till of the Des Moines Lobe including the St. Louis and Grantsburg sublobes of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  Mean air annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1500 feet."

The Bluffton soils are members of both the Nebish-Beltrami-Shooker hydrosequence and the Cushing-Alstad hydrosequence.  The well drained Nebish and Cushing soils have convex slopes and are on higher lying more sloping terrain.  The moderately well drained Beltrami soils have nearly level to gently undulating plane or slightly convex slopes.  The somewhat poorly drained Alstad and poorly drained Shooker and Talmoon soils have nearly level slightly convex to slightly concave slopes.  Organic soils such as Cathro and Seelyeville are common associates in some places."
