It is dry in some or all parts the rest of the time. It is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days. Organic matter is more than 1 percent throughout. The soil is medium or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 2/1, 3/2 or 2/2. It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam and has moderate fine granular to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure. Consistence is slightly hard or hard. Gravel ranges from 35 to 50 percent of the soil by volume. Base saturation is 50 to 80 percent.\nThe B2 horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 2/1, 3/2 or 2/2.
