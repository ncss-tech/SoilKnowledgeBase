  "OVERVIEW": "The Bayview series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from siliceous sandstone and shale. Bayview soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is less than 9 degrees F. The soil moisture control section is usually moist in all part from mid-November to June. It is dry in some or all parts the rest of the time. It is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days. Organic matter is more than 1 percent throughout. The soil is medium or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 2/1, 3/2 or 2/2. It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam and has moderate fine granular to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure. Consistence is slightly hard or hard. Gravel ranges from 35 to 50 percent of the soil by volume. Base saturation is 50 to 80 percent.\nThe B2 horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 2/1, 3/2 or 2/2. It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam, and has strong fine and medium or moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure. Gravel ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Base saturation is 50 to 65 percent."
