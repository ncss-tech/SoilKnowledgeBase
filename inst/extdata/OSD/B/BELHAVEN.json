    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThickness of Organic Layers: 16 to 51 inches\nDepth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches\nDepth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 12 inches, November to May\nSoil Reaction: Organic layers are ultra acid to extremely acid (in 0.01 M CaCl2) except where the surface has been limed. The underlying mineral horizons are extremely acid through moderately alkaline\nFiber content of Oa horizons: 15 percent to 45 percent unrubbed and less than 10 percent rubbed. The amount of fiber is highest in the lower tier. The organic material of this layer has a slick feel and is paste-like(colloidal). It is massive under natural wet conditions. Upon aeration after drainage, structure of the organic material evolves. Excessive drying causes shrinkage and hard subangular blocky peds to form. These peds dry irreversibly.\nOther Features: Logs, stumps, and fragments of wood occupy 0 to 5 percent of the upper organic horizons in cleared areas that are cultivated and 5 to 35 percent in undrained areas. Pieces of charcoal range from common (2 to 8 percent) in the upper tier to few (less than 2 percent) in the lower tiers\nOa horizon (upper tier):\nColor--hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. Ten inches or more of the upper tier is in hue of 5YR or 2.5YR\nTexture--muck\nOa horizon (lower tier):\nColor--hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3\nTexture--muck\nAC horizon or A horizon (where present):\nColor--hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3\nTexture--fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, and includes the mucky texture modifier\nC horizon (where present):\nColor--hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3\nTexture--sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam\nCg horizon:\nColor--hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, 5GY or 5G, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 , or is neutral with value of 4 to 7. The low chroma colors are the result of iron depletion caused by wetness.\nTexture--sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam or is stratified sandy to clayey sediment.\nRedoximorphic features (where present)--masse of oxidized iron in shades of brown, yellow, or red and iron depletions in shades of gray, olive, or white"
