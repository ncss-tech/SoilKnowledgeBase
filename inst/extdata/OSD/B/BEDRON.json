    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 25 to 40 inches and includes part of the argillic horizon.  The upper 10 to 20 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 7 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 40 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has 5 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the A horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  I is clay loam or gravelly clay loam.\nThe 2Bt1 and 2Bt3 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The 2Bt2 horizon is clay loam, gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.  The 2Bt3 horizon is gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.  The smaller structural units is moderate medium subangular blocky or strong medium angular blocky."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bedron soils are on east, west and north-facing hillslopes and have slopes of 15 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in interbedded sediments, slope alluvium that contains basalt fragments and loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface.  Elevation is 2,300 to 3,400 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winter.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  These soils soils receive extra moisture as runoff from shallow soils above and from moisture moving through the interbeds in the basalt.  Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 135 days."
