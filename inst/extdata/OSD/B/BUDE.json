Between a depth of 10 inches and the upper boundary of the fragipan the clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent and the sand content is less than 15 percent. Below the B horizon of the upper sequence and within a depth of 48 inches from the surface, sand content is more than 15 percent.

Some undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have an E horizon. Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.

They formed in a silty mantle that is less than 4 feet thick overlying loamy sediments. The climate is humid subtropical. The average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall ranges from 56 to 58 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent."

The poorly drained Henry soils are in depressions or nearly level areas in uplands and have coarse-silty control sections.  The poorly drained Mayhew soils are on similar positions but have clayey control sections and are underlain by clayey shale. The moderately well drained Paden soils are on similar positions. The moderately well drained Providence soils are on higher positions and have an argillic horizon above the fragipan."
