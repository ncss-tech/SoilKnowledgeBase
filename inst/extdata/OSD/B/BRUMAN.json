  "OVERVIEW": "The Bruman series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  Bruman soils are on fan terraces, mountainsides and hillsides.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter months, and are dry in all parts of moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches depth is more than 41 degrees F.\nSolum thickness ranges from 31 to 39 inches.  Clay content of the particle size control section averages 8 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragment content is 5 to 60 percent.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam, and very cobbly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent.  It is strongly to violently effervescent.  Reaction in the Bk horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is very cobbly sand, very gravelly loamy sand and very gravelly sand.  Clay content is 1 to 10 percent.  Rock fragment content is 40 to 70 percent.  It is moderately calcareous to strongly calcareous.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline."

(Bk horizon)\nThe classification of the soil was changed from a loamy-skeletal, mixed Borollic Calciorthids to loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Ustic Haplocalcids on 9/94.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
