    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to shale ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4; hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 4. Texture is shaly silt loam, shaly loam, very shaly silt loam, very shaly loam and their channery, very channery, gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly and stony analogs. Shale, chert, novaculite, and sandstone fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. Texture is shaly silt loam, shaly loam, or their very shaly, channery, very channery, gravelly, and very gravelly analogs. Shale, chert, novaculite, and sandstone fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is very shaly silt loam, very shaly loam or their extremely shaly, very channery and extremely channery analogs. Shale and sandstone fragment content ranges from 35 to 85 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is gray, brown, yellow, and red, soft, weakly cemented, acid shale with few thin strata of interbedded sandstone and siltstone. Fines are less than 5 percent\nof volume. Beds are fractured and dip ranges from 35 degrees to near vertical. Hardness of this material on Mohs' scale ranges from 1.5 to 3.0. May contain seams or pockets of soil material."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no known series in the same family. Cataska, Clebit, Goldston, Manteo, Montevallo, Nashoba, Petros, and Pickens series are in closely related families. Cataska and Petros soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 F. Goldston soils are in a siliceous mineralogy class. Manteo, Pickens, and Clebit soils have lithic contact at 20 inches or less. Montevallo soils have Cr horizons of siltstone, or silty shale with dip of less than 35 degrees. In addition, Clebit soils are in a siliceous mineralogy class. Nashoba soils have 20 to 40 inch sola."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bismarck soils are on nearly level valley floors to very steep side slopes of the Ouachita Mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in residuum from tilted, fractured shale containing a few thin strata of sandstone and siltstone. The climate is warm and humid near the type location. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F., and the annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 56 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Avant, Bengal, Bigfork, Carnasaw, Clebit, Littlefir, Mazarn, Mena, Nashoba, Pirum, Sherless, Sherwood, and Yanush series. Avant and Bigfork soils formed in chert residuum, have an argillic horizon, and are on similar and nearby landscapes. Bengal soils, which are on similar landscapes, are 20 to 40 inches deep to soft bedrock. Carnasaw soils, which are on adjacent similar landscapes, are 40 to 60 inches deep over soft bedrock and have an argillic horizon. Clebit soils formed in sandstone residuum, are 10 to 20 inches to hard bedrock, and are on nearby landscapes. Littlefir soils are 20 to 50 inches deep to shale or interbedded shale and sandstone, have an argillic horizon, and are on nearby landscapes. Marzarn soils formed in loamy sediments on adjacent drainageways and intermittent streams. Mena soils formed in pedisediments and old alluvium on adjacent valleys. Nashoba soils have siliceous mineralogy, formed in sandstone residuum, and are on nearby landscapes. Pirum soils, which are on adjacent upland sideslopes, are 22 to 50 inches deep over hard sandstone bedrock and contain less coarse fragments. Sherless soils, which are on adjacent similar landscapes, are 20 to 40 inches deep over soft sandstone bedrock and contain less coarse fragments. Sherwood soils, which are on similar upland sideslopes, are 30 to 60 inches deep over hard sandstone bedrock and contain less coarse fragments. Yanush soils formed in loamy colluvium on colluvial positions."
