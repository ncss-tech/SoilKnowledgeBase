    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to dense till ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The depth to free carbonates is greater than 80 inches. The mantle is typically loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle and 35 to 60 percent in the underlying dense till, but averages less then 35 percent in the particle-size control section.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent with 5 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 2 to 25 percent stones and 0 to 25 boulders. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a thin or discontinuous E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 2 to 25 percent stones and 0 to 25 boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 2 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 45 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel, 2 to 10 percent cobbles, 2 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is dense glacial till with a clay content of 2 to 12 percent and a sand content of 65 to 85 percent. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent with 15 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid."

They formed in a mantle of loamy material and underlying dense Rainy Lobe till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 30 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 1400 to 1900 feet."

The well drained Eveleth and the moderately well drained Eaglesnest soils form a hydrosequence with Babbitt soils. The well drained Conic and moderately well drained Wahlsten soils have bedrock within 40 inches. The moderately well drained Soudan soils have a sandy mantle and are on higher or more sloping positions. The very poorly drained Cathro and Rifle soils formed in organic material and are in depressions."
