Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume above the fragipan, from 0 to 30 in the fragipan, and from 10 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, unless limed, and from strongly through slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6,and chroma of 0 to 3.  Texture of the fine-earth ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture of the fine-earth is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Btx horizon is neutral or has hue of  7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3, and has redoximorphic features with shades of gray, brown and yellow.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.\nThe Calvert, Croton, Doylestown, Robertsville, Sheffield, and Thorndale series may be in the same family when they are classified to the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Calvert and Croton soils have sola less than 40 inches thick. Doylestown soils have 60 to 80 percent silt in the textural\ncontrol section.  Robertsville soils do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Sheffield soils have neutral reaction in the lower part of the fragipan. Thorndale soils either do not have rock fragments or they are dominated by schist.\nThe Andover, Armagh, Frenchtown, Mullins, Nolo, Purdy,\nShelmadine, Tyler, and Watchung series are in related families. Andover,Armagh, Mullins, Nolo, Purdy, Shelmadine, and Tyler soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Frenchtown soils average more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the textural control section.  Watchung soils average more than 35 percent clay in the textural control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brinkerton soils are nearly level to sloping soils on concave footslopes and around heads of drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils developed in medium textured colluvium from acid gray shale and siltstone.  The climate is humid and temperate, with mean annual precipitation of 35 to 50 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 56 degrees F., and the growing season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

Berks, Dekalb, and Hazleton soils do not have argillic horizons. Cavode and Wharton soils do not have fragipans. Gilpin and Rayne are well drained and do not have\nfragipans. Weikert soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches and do not have an argillic horizon.  The moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Comly, the moderately well drained Buchanan and the somewhat poorly drained Portville soils are in the same drainage sequence."

Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 21 inches (Btg horizon).\nc.  Fragipan - the zone from 21 to 42 inches (Btxg and Btx horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization sample S58PA32-3 was used as a basis for placing the Brinkerton series in the Fragiaqualfs great group.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
