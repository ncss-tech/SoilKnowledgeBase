  "OVERVIEW": "The Brinkerton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in medium textured colluvium derived from acid gray shale and siltstone. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the surface and upper subsoil, and moderately low or moderately high in the fragipan and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm, mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
