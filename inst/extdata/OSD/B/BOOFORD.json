  "OVERVIEW": "The Booford series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in andesitic volcanic ash and colluvium and residuum derived from tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rock.  Booford soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
