  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The sandy mantle is 10 to 20 inches thick. Most pedons have free carbonates in the 3BC horizon. Rock fragments content ranges from 0 to 2 percent by volume throughout the profile. They are mostly fine gravel. Material 3 in at least the upper part commonly contains 60 to 75 percent clay, but the range includes pedons with clay content minimally qualifying as contrasting.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon of forest litter as much as 2 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Dry value is 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam, but some pedons have thin subhorizons of sandy loam or coarse sandy loam in the upper part of the horizon. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nA 3Btg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay or silty clay. It has prominent to faint redox features. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 3BCg or 3Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is clay or silty clay, but some pedons have subhorizons of silty clay loam or clay loam. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bearville soils are on plane to slightly concave surfaces on the margins and deltas of lake plains and outwash terraces within lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in a sandy mantle of outwash or beach deposits and a layer of loamy sediments overlying clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 28 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1000 to 1600 feet."

The poorly drained Indus, somewhat poorly drained Alango and moderately well drained Taylor soils do not have a sandy mantle. Somewhat poorly drained Morcom and moderately well drained Thistledew soils are on higher positions. Somewhat poorly drained Meehan soils are on slightly higher positions and formed in very deep sandy sediments."

Perched saturation is at a depth of 0 to 1 foot at sometime during April through June and October through November in most years."
