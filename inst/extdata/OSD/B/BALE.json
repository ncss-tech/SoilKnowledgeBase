  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 to 63 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The soil between depths of 5 to 25 inches is usually dry from June until November 15 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.\nRock fragments make up about 10 to 25 percent of the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The fragments consist of rounded pebbles ranging in diameter from 2 mm to 1 inch and very few up to 3 inches.  Thin very gravelly horizons occur at depths of 26 to 40 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 18 to 28 percent clay.  Some pedons have a few mottles below a depth of 2 feet.  Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid with some pedons strongly acid.\nThe Ap horizon is dark gray to very dark grayish brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and has value of 3, 5 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Texture is loam, or clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate crumb, subangular blocky or is massive.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard but is not massive and hard when dry.\nThe B2 horizon is dark gray and dark grayish brown to brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue with value of 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1, 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is loam, heavy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  There is a slight clay increase with some thin clay films but not enough to qualify for an argillic horizon.  This horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe horizons below the B2 horizon are buried A horizons or highly stratified C horizons.  They are light gray to dark grayish brown in 10YR hue with value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Rock fragments, as described above, make up less than 50 percent of the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cole, Pacheco, Pajaro, and Soquel series.  Cole soils have a fine particle-size class, an argillic horizon, and have more than 75 percent base saturation.  Pacheco soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within depth of 30 inches.  Pajaro soils have an aquic moisture regime, have mesic temperature, and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Soquel soils have a regular decrease in organic matter, more than 75 percent base saturation throughout and have mesic temperature."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bale soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans and terraces at elevations of 100 to 300 feet.  They formed in stratified, gravelly and sandy alluvium from mixed sources. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 32 to 40 inches.  Average January temperature is 46 degrees F; average July temperature is 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 59 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 220 to 270 days."
