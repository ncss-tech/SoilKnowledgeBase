These soils formed in residuum weathered from the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite (welded tuff).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring from July through September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 210 to 260 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

Decoty soils have a calcic horizon and are similar positions. Ohtwo soils are deep soils that are on lower steep to very steep colluvial scarps below the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite. They are on lower hills and scarps. Sauceda soils are very shallow and shallow to Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite and are on more sloping areas near incised drainageways. Reduff soils are very shallow and shallow to tuffaceous bedrock of the Duff and Pruett Formations."

This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals in the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite, and from laboratory data from similar soils from Presidio County, Texas.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nUpdate and revisions for Recorrelation of Brewster County, TX, Main Part, 2/7/08, CEM.\nRevised for the correlation of Presidio County, Texas ; Oct, 2012, WWJ\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
