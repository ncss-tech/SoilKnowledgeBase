  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackpipe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey residuum from shale and mudstone on uplands.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 12 to 25 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches with streaks and tongues extending into the underlying horizon of some pedons.  The CEC/clay ratio ranges from .60 to 1.0 in the A and Bt horizon and from .60 to as much as 2.0 below.  Soft, but brittle, siltstone or shales are between depths of 20 and 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is a silt loam or silty clay loam, but is clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, clay loam, silty clay or clay averaging between 35 to 50 percent clay and contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have few to many very fine particles of siltstone or shale which do not soften when wet.  The Bk horizon contains 5 to about 20 percent accumulations of carbonate and it is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color and texture of the Bk horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is shale, mudstone, or siltstone.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Ashford and Thunderbird soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.   Leyden soils contain more coarse fragments.  Boneek, Collbran, Kube, Nuncho, Nunn, Rednun, Richfield, Ryus, Savo, Sofia, Showlow, Standley, Torreon, and Wormser do not have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  In addition, Boneek, Collbran, and Rednun have hue of 7.5YR or redder; Kube soils have higher CEC/clay ratios; Nunn, Rednun, and Wormser soils contain more fine sand or coarser; Ryus soils have carbonates at or near the surface; Sofia soils contain more clay; and Torreon soils formed in sediments influenced by basalt. Chapin soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Boquillas soils contain more coarse fragments and have redder hue in the argillic horizon.  Leyden soils contain more coarse fragments.  Emigrant, Leyden, and Querc soils contain more fine sand or coarser.  Huggins soils have higher CEC/clay ratios.  Loma soils have hue of 5YR or redder and contain free carbonates throughout."

Norrest soils are on the adjacent high convex landscapes.  Savo soils are on concave surfaces and are typically below the Blackpipe soils in the landscape.  Cedar Butte soils have a natric horizon and are in slightly depressed to concave positions below the Blackpipe soils. Midway and Imlay soils are on steeper slopes and do not have a mollic epipedon and have bedrock within depths of 12 to 20 inches.  Okreek soils are on broad flats and have more than 60 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
