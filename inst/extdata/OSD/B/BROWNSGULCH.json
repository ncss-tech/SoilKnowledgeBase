  "OVERVIEW": "The Brownsgulch series are very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 406 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
