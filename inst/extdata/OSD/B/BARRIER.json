  "OVERVIEW": "The Barrier series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Barrier soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
