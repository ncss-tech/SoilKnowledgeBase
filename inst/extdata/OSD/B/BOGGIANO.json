The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 63 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section between depths of 5 and 20 inches is dry in all parts from June to October unless irrigated, and moist in all parts from December to April.  Fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Organic matter decreases regularly with depth and is greater than 1 percent at 20 inches. Secondary lime occurs within 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.

Elevations are 40 to 170 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs in the winter months.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 77 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 260 to 280 days."
