  "OVERVIEW": "The Beanlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till or alluvium.  These soils are on moraines, till plains, alluvial fans, stream terraces and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
