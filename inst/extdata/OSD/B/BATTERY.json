Elevations are 17 to 280 meters (55 to 915 feet). These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2290 millimeters (50 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).

Catchings soils have more than 35 percent rock fragment in their particle size control section. Coppercreek soils have subangular fragments throughout. Tarquin has redoximorphic features below 75 centimeters.  The Catchings soils are found are linear to strongly convex slope positions alongside the Battery soils on very gravelly alluvium. Coppercreek soils are found above Battery soils on schist, sandstone, and mudstone. Tarquin soils are found in concave slope positions below the Battery soils. Where this soil is in the southern part of its range, it occurs with Scoutcamp and Redwoodhouse. Scoutcamp soils have less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand in the particle size control section and occur on mountain slopes on siltstone. Redwoodhouse soils have greater than 35 percent base saturation by sum of cations in the lower part of the profile and occur on mountain slopes on sandstone and mudstone."
