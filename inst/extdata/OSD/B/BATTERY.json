Coppercreek soils are found above Battery soils on schist, sandstone, and mudstone. Tarquin soils are found in concave slope positions below the Battery soils. Where this soil is in the southern part of its range, it occurs with Scoutcamp and Redwoodhouse. Scoutcamp soils have less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand in the particle size control section and occur on mountain slopes on siltstone. Redwoodhouse soils have greater than 35 percent base saturation by sum of cations in the lower part of the profile and occur on mountain slopes on sandstone and mudstone."
