  "OVERVIEW": "The Berthahill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from quartzite with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountain slopes, summits, and ridges.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
