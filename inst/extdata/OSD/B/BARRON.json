Arrastre and Bestrom soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Cassolary soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days, have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 53 degrees F and are moderately well drained.  Clayton soils have a solum 10 to 20 inches thick and have a E and Bs horizon.  Frailey soils are dry 60 to 80 consecutive days, have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F and have loam texture throughout the profile.  Green Bluff soils are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days, have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F and are silt loam and loam textured throughout.  Hudnut soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F, have a solum 15 to 32 inches thick and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Kartar soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F and typically have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.  Koerling soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F and have calcareous lake sediments at 24 to 40 inches.  Koseth soils are neutral to moderately alkaline, have 15 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles in the particle-size control section, are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days and have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 50 degrees F.  Quinden soils have a solum over 60 inches thick, have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR throughout and are loam or gravelly loam textured throughout.  Scala soils are dry 60 to 90 consecutive days and have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F.  Stoner soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.
