These soils formed in  alluvium and some colluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influenceand cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2550 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 280 to 300 days."
