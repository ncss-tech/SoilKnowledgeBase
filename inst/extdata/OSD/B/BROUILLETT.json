    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brouillett soils are on flood plains commonly adjacent to the stream channel. They are on plane or convex slopes with gradient of less than 2 percent. They formed in dark-colored loamy alluvium primarily in areas of late Wisconsin glaciation. Some pedons contain up to 51 cm (20 inches) of lighter colored overwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10.0 to 1.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). and mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches0. Frost free period ranges from 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 122 to 274 meters (400 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."

The apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) from January to May at sometime in most years. This soil is frequently or occasionally flooded for brief periods."
