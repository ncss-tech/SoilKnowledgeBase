    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Solum depth ranges from 13 to 19 inches.  The control section contains greater than 40 percent carbonates by weight.  Rock fragments are dominantly limestone.  The surface horizon has 0 to 10 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones.  The B and C horizons have 25 to 45 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent stones and cobbles.  Total rock fragment ranges from 35 to 50 percent in the Bw and C horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 1.\nSome pedons have an A horizon below the muck surface layer with hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is 2 to 4 inches thick and has textures similar to the Bw and Cd horizon. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw and Cd horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures are very gravelly analogs of fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam. Reaction of the Bw and Cd horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Shelter soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on higher landscape positions."
