  "OVERVIEW": "The Beavertail series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on ground moraines, and glacial lake benches.  They are shallow or moderately deep to dense till. Beavertail soils formed in loamy glacial till.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Rock fragments are dominantly limestone.  The surface horizon has 0 to 10 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones.  The B and C horizons have 25 to 45 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent stones and cobbles.  Total rock fragment ranges from 35 to 50 percent in the Bw and C horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 1.\nSome pedons have an A horizon below the muck surface layer with hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is 2 to 4 inches thick and has textures similar to the Bw and Cd horizon. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw and Cd horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures are very gravelly analogs of fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam. Reaction of the Bw and Cd horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
