  "OVERVIEW": "The Boyd series consists of moderately deep, well drained, soils formed in residuum weathered from clay shale on uplands.  Permeability is slow or very slow.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 18 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches and extends into the Bw horizon.  Cracks 1/2-inch to 1-inch wide and several feet long commonly extend through the solum when dry.  Tongues of the A horizon material are common in the Bw, Bss and BCss horizons, and some extend into the C horizon.  The soil has an EC of 2 mmhos/cm or less throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw and Bss horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silty clay or clay and averages from 45 to 60 percent clay.  They range from neutral to moderately alkaline and have few fine accumulations of carbonate in the lower part.\nThe BCss horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6 dry or moist; and chroma of 3.  It is silty clay or clay and averages from 45 to 60 percent clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Bk or By horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 4 to 6 and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons contain few to many nests of gypsum and other salts.  It contains 5 to 50 percent shale fragments.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 (dry or moist), and chroma of 1 to 3.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons contain few to common nests of gypsum and other salts in the upper part."

Boro, Lakoma, Millboro, Promise and Reliance soils are on similar landscapes.  Boro soils lack a mollic epipedon and have shale at greater depths.  Lakoma soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Millboro soils have argillic horizons and have shale at depths below 40 inches.  Promise soils are very fine textured and are deeper to shale.  Reliance soils have an argillic horizon and contain less clay.  Sansarc soils are on steep nearby landscapes, lack a mollic epipedon, and have shale within depths of 20 inches.  Witten soils are in swales and have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick and have argillic horizons."
