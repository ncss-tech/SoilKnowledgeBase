  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellehelen series consists of shallow or very shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Bellehelen soils are on hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
