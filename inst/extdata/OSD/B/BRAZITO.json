Birdcanyon, Bluepoint, Cajon, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Pintura, Moapa and Toquop soils are in the Mohave Desert and are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Yturbide soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Copia soils have hues of 2.5YR, 5YR and 7.5YR and chromas of 6 to 8.  Artir, Boxjoe, Butterbredt, Kajoe, and University soils are inactive.  Morongo and Yander soils do not have a description (OSD) and cannot be competed."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Brazito soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans, dunes, and low terraces of major streams.  Slopes are generally less than 5 percent.  The soil formed in sandy alluvium many feet thick derived from rhyolite, andesite, monzonite, granite, quartzite, basalt, sandstone and limestone.  The climate is semiarid to arid continental.  The mean annual air temperature is 58 to 70 degrees F; and the mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Much of the precipitation falls during summer in heavy thunderstorms of short duration.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 5,300 feet.  The frost-free period is 220 to 280 days."
