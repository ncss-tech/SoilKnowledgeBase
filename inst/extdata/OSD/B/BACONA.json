  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 18 to 25 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent 2 to 5 millimeter concretions.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 dry and moist.  It dominantly is silt loam but the lower part is silty clay loam in some pedons.  It averages 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and 4 to 8 dry.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay and up to 5 percent 2 to 5 millimeter concretions.  It is strongly acid or medium acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bacona soils are on mountains at elevations of 400 to 1,600 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in eolian material mixed with colluvium weathered from sedimentary bedrock.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  Mean July temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F; mean January temperature is 35 to 37 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 75 inches.  The frost-free season is 100 to 180 days."

Kenusky soils are poorly drained and have a clayey argillic horizon.  Mayger soils are somewhat poorly drained and fine textured."
