Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 1 to 8 percent clay and 65 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral thoughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly or very gravelly ashy fine sandy loam.  It has 25 to 40 percent pebbles and 10 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.
