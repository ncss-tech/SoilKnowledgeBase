  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Benklin series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slow permeable soils.  These soils are typically on the first terrace level of streams.  They formed in loamy alluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The control section has 18 to 32 percent clay and 20 to 40 percent sand with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3), or very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam or silt loam. Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon is very dark brown or very dark grayish brown loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. It contains few to many, faint or distinct mottles of dark grayish brown, grayish brown, brown, yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown, or strong brown.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt4 horizon is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It is typically mottled in shades of brown, yellow or red.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a few pitted concretions of carbonate below a depth of 45 inches."

Armistead soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder below the mollic epipedon.  Bonham soils have a clayey control section.   Reelfoot soils have a mollic epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and have sola as thin as 30 inches.  Waskom soils have a fine-loamy control section."
