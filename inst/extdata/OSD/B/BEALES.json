Laboratory data determined that Beales exceeded the base saturated criteria for that classification.\nPartial reference samples from pedon 85P0882, samples 85P04712-4721 from Kantishna Area, samples by SSL, Lincoln, NE, August 01, 1985; and  and 07N0022, samples 07N00101-0103 samples by SSL, Lincoln, NE, July 12, 2006\nThe Beales series formerly classified as a Typic Cryopsamment and included soils without a cambic horizon.  These non cambic soils are now correlated to the Teklanika series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
