  "OVERVIEW": "The Breckenridge series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits overlying loamy till on lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
