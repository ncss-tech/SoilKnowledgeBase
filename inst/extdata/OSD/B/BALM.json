Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or gravelly loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe AC horizon has value of 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and 1 to 3 dry. It has common to many fine to coarse redox concentrations.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon is very gravelly sand or loamy sand.  It has 35 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent.  Soil reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline."
