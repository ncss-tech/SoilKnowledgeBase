The soil has aquic conditions present between depths of 12 and 24 inches with chromas of 2 or less and accompanying redox concentrations.  The soil is calcareous down to the fluctuating ground water table.  Depth to the contrasting 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or gravelly loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe AC horizon has value of 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and 1 to 3 dry. It has common to many fine to coarse redox concentrations.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon is very gravelly sand or loamy sand.  It has 35 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent.  Soil reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline."
