    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 70 to 90 days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the argillic horizon is 2 to 10 inches.  There is an absolute increase in clay between the A and the 2Bt horizons of 15 percent or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 5 to 10 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2Btk horizon, when present, has value of 5 to 7 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, coarse sandy loam, or loamy coarse sand with 5 to 25 percent clay.  It has 10 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alibi, Coleman, Dry Creek, Lasere, Pomponio (T), Pritchard, Succor, and Tutuilla series.  Alibi soils are moderately deep to rhyolite bedrock and lack secondary carbonates.  Coleman soils are moderately well drained and lack secondary carbonates.  Dry Creek soils have an argillic horizon that is moderately acid to neutral in its reaction and have a calcium carbonate equivalent that exceeds 15 percent.  Lasere soils are moderately deep to basalt or tuff and are slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Pritchard soils have an argillic horizon at a depth of 10 to 20 inches and its profile only displays minimal evidence of secondary carbonates.  Succor soils have a Bq horizon.  Pomponio soils are moderately deep to shale.  Tutuilla soils are deep to sedimentary rock and lack secondary carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belshaw soils are on rolling hills and south slopes.  They formed in colluvium derived from tuffaceous sediments with an influence of ash and loess in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevation is 2,200 to 4,600 feet.  At higher elevations, these soils are only on south-facing slopes.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."

Kishwalk, Tanksel, and Waterbury soils are found on basaltic hillsides above tuffaceous sediments and are clayey-skeletal.  Also, Kishwalk soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock whereas Waterbury soils are shallow to basalt.  Tanksel soils are on north slopes, have ash in the surface horizons, and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Tub soils are also formed in tuffaceous sediments, but Tub soils are on alluvial fans and north slopes, are pachic, and lack the abrupt textural change."
