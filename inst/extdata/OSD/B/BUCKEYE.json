    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, but is dry throughout the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer.  Mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to hard bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe B horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam averaging 25 to 35 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Some high chroma mottles are in the lower part of this horizon in some pedons.  Clay films are faint to distinct."

The soils formed in material weathered from metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and dry warm summers.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 220 days."
