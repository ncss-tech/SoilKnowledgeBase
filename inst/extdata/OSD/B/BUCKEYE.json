  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckeye series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from weathered greenstone.  Buckeye soils are on low rolling footslopes and mountainsides.  Slopes range frome 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to hard bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe B horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam averaging 25 to 35 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Some high chroma mottles are in the lower part of this horizon in some pedons.  Clay films are faint to distinct."
