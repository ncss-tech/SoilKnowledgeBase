  "OVERVIEW": "The Bucan series consist of deep, well drained soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over residuum derived from volcanic rocks and tuff.  The Bucan soils are on hill and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
