These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from extrusive volcanic rocks and tuff.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
