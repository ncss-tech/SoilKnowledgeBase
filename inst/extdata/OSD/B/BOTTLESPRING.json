  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bottlespring series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils in volcanic fields mantling lava flows.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice derived from dacite over residuum weathered from volcanic rock or tephra.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
