  "OVERVIEW": "The Badgercamp series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from soft tuffaceous bedrock.  Badgercamp soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

They formed in residuum derived from soft tuffaceous bedrock.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,400 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 5 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
