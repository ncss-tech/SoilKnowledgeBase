Hiridge soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 8 degrees C, and are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative during summer months due to convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Badgercamp soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum derived from soft tuffaceous bedrock.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,400 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 5 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
