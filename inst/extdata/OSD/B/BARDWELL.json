  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is commonly 40 to 60 inches but ranges to 70 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is commonly 10 to 17 inches but ranges to 24 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is dominantly silt loam, but the range includes silty clay loam and loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2, or value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Ped coatings commonly have value of 3, but ranges from 2 through 4.  The Bw horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Clay content averages from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe BC horizon, and the CB and C horizons when present, have colors similar to those of the Bw horizon.  These horizons commonly contain more sand than the Bw horizon and are stratified.  Textures of the BC horizon include silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sand, loamy fine sand, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, and the gravelly or cobbly analogues."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Radley soils are the only competing member in this family.  The Radley soils are in a drier climate.  They have a moist subhumid to humid climate with a Thornwaite annual P-E index of 64 to 82.  Other competing soils is the Lynnville soils, which have mottles with chroma less than 2 and value of 4 or more within 6 inches below the mollic epipedon.  The Huntington soils are in a similar family with a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bardwell soils are on broad, level to undulating flood plains of the lower Ohio River and upper Mississippi River.  The slope range is dominantly 0 to 3 percent.  Slopes ranging up to 25 percent are commonly adjacent to the river banks.  The Bardwell soils formed in recent alluvium washed from the watersheds of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.  The mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 52 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowdre, Crevasse, Commerce, Keyespoint, Mhoon, Openlake, and Robinsonville soils.  Bowdre and Keyespoint soils are clayey over loamy are on flood plains.  Commerce, Mhoon, and Openlake soils are somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils on lower lying areas, swales, and depressions in the flood plains.  Crevasse and Robinsonville soils are more sandy throughout and are on the higher natural leaves near the river banks."
