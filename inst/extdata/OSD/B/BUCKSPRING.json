  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckspring series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone. Buckspring soils are on back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
