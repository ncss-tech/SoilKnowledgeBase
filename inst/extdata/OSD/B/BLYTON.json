Reaction is moderately acid to neutral, depending on liming history.\nThe C horizon, to a depth of at least 40 inches (120 cm), has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Iron depletions are in the lower part. Texture is silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C or Cg horizon, below a depth of 40 inches (102 cm), has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam or loam and may have thin strata of fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Clay content ranges from 10 to 26 percent and sand content ranges from 5 to 45 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.) and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 46 inches (889 to 1168 mm). Frost free days range from 150 to 210 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 540 feet (130 to 165 meters) above mean sea level."
