  "OVERVIEW": "The Bursteadt series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
