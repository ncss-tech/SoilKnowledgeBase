Bock soils are on terraces, are well drained and are not pachic.  Cowbone soils are on valley flats and are poorly drained.  Dawtonia soils are on mountains and fan terraces, are well drained and have argillic horizons.  Sprabat soils are on fan terraces, are well drained and lack mollic epipedons.  Tohobit soils are on valley flats, are moderately well drained and have sandy skeletal particle-size control sections."
