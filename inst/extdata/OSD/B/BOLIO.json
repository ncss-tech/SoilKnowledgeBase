  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: A layer of Sphagnum moss less than 12 inches thick occurs at the surface of the peat in some pedons. Depth to permafrost ranges from 6 inches to more than 40 inches, depending on the density of vegetation and thickness of the surface mat of undecomposed peat. A silty or sandy mineral substratum often occurs at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nenana, Tanana, Toklat, and Volkmar soils. Nenana soils occupy adjoining uplands, and have a brown cambic horizon and a sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum without permafrost. Tanana soils occupy low terraces and high bottoms, and have a thin organic horizon over silty gleyed soils with permafrost. Toklat soils are slightly higher than the Bolio soils, and have a thick albic horizon over a cemented spodic horizon. Volkmar soils are in swales in uplands and have a thin organic horizon over mottled silty loam and a sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum."

The expanded control section now in use captures the increase in pH with depth and the series now classifies as euic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
