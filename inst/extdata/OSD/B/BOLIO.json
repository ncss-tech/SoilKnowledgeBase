  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. SR-JPM",
  "REVDATE": "09/2007",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bolio series consists of very poorly drained, partially decomposed organic soils derived mostly from sedges in depressions in uplands and terraces. Bolio soils are perennially frozen at some depth. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: A layer of Sphagnum moss less than 12 inches thick occurs at the surface of the peat in some pedons. Depth to permafrost ranges from 6 inches to more than 40 inches, depending on the density of vegetation and thickness of the surface mat of undecomposed peat. A silty or sandy mineral substratum often occurs at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bolio soils are in slight depressions or naturally drained lake basins in uplands and terraces. They are nearly level. The mean annual temperature ranges from 24 degrees to 30 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nenana, Tanana, Toklat, and Volkmar soils. Nenana soils occupy adjoining uplands, and have a brown cambic horizon and a sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum without permafrost. Tanana soils occupy low terraces and high bottoms, and have a thin organic horizon over silty gleyed soils with permafrost. Toklat soils are slightly higher than the Bolio soils, and have a thick albic horizon over a cemented spodic horizon. Volkmar soils are in swales in uplands and have a thin organic horizon over mottled silty loam and a sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum."

The expanded control section now in use captures the increase in pH with depth and the series now classifies as euic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
