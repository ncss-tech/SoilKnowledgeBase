  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to the dense substratum ranges from 20 to 38 inches.  Depth to bedrock is commonly more than six feet.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the surface layer, 0 to 20 percent in the subsoil and from 5 to 35 percent in the substratum.  Except where the surface layer is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded pebbles and typically make up 65 percent or more of the total rock fragments. Unless limed, the soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid, but some horizon between 10 and 40 inches is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR value 3 or 4 and chroma 2 to 4.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon that has hue 10YR, value 2 or 3 and chroma 1 or 2.  The Ap or A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the fine earth.  It has weak granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon below the A horizon.  It has hue 10YR or 2.5Y value 4 through 6 and chroma 1 to 3.  Texture, structure and consistence are like the A horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value and chroma 4 to 6.  Some pedons have a thin lower B horizon with 5YR hue. The lower part of the B horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features above a depth of 24 inches.  The B horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand in the fine earth.  It has weak, fine or medium granular structure or it is massive or single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe 2Cd horizon is neutral or has hue 2.5YR to 5Y, value 2 to 5 and chroma 1 to 4, and commonly has redoximorphic features.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth.  The horizon has weak or moderate, thin to thick plates or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Theses are the Algansee, Altmar, Brems, Brockatonorton, Deerfield, Elnora, Fortress, Livonia, Meckling, Morocco, Ottokee, Partridge, Tedrow, and Zaborosky series.\nAlgansee, Brems, Brockatonorton, Livonia, Morocco, Ottokee, Partridge, Tedrow, and Zaborosky soils are from outside LRR R.\nAlgansee soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Altmar and Livonia soils do not have a densic contact within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface. Brems and Ottokee soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick. Brockatonorton soils have a buried histic epipedon. Elnora soils contain less medium and coarse sand in the lower part of the control section and lack angular rock fragments.  Morocco and Partridge and Zaborosky soils have iron depletions above 15 inches. Tedrow and Zaborosky soils are calcareous within the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Birchwood soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on till plains that typically border outwash terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent but commonly is less than 8 percent.  The soils formed in sandy sediments over loamy till.  The till is derived from a wide variety of rocks, including sandstone, shale, phyllite, schist, gneiss, and granite. Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches and the growing season is 120 to 185 days."

Agawam, Hartford, Hinckley, Manchester, Merrimac, Penwood, Quonset and Windsor soils are better drained soils on nearby terraces.  Bernardston, Broadbrook, Narragansett, Newport, Paxton, Pittstown, Rainbow, Wapping and Wethersfield soils are loamy soils on nearby uplands. Deerfield, Ellington, Ninigret, and Sudbury soils have a stratified sandy or sandy and gravelly substratum within a depth of 40 inches. Essex soils are better drained upland soils with a loamy sand substratum.\nHinesburg soils lack redoximorphic features in the B horizon and are underlain by stratified and varved loamy lacustrine materials. Ludlow and Woodbridge soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Pompton, Sutton, and Watchaug soils are coarse-loamy and lack a dense substratum. Poquonock soils (well drained) are associated in a drainage sequence. Scituate soils have a loamy solum."

Some areas are used for community development.  A few areas are idle or used as woodland.  Common trees are red, white and black oak, red maple, white ash, gray birch, and white pine."
