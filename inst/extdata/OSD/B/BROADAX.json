  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broadax soils are on hillslopes and plateaus at elevations of 800 to 3,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in old loess mixed with recent loess in the upper part. Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is dominantly 15 to 18 inches: the low precipitation phase ranges to 12 to 16 inches; some areas in eastern Washington and Idaho range to 20 inches. The average July temperature is 69 degrees F. and the average January temperature is 27 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 105 to 170 days."

Anders soils lack an argillic horizon and are moderately deep to basalt bedrock (lithic contact). Benge soils lack an argillic horizon and are sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Bagdad soils are coarse-silty. Calouse soils lack an argillic horizon and have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick. Dragoon soils are underlain by a paralithic contact with granite at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Reardan soils are in a fine family."
