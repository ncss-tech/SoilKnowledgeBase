The soils formed in mixed alluvium or lacustrine sediments. Loess has been deposited in some areas. The semiarid or arid climate has a frost-free period of 100 to 160 days. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches, including light snowfall and dry summers. Average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F."

Buko and Paniogue soils are sandy or sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the control sections. Garbutt soils are well drained and lack B horizons. Letha soils have a moderately coarse textured control section. Mellor soils have natric horizons. Palisade and Thiokol soils have coarse-loamy and fine-silty control sections respectively. Palisade, Paniogue and Thiokol soils are on higher terraces. Mellor soils are on similar landscape positions."
