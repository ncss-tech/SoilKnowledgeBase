  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckloaf series consists of moderately-deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. These soils are on hills, mesas and pediments. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
