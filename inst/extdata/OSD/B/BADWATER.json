  "OVERVIEW": "The Badwater series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in bouldery colluvium. They are on valley sides below quartzitic sandstone escarpments.  Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A and BA horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Commonly, a boulder or parts of boulders occupy 15 to 35 percent of the horizon.\nThe Bt1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  A boulder or boulders occupy 35 to 60 percent of the horizon.\nThe Bt2 horizon has value of 4 to 5 dry, 3 to 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam or loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Boulders occupy 60 to 90 percent of this horizon.\nCommonly, boulders occupy more than 85 percent of the C horizon."

Bickmore, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Panin, and Woodhurst soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and have smaller rock fragments.  Geemore soils have a Bkq horizon. Kiote soils have 45 to 60 percent pebbles in the Bt horizon.  Redbird soils have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation. Parkay, Tusel, and Woodcock soils have mainly pebbles and cobbles."
