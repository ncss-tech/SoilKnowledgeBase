  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 34 to 52 inches.  Depth to sand or stratified sand and gravel is more than 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Rock fragments of sandstone gravel  and occasionally of shale, range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon and upper part of the Bw horizon, from 0 to 30 percent in the lower part of the Bw horizon and in the C horizon above 40 inches, and from 5 to 80 percent in the C horizon below 40 inches.  Reaction throughout the soil ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Fine-earth textures are loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Fine-earth textures are sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam.  Textures of sand and sandy loam are restricted to the C horizon below 40 inches. The C horizon below 40 inches may also be stratified with gravel."

The soils formed in recent alluvial deposits derived from upland soil materials weathered from red and brown shale, sandstone, and conglomerate.  Climate is humid and temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.; and the growing season ranges from 135 to 200 days."

Bowmansville soils are poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained.  Abbottstown, Croton, Lamington, Raritan and Readington soils have fragipans.  Birdsboro, Bucks, Lansdale, Penn and Reaville soils have argillic horizons.  Klinesville soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface."
