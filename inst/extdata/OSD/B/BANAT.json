  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 13 to 30 inches.  Reaction of the solum ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline.  Volume of pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E, and Bt1 horizons and from 25 to 80 percent in the 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2C horizons.  Volume of coarse fragments over 3 inches range from 0 to 5 percent in the A, E, and Bt1 horizons and from 0 to 10 percent in the 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or mucky analogues of these textures.  Some areas have an Ap horizon.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E/B horizon has characteristics similar to the E and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly analogues of these textures.  The 2Bt horizon has similar hue, value, and chroma, but has textures that are very gravelly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  The 2Bt3 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand or very gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly sand, coarse sand, or sand."
