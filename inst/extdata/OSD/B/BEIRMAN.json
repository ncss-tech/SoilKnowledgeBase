The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The texture is clay throughout with a weighted average of 60 to 70 percent clay within the texture control section.  Depth to weathered sediments is 40 to over 60 inches.  Depth to secondary lime ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has chromas of 2, 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe AC1 horizon has values of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chromas of 2 to 4 dry and moist.\nThe AC2 horizon has values of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  The AC2 horizon has churned material as streaks and surfaces of peds of 10YR hue, values of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chromas of 6 or 8 moist and dry.\nThe C horizons have 5Y to 10YR hues, values of 5 to 8 dry and moist, and chromas of 2 to 6 moist and dry."
