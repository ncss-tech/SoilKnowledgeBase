    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beclabito soils are on toeslopes between cuestas and on footslopes and alluvial cones of escarpments. They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Jurassic and Cretaceous sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,900 to 6,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches about half of which falls as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The remainder falls as gentle rain or snow between December and mid-April. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

McElmo soils are fine textured, have gypsic horizons and are on adjacent dipslopes of cuestas. Snapill soils are fine-silty and have argillic horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 4 inches. (A horizon)\nNatric horizon - The zone from 4 to about 36 inches. (Btk, Btkn1, and Btkn2 horizons)\nHaplic subgroup - SAR of less than 13 in most of the natric horizon, but greater than 13 within 16 inches of the upper boundary (lower Btkn1 horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 14 to about 56 inches. (Btkn1, Btkn2, 2Bkn and 2BCkn horizons)\nLithic contact - The presence of hard sandstone bedrock at about 56 inches.\nAt the type location in the Shiprock Area the mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, but in the Ute Mountain Area the precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Salinity values were determined with a Wheatstone bridge and Instant EC Salinity kit. Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter. One pedon sampled for BIA soils lab in Gallup, New Mexico as sample S88NM-045-1. Lab results confirm the Haplic subgroup placement.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
