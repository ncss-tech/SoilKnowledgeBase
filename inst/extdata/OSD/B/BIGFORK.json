  "REVDATE": "03/2021",
  "STATES": "AR,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigfork series consists of moderately deep to hard chert, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from chert or novaculite that is tilted 35 degrees from horizontal of Ordovician age. These gently sloping to very steep soils are on ridges of uplands in the Ouachita Mountains land resource area. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (62 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is 1219 mm (48 in).",
