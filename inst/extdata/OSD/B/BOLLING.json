  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments of mostly gravel make up 0 to 15 percent of the soil.  The soil commonly ranges from very strongly acid through neutral in the A horizon and in the upper part of the B horizon and from moderately acid through moderately alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon.  Few to common flakes of mica and/or opaque minerals are throughout the solum in most pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The E horizon is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  High and low chroma mottles range from common to many.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Thin layers of loamy material are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Mottles range from few to many.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Thin layers of loamy material are in the lower part of the Btg horizon in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Some pedons have a matrix color with chroma of 2 or less.  It is loamy sand through clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, is variable in color.  It is stratified and ranges from loamy sand through clay.  Some pedons have gravel and cobbles."

Abell, Altavista, Augusta, Charleston, Dogue, Forestdale, Fork, Pamunkey, State, Tetotum, and Wickham series are in closely related families.  Abell, Altavista, Augusta, Dogue, State, Tetotum, and Wickham soils have base saturation less than 35 percent.  Charleston soils are in a coarse-loamy family.  Forestdale and Fork soils are more poorly drained.  Pamunkey soils are well drained."
