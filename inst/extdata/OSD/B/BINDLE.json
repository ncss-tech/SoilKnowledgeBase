  "OVERVIEW": "The Bindle series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed ash, loess and colluvium over fractured andesite or basalt.  Bindle soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all subhorizons between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Depth to highly fractured bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The solum is estimated to have a volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 20 to 35 percent fine gravel and/or concretions 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe AB and Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is gravelly or cobbly ashy clay loam and has 20 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent stones and averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe 2R layer ranges from highly fractured bedrock with no displacement and little fines in the fractures to bedrock with cracks more than 12 inches apart."

The soils formed in colluvium composed of volcanic ash mixed with loess and stony colluvium weathered from andesite or basalt overlying fractured andesite or basalt. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 30 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
