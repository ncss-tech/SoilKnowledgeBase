This does affect the behavior of the soil.  A proposal to recognize the fracturing has been suggested in the past.  Also, the type and amount of redoximorphic features in the dense till may be directly related to the fracturing.\nPreviously this soil was included with the Paddock soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nPedon S1995MN111001 is the typical pedon.\nLaboratory data--KSSL pedon 81MN153004 was sampled as a poorly drained Paddock and has been correlated to Becida series; pedon S1981MN153-004 (3511) has accompanying University of Minnesota lab data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
