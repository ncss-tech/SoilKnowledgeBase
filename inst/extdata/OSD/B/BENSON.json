  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 9 to 20 inches. The depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments make up 35 to 70 percent by volume of the particle size control section and range from 5 to 50 percent in the A horizon and from 15 to 70 percent in the Bw horizon. Channers are the dominant kind of rock fragment. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the A horizon, from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part of the Bw horizon, and is neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part of the Bw horizon. Carbonates are usually present in the lower part but can be found throughout the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth.\nSome pedons have a Cr or C horizon. It has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth. Rock fragments range from 20 to 90 percent.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nBedrock is limestone or calcareous shale."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There no series in the same family.\nThe Brimfield, Farmington, Galway, Hollis, Holyoke, Kearsarge, Lordstown,  Palatine, and Umpcoos series are similar soils in related families. The Umpcoos soil is more acid in the subsoil and is underlain by sandstone or siltstone. Brimfield, Hollis, Holyoke, and Kearsarge soils have less than 60 percent base saturation and less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. The Farmington soil has less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. The Galway soil has less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and the depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The Lordstown soil has less than 60 percent base saturation, less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and the depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The Palatine soil has a mollic epipedon and the depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benson soils are nearly level to very steep soils on glaciated uplands. They are on broad plains and on the tops and side slopes of hills, ridges, knolls, and mounds. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The soils formed in loamy till underlain by limestone or calcareous shale bedrock. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 56 degrees Farenheit. The frost free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

The Amenia and Massena soils have mottles in the subsoil. The Vergennes, Panton, and Covington soils formed in clayey lacustrine deposits and the depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision reflects new horizon designations and general updating.\nThis series was mapped in MLRA 146 (Maine) prior to the mesic/frigid separation and is still on the books. It would not be used there again.\nThe horizons and features diagnostic for the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon from 0 to 5 inches.\n2. Cambic horizon from 5 to 18 inches.\n3. Lithic contact at 18 inches.\n4. Carbonates in the cambic horizon or Cr horizon or the base saturation by Ammonium Acetate that is 60 percent or more in some subhorizon between 10 to 30 inches.\n5. Particle-size control section from 10 inches to the lithic contact is loamy-skeletal.\n6. Mesic soil temperature regime.\n7. Udic soil moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedons - S56VT-7-1 S56VT-7-2 (SSIR 20)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
