  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to weakly consolidated bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 15 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F. Coarse fragments, mainly angular shale or sandstone chips or semi-rounded gravel, range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the whole soil. These soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section from July 15, to September 30 in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam which may be modified with coarse fragments. Clay ranges from 27 to 35 percent. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk or Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. Textures may be modified with coarse fragments. Carbonates range from 5 to 15 percent. Reaction of the matrix is moderately alkaline, but ped interiors may be slightly alkaline.\nThe soil-bedrock interface is considered a paralithic contact. The weakly consolidated shale is interbedded with soft, fine grained sandstone. A large part of both sedimentary rocks slake with overnight shaking."

Burtoner, Clancy, Jeffcity, and Placerton, soils have a paralithic contact with decomposed granite (grus) that crushes to sandy material. Hoppers soils are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice. Absarook, Archmesa, Gurney, Maudlin, Moen Moento, Pianohill, and Watrous soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Reeder soils are usually dry for less than 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section from July 15 to September 30. Reedwest soils have a Bk horizon with a calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent."

The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches but ranges from 15 to 19 inches, of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June. The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 90 days."
