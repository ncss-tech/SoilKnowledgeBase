  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent above a depth of 40 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the solum and very strongly acid through slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry color value is 6 or more. It ranges from silt loam to sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium  granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It ranges from silt loam to sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky, prismatic, or granular. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It ranges from silt loam to sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is very weak or weak subangular blocky or platy, or the material is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. The material is massive, or has very weak to moderate platy structure.  Consistence ranges from very friable to firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Iotla, Philo, and Pootatuck series are in the same family. The Iotla soils have redoxomorphic concentrations in the upper part of the B horizon. They are somewhat poorly drained. The Philo soils have 7.5YR or yellower hue in the solum. Pootatuck have a 10YR or yellower hue in the solum and have a coarser substratum. The Bash series was a member of the same family, but has not been updated for CEC reaction class. The Bash soils have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the B horizon.\nThe Barbour, Comus, Linden, Middlebury, Northbend(T), Otego(T), Pope, and Teel series are similar soils in related families. Barbour and Northbend(T) soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size class. Comus, Linden, and Pope soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less above a depth of 24 inches. Middlebury and Teel soils have browner colors in the solum and greater than 60 percent base saturation above 30 inches. Otego(T) soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Basher soils are on flood plains and low terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from acid, reddish sandstone, siltstone and shale in both glaciated and residual areas. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45  degrees to 50 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 45  inches; and mean frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

Albrights, Calvin, Kedron, Lackawanna, Meckesville, Oquaga, and Wellsboro soils are on adjacent uplands. Birdsboro, Raritan, Tunkhannock, and Wyoming soils are on nearby terraces."
