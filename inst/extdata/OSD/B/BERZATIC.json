  "OVERVIEW": "The Berzatic series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, and calcareous shale.  Berzatic soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Some pedons include a high percent of flat, elongated shale fragments, but are always dominated by subrounded or angular fragments.\nStructure:  Subangular blocky or is massive.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates:  Present disseminated throughout the matrix, segregated as thin coats and as pendants on rock fragments."

Cadrina soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C.  Pintwater soils are heavily influenced by pyroclastic materials and have secondary silica and carbonate pendants on gravels, and have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Singatse soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Sojur and Tsaya soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 15 percent."
