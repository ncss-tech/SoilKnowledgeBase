    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blacktop, Cadrina, Pintwater, Singatse, Sojur, and Tsaya series.\nBlacktop soils are dominated by stones and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates.  Cadrina soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C.  Pintwater soils are heavily influenced by pyroclastic materials and have secondary silica and carbonate pendants on gravels, and have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Singatse soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Sojur and Tsaya soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 15 percent."

Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 1,830 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
