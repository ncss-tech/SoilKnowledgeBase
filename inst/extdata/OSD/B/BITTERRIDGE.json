  "OVERVIEW": "The Bitterridge series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and limestone. Bitterridge soils are on low hills. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
