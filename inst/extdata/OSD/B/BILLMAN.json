  "OVERVIEW": "The Billman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in interbedded shale and sandstone residuum.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
