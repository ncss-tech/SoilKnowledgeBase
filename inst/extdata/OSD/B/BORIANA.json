Baller soils contain sandstone rock fragments mostly of cobble and stone size and have hue yellower than 10YR. Demayo and Docdee soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Far soils have a typic ustic moisture regime. Faraway and Yaquican soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 52 degrees F.  Oro Grande soils have 8 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section.  Rotagilla soils are in an aridic ustic soil moisture regime and should be reclassified in an Aridic Lithic subgroup."
