  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boriana series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitic rock.  Boriana soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 10 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Baller soils contain sandstone rock fragments mostly of cobble and stone size and have hue yellower than 10YR. Demayo and Docdee soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Far soils have a typic ustic moisture regime. Faraway and Yaquican soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 52 degrees F.  Oro Grande soils have 8 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section.  Rotagilla soils are in an aridic ustic soil moisture regime and should be reclassified in an Aridic Lithic subgroup."
