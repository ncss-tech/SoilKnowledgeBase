  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barzee series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic materials.  These soils are in closed depressions on moraines, depressions or flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
