  "REVDATE": "03/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barbarela series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from gneiss, schist, or granite.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
