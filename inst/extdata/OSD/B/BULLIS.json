  "REVDATE": "04/2008",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bullis series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  These undulating soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from chert and shale.  They are on fans and footslopes below chert hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.",

The soils developed from alluvium and colluvium weathered primarily from chert of the Ouachita formation and, to a lesser extent, shale associated with this formation.  Mean annual precipitation range from 10 to 15 inches, mostly occurring July through September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 210 to 260 days and elevation ranges from 3,400 to 4,500 feet."

Catto soils are shallow to a lithic contact with chert and are on sideslopes and ridgetops above.  Coyanosa soils are shallow to a lithic contact with sandstone and are on adjacent sideslopes and ridgetops."
