    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum Thickness and depth to the Cca horizon range from 11 to 22 inches. Depth to shale ranges from 21 to 40 inches. Scattered sandstone slabs are throughout some pedons and a lag of quartzite and argillite gravel occurs on the surface in some pedons. Mean soil temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 59 degrees F. in the summer, 20 percent to 22 percent F. in the winter, and 29 degrees to 40 degrees F. annual temperature. The control section ranges from silty clay loam to loam and has 20 to 32 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand. Some pedons near the trees have thin 0 horizons or have a litter of needles.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 1 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has strong granular or crumb structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y and value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist. It has up to 5 percent more clay than the A horizon. This horizon has blocky or prismatic structure or has prismatic structure that separates to blocky.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silty clay loam or clay loam and has fragments of bedrock throughout most parts. They contain moderate amounts of segregated lime as threads and nodules. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation is 4,400 to 6,000 feet, and up to 8,000 feet in Wyoming. Strata of sandstone are exposed within the landscape. They formed in thin alluvial or outwash deposits over soft sedimentary beds. The climate is cold and semiarid. Mean summer temperature is 57 degrees to 59 degrees F., mean winter temperature is 21 degrees to 22 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 29 degrees to 40 degrees F. Precipitation ranges from 15 to 22 inches annually, most of which falls during spring and early summer. The (32 degrees F.) growing season is 50 to 70 days."

Adel soils occur within Bynum soils landscape on accumulation positions. They lack an argillic horizon and have a thick mollic epipedon. Doby and Fifer soils lack argillic horizons and are shallow over shale. Doby soils formed in clayey shales. Leavitt soils are deep, have argillic horizons and they occur on the benchlands above Bynum soils or intermingled on the slopes wherever the mantle of old outwash material is still present."
