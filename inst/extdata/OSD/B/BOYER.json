  "OVERVIEW": "The Boyer series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy drift underlain by sand or gravelly sand outwash at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). The soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, kames, beach ridges, river terraces, lake terraces, deltas, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

The slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 12 percent, but range from 0 to 50 percent. Boyer soils formed in sandy and loamy drift underlain by sand or gravelly sand outwash at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Quartz is the dominant mineral in the 3C horizon, which contains, in addition, varying amounts of material from igneous and metamorphic rocks, limestone, and dolomite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F)."
