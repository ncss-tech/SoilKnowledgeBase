  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Boyer soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, kames, beach ridges, river terraces, lake terraces, deltas, and moraines of Wisconsinan age. The slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 12 percent, but range from 0 to 50 percent. Boyer soils formed in sandy and loamy drift underlain by sand or gravelly sand outwash at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Quartz is the dominant mineral in the 3C horizon, which contains, in addition, varying amounts of material from igneous and metamorphic rocks, limestone, and dolomite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F)."

Boyer soils are the well drained member of drainage sequence that includes the moderately well drained Perrin, poorly drained Gilford, and somewhat poorly drained Wasepi soils. Spinks and Oshtemo soils are closely associated on the outwash plains and valley trains. Miami, Lapeer, and Hillsdale soils on adjoining moraines."

Potential surface runoff is negligible to medium depending upon slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and very rapid in the substratum."
