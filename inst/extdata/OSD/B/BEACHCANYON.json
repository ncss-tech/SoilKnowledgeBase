  "OVERVIEW": "The Beachcanyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or landslide deposits. These soils are on mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 10 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
