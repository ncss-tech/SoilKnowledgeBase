Rounded gravel and cobbles of sandstone, chert, and quartzite range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon, and 0 to 35 percent in the B horizon and 5 to 50 percent in the C horizon. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the A horizon and strongly acid through slightly acid in the B and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Botetourt soils are on second bottoms and low stream terraces along major streams and rivers subject to none to rare flooding. Slope gradients are most commonly 2 to 7 percent slopes, but range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in alluvial materials from limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale and quartzite of Cambrian, Ordivician, Silurian, and Devonian ages in the Appalachian Ridges and Valleys MLRAs. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F."

The Berks, Carbo, and Dekalb soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, have weathered from residuum, and are on uplands. Caverns soils are well drained and coarse-loamy.  Derroc soils are loamy-skeletal and are well drained. The Frederick and Shottower soils are well drained, have redder and more clayey subsoils, in addition Frederick soils are on uplands, and Shottower soils are on high stream terraces.  The Ingledove soils do not have gray iron depletions in the argillic horizon. The Irongate, Gladehill, and Wolfgap soils have a mollic epipedon and are on flood plains; in addition, Gladehill and Wolfgap soils are well drained."
