  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Botetourt series are very deep, moderately well drained, and moderately permeable. They formed in alluvial material derived from limestone, sandstone, quarzite, and shale on low stream terraces and second bottom flood plains in the Appalachian Ridges and Valleys MLRAs. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Slope gradients are most commonly 2 to 7 percent slopes, but range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in alluvial materials from limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale and quartzite of Cambrian, Ordivician, Silurian, and Devonian ages in the Appalachian Ridges and Valleys MLRAs.

The Berks, Carbo, and Dekalb soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, have weathered from residuum, and are on uplands. Caverns soils are well drained and coarse-loamy.  Derroc soils are loamy-skeletal and are well drained. The Frederick and Shottower soils are well drained, have redder and more clayey subsoils, in addition Frederick soils are on uplands, and Shottower soils are on high stream terraces.  The Ingledove soils do not have gray iron depletions in the argillic horizon. The Irongate, Gladehill, and Wolfgap soils have a mollic epipedon and are on flood plains; in addition, Gladehill and Wolfgap soils are well drained."
