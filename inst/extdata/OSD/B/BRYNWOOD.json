See Soil Taxonomy for additional information.\nTidal phases of the Brynwood series are on tidal flats and have electrical conductivity values of between 16 and 24. These areas will be investigated during MLRA update activities to determine if a new series is needed. Brynwood soils with EC's greater than 16 would have saline-sodic properties that would change classification.\nThis soil was the Hallandale series. Hallandale has been re-classified to the isohyperhermic temperature regime. Brynwood replaces Hallandale in the hyperthermic temperature regime.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th Edition.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nOSD User Site ID: S1978FL071010\nOSD Pedon Site ID: S1978FL071010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
