  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 16 to 35 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 31 inches in thickness.  Depth to sand typically is 20 to 34 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (2 or 3 moist), and chroma of 2 or 3 (1 or 2 moist).  It is loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 (2 through 4 moist), and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is clay loam or loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4, 5, or 6 dry (3 through 5 moist); and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is clay loam, loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.  Some pedons have a C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 through 6 (4 or 5 moist); and chroma of 2 through 6 dry or moist.  It is fine sand or sand.  The 2C horizon contains as much as 10 percent coarse fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Series in closely related families are the Bowbells and Flaxton series.  Bowbells soils formed in glacial till and have loam or clay C horizons.  Flaxton soils have more sand and less clay in the upper part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brisbane soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland benches of 3 to 6 square miles.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in loamy sediments over sandstone bedrock from which the cementing agent has been removed by weathering.  Mean annual temperatures range from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Amor, Reeder, Regent, and Vebar soils commonly are on upland sideslopes.  Amor and Vebar soils do not have an argillic horizon and Amor, Reeder, Regent, and Vebar soils have a thinner mollic epipedon.  Arnegard and Grail soils are in swales and concave positions adjacent to Brisbane soils.  Arnegard soils do not have an argillic horizon and Grail soils have a fine textured argillic horizon.  Cabba and Flasher soils are on steep ridges and both are shallow to soft bedrock.  Daglum soils are in nearby depressions and have a natric horizon.  Heil soils are in enclosed depressions, are fine textured, and have a natric horizon.  Parshall soils are coarse-loamy.  Shambo soils lack sandy C horizons."

This soil is not considered prime farmland because the common crops are not grown 7 out of 10 years, fallow generally is practiced in alternate years.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
