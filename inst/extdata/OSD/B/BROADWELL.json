  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Broadwell soils are on nearly level to rolling uplands near stream valleys.  They formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying eolian loamy sand or sand.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 914 mm (32 to 36 inches)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lawndale, Pillot, Sable and Tama soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Lawndale soils are on lower lying or more nearly level areas nearby and form a hydrosequence with Broadwell soils.  Tama soils are on similar landscapes nearby where loess is more than 152 cm (60 inches) in the thickness.  Pillot soils are nearby where loess is thinner; they have strongly contrasting particle-size class of fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Poorly drained Sable soils are nearby in lower lying areas.  They have grayer colors throughout."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (423. to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and high to very high (14.11 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the lower part and in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part and in the substratum."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 cm (18 inches) (Ap, A and Bt1 horizons).  Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 38 to 127 cm (15 to 50 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 and Bt5 horizons).  Udic soil moisture regime.\nThe 2003 update relocated the typical pedon from Sangamon County, Illinois to a more representative site in Christian County, Illinois. The Sibley soils should be reclassified as Pachic Argiudolls and, therefore would not be a competing series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
