Tama soils are on similar landscapes nearby where loess is more than 152 cm (60 inches) in the thickness.  Pillot soils are nearby where loess is thinner; they have strongly contrasting particle-size class of fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Poorly drained Sable soils are nearby in lower lying areas.  They have grayer colors throughout."

Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 38 to 127 cm (15 to 50 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 and Bt5 horizons).  Udic soil moisture regime.\nThe 2003 update relocated the typical pedon from Sangamon County, Illinois to a more representative site in Christian County, Illinois. The Sibley soils should be reclassified as Pachic Argiudolls and, therefore would not be a competing series."
