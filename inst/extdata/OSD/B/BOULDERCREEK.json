  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bouldercreek soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from schist, gneiss, granitic or quartzite rocks, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 1,600 to 5,300 feet (488 to 1616 meters). The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches (762 to 1524 mm). The frost-free period is 50 to 110 days."
