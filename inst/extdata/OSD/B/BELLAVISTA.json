  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellavista series consists of moderately well drained soils formed alluvium from extrusive igneou rock sources.   Bellavista soils are on hummocky basins or adjacent low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 20 to 30 inches to the top of the duripan.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  Mineralogy is mixed.  The A horizon colors are in 10YR and 2.5Y hues and have values of 5 to 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to loam in the upper part of the A horizon and fine sandy clay loam to clay loam in the lower part.  Structure is weak to strong platy or the horizon may be massive.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and strongly calcareous.  The Cm horizon colors are in 10YR and 2.5Y hues with values of 5 to 8 dry and 3 to 5 moist.  Chromas are 1 or 2.  Structure is massive or platy and cementation is stronger in the upper Cm horizons than in the lower Cm horizons.  The uppermost Cm horizon commonly has a thin indurated layer at the top.  The lower Cm horizons are strongly to weakly cemented.  Cementing agents are lime and silica."

There are no series in the same family.  The Chiara, Lien and Skull Creek soils all are frigid.  The Honey soils have argillic horizons, the Kafader soils have duric horizons that lack induration, and the Raglan soils have cambic horizons."
