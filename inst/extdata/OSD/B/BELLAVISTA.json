  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 20 to 30 inches to the top of the duripan.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  Mineralogy is mixed.  The A horizon colors are in 10YR and 2.5Y hues and have values of 5 to 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to loam in the upper part of the A horizon and fine sandy clay loam to clay loam in the lower part.  Structure is weak to strong platy or the horizon may be massive.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and strongly calcareous.  The Cm horizon colors are in 10YR and 2.5Y hues with values of 5 to 8 dry and 3 to 5 moist.  Chromas are 1 or 2.  Structure is massive or platy and cementation is stronger in the upper Cm horizons than in the lower Cm horizons.  The uppermost Cm horizon commonly has a thin indurated layer at the top.  The lower Cm horizons are strongly to weakly cemented.  Cementing agents are lime and silica."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Chiara, Lien, and Skull Creek series in the same subgroup and the Honey, Hovey, Kafader and Raglan series in similar subgroups.  There are no series in the same family.  The Chiara, Lien and Skull Creek soils all are frigid.  The Honey soils have argillic horizons, the Kafader soils have duric horizons that lack induration, and the Raglan soils have cambic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bellavista soils are on nearly level but usually hummocky basins or adjacent low terraces.  The underlying sediments are stratified, alkaline and coarse loamy.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is cool continental with mean annual rainfall of 12 to 18 inches with warm dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F, average January temperature about 28 degrees F, and average July temperature about 66 degrees F."
