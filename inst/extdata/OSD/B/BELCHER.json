  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Belcher series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Belcher soils are on alluvial flats, lake terraces, fan remnants, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
