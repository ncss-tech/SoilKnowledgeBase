  "OVERVIEW": "The Bushpark series consist of shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from trachyte, andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff.  These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
