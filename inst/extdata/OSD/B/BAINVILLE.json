  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, and light clay loam types occur.  The A1 horizon ranges in thickness from 2 to 6 inches and generally is free of carbonates where it is more than 3 inches thick.  Colors range as dark as values of 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist in the A1 horizon or in an Ap horizon 6 inches thick.  Weakly consolidated (soft) shale occurs at depths ranging from 4 to 24 inches.  Hard strata may occur at depths greater than 20 inches.  Texture in the upper 20 inches of the profile ranges from fine sandy loam having less than 70 percent sand to clay loam having less than about 30 percent clay.  Colors are for dry soil, except as otherwise stated."
