  "OVERVIEW": "The Bainville series comprises calcareous loamy Lithosols developed from soft, weakly consolidated, calcareous loamy shales.  These soils have thin, slightly darkened A1 horizons grading into the calcareous soft loamy weathered parent material.  The Bainville series is associated with the Chama, Cushman, Flasher, Midway, Morton, and Travessilla series.  The Morton, Chama, and Cushman series have much thicker A1 horizons and have evident or distinct B horizons; the first two are Chestnut soils and the last is a Brown soil.  Fisher soils are Regosols formed in deep regoliths, Midway soils are moderately fine textured; and Travessilla soils are shallow over hard sandstone.  The Bainville series is extensive.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, and light clay loam types occur.  The A1 horizon ranges in thickness from 2 to 6 inches and generally is free of carbonates where it is more than 3 inches thick.  Colors range as dark as values of 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist in the A1 horizon or in an Ap horizon 6 inches thick.  Weakly consolidated (soft) shale occurs at depths ranging from 4 to 24 inches.  Hard strata may occur at depths greater than 20 inches.  Texture in the upper 20 inches of the profile ranges from fine sandy loam having less than 70 percent sand to clay loam having less than about 30 percent clay.  Colors are for dry soil, except as otherwise stated."
