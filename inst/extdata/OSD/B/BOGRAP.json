  "OVERVIEW": "The Bograp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. Bograp soils are mountain side slopes. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
