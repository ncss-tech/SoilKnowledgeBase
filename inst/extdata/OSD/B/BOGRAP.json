The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay and 30 to 45 percent sand in the fine earth fraction. It has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments. The upper 7 to 15 inches of the solum has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 7 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water content of 5 to 10 percent for air-dry samples.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel. Texture is ashy fine sandy loam or ashy sandy loam.

Kruse soils have hue of 10YR in the A and AB horizons, have lamellae in the Bt2 horizon, and have rock fragments of granite, gneiss, or mica shist origin, when present. McEwen soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick over stratified, extremely gravelly mixed alluvium. Nahahum soils have an albic horizon and a particle-size control section with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments of schist or gneiss origin. Neuske soils have an albic horizon. Sedlow soils are 40 to 55 inches to a lithic contact."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from andesite and Teanaway basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. Elevation ranges from 2,150 to 4,200 feet. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches. The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 145 days."
