The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from mid-April to mid-November.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The argillic horizon is 6 to 15 inches thick and contains 35 to 45 percent clay.  The combined A and Bt horizon thickness is 10 to 20 inches.  Some strata below the argillic horizon are weakly cemented.  Depth to the stratified C horizon is 20 to 50 inches.  Relic mottles may be present below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 moist and dry.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Structure is weak or moderate blocky.\nThe Bk or BC horizon is loam, clay loam or very fine sandy loam.

Acoma soils have over 45 percent sand and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Borda soils have 45 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have prismatic structure in the Bt horizon and are slightly acid to neutral in the solum.  Bowns, Mahala and Verdico soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.   Brent soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F., have an E horizon and a loam surface layer over 9 inches thick.  Chardoton soils have an E horizon and a mean annual soil temperature of 51 to 56 degrees F.  Gooding soils have a duripan at 40 to 60 inches, have an E horizon and a calcic horizon below the Bt layer.  Phing soils have medium or coarse prismatic structure in the upper part of the subsoil, have a weakly cemented layer at 20 to 40 inches, and lack secondary carbonates above 40 inches.  Poall soils are on hills, have strong prismatic structure in the upper part of the subsoil and have a solum over 60 inches thick.  Reba soils have columnar structure in the upper part of the subsoil and have 1 to 3 percent organic matter to a depth of 15 to 18 inches.  Sorf soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 51 to 54 degrees F., have 45 to 60 percent clay in the Bt horizon and have 20 to 60 percent surface rock fragments.  Spangenburg soils have 45 to 60 percent clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon and have moderate prismatic structure."

The \"more\" typical Paleargids have strong or moderate prismatic or columnar structure and clay content is higher in the upper part of the subsoil and may decrease with depth."
