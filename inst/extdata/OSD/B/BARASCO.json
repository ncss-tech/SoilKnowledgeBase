Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,610 to 1,710 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, some as snow. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C.  The mean January temperature is about 1 degrees C. and the mean July temperature is about 21 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 125 to 150 days."
