  "OVERVIEW": "The Bruneel series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that\nformed in recent alluvium from mixed sources.  Bruneel soils are on\nfloodplains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Permeability is\nmoderate through the subsoil and rapid in the substratum.  The average\nannual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air\ntemperature is about 42 degrees F.",
