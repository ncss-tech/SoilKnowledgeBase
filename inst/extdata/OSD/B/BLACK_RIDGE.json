    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the calcium carbonate cemented hardpan ranges from 14 to 20 inches. Depth to the basalt bedrock ranges from 30 to 40 inches. Rock fragments occur principally as a surface mantle.\nThe mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 50 degrees F. The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak, moderately thick to thin platy structure that parts to weak or moderate fine granular structure. This horizon is slightly hard or hard. It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The upper part is darker than 3.5 moist and 5.5 dry to a depth of over 7 inches below the soil surface but less than 18 inches. This horizon is clay loam, clay or silty clay containing over 35 percent clay. It has moderate or strong prismatic parting to moderate or strong angular blocky structure. The Bt horizon is hard or very hard and firm or very firm."
