  "OVERVIEW": "The Black Ridge series consist of shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt. The Black Ridge soils are on lava plains and lava flows. Slope ranges from 6 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak, moderately thick to thin platy structure that parts to weak or moderate fine granular structure. This horizon is slightly hard or hard. It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The upper part is darker than 3.5 moist and 5.5 dry to a depth of over 7 inches below the soil surface but less than 18 inches. This horizon is clay loam, clay or silty clay containing over 35 percent clay. It has moderate or strong prismatic parting to moderate or strong angular blocky structure. The Bt horizon is hard or very hard and firm or very firm."
