They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist, and from Tertiary granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Encantado soils are sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders and backslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Tanoan soils are coarse-loamy, have ochric epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders and footslopes of erosional fan remnants."
