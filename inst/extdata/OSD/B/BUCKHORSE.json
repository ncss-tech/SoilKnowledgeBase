  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckhorse series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone.  Buckhorse soils are on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
