  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic ranges from 25 to more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to clay ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the surface and subsurface layer, except where plowed, where it ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the subsoil, and from strongly acid to strongly alkaline in the lower part of the subsoil and substratum.  Volume of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 1 percent throughout the pedon.  Aquic conditions occur to the surface at some time in most years.  This soil reacts positively to alpha, alpha-dipryidyl at some time during saturation.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR or it is neutral, and has chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, sand, or the mucky analogs.\nThe Eg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  Clay content is 3 to 10 percent.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 5G, or it is neutral, has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 or 2.  It has pockets or strata with hue of 5YR, value and chroma of 4.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  The weighted average percent clay is 50 to 80 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2Btk or 2Btkg horizon with hue of 2.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is clay or silty clay but may have thin strata of silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Texture is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkg horizon has colors the same as the 2Btg horizon.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Texture is clay or silty clay."
