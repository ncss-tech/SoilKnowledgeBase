  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy skeletal mantle and depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The coarse fragments consist mainly of angular sandstone fragments with some rounded igneous and metamorphic gravel and cobbles present in some pedons.  The volume of channers ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Volume of flags ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Stones cover from 1 to 3 percent of the surface and stones within the soil range from 0 to 3 percent. The volume of rock fragments averages from 35 to 60 percent throughout the pedon.\nSome pedons have an A horizon consisting of very channery sand or very channery loamy sand. It has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 and chroma of 1. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nA thin E horizon is present in some pedons.  It has hue of 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very channery sand or very channery loamy sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizons have a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR; value and chroma of 3 or 4. The Bw1 horizon is very channery sand or very channery loamy sand.  The Bw2 horizon is very channery sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid."
