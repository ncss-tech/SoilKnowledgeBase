  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigdraw series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that are 20 to 40 inches deep over welded tuff bedrock.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from semiconsolidated welded tuff.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
