  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 65 degrees to 67 degrees F. The soil between the depths of about 4 and 12 inches is dry all the time from early in the spring to early in the winter and is moist for less than 90 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section during the winter. The clayey material overlying the loamy material is 20 to 35 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1 or 3/2. It is typically clay but includes silty clay and silty clay loam. Clay percentage ranges from 35 to 55. Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to a depth of more than 20 inches and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. Surface cracks are 1 to 3 cm wide and 20 or more inches deep when dry and remain open for more than 240 days cumulative and are closed for less than 60 consecutive days. Slickensides occur on 5 to 30 percent of faces of peds but do not intersect. It is moderately alkaline (pH 7.9 to 8.4) but is noneffervescent.\nThe IIC horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2, 5/2; 5Y 7/1, 7/2, 6/1 or 6/2 and moist color of 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2; 5Y 3/2, 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Clay ranges from 8 to 15 percent. It is noneffervescent to strongly effervescent.\nThe IIIC horizon when present has dry color of 5Y 3/1 or 2.5Y 6/2 and moist color of 5Y 2/1, 3/1 or 2.5Y 3/2. When present, mottles are distinct or prominent. This horizon is heavy clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay."

Ginland soils are effervescent throughout, are underlain by a buried B2t horizon and are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section during the summer. Guest soils have clay textures more than 40 inches thick and some parts of the moisture control section are intermittently moist during the summer.  Lerdo soils are fine-loamy and are effervescent. Lokern soils have clay textures more than 40 inches thick."

The climate is arid (desert) with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winter. Mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches. Summer rains are rare. Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 83 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 250 to 300 days."
