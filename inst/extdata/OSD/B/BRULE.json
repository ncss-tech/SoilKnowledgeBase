  "OVERVIEW": "The Brule series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in silty alluvium of Holocene age.  Brule soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping, natural levees in flood plains of major streams on the Gulf Coast Prairie.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.   Mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61in).",
