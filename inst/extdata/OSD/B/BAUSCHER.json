Bringmee soils have 15 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper part of the argillic and have a significant amount of volcanic ash.  DeMasters and Pinehurst soils have \"O\" horizons.  Oldbutte soils have dominantly fine and very fine sands in the sand fraction and are dry less than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Pinehurst soils have 5YR hue.  Watchabob soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bauscher soils are on fan terraces, foothills, and mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 4,500 to 7,100 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum weathered from intermediate intrusive rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Earcree, Moonstone, Riceton, and Roanhide soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Moonstone and Roanhide soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Simonton soils lack an over thickened A horizon.  Earcree, Moonstone, and Roanhide soils occur on mountainsides.  Riceton and Simonton soils occur on similar landscapes as the Bauscher soils."
