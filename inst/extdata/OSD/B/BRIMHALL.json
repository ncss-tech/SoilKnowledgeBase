The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Calcium carbonate equivalence was also determined with a field volume calcimeter.  Salinity values were determined on two pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.  Another pedon of this series was sampled for full characterization by the NSSL as pedon S85NM-045-014 (Fort Defiance SSA).\nUpdates and revisions for MLRA consistency, February 26, 2008, DWD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
