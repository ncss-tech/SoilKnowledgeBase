  "OVERVIEW": "The Brimhall series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material, alluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone.  Brimhall soils are on knolls of mesas and structural benches and have moderately rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
