  "OVERVIEW": "The Barcus series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium of calcareous sandstone and shale origin. Barcus soils are on alluvial fans and in narrow valleys and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  This horizon is 15 to 35 percent channers.  It commonly is calcareous but is noncalcareous in some pedons.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is stratified channery sand to very channery loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline."
