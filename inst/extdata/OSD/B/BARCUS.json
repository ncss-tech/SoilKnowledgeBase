Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  This horizon is 15 to 35 percent channers.  It commonly is calcareous but is noncalcareous in some pedons.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is stratified channery sand to very channery loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F."
