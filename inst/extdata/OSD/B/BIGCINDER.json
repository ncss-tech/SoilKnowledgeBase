  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigcinder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and cinders. Bigcinder soils are on north-facing slopes on cinder cones.  Slopes are 20 to 40 percent.  Permeability is rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
