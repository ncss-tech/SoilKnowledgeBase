Joes soils lack argillic horizons, are calcareous to the surface, and occur on slightly convex positions. Lanoak soils lack an argillic horizon, have a mollic epipedon greater than 51 cm thick, and occur on north facing slopes or linear/concave positions. McBiggam soils lack a calcic horizon are are on adjacent slopes.  Manila soils have a fine particle size class, lack a calcic horizon within 102 cm, and occur on fan remnants. Rexburg soils have a coarse-silty particle size class, lack an argillic horizon, and occur on south and west facing slopes."
