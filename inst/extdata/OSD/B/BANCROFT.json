  "OVERVIEW": "The Bancroft series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium from loess. Bancroft soils are on mountain slopes, hills, lava plains, and fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Lanoak soils lack an argillic horizon, have a mollic epipedon greater than 51 cm thick, and occur on north facing slopes or linear/concave positions. McBiggam soils lack a calcic horizon are are on adjacent slopes.  Manila soils have a fine particle size class, lack a calcic horizon within 102 cm, and occur on fan remnants. Rexburg soils have a coarse-silty particle size class, lack an argillic horizon, and occur on south and west facing slopes."
