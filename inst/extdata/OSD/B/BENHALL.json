These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 5,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 56 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
