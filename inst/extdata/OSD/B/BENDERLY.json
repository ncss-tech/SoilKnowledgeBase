The thickness of the A horizon is 10\nto 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and\nchroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent\ngravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It has 1 to 2 percent\norganic matter.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and\nchroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly\nloamy sand or extremely gravelly sand and has 40 to 60\npercent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobbles.  It is mildly\nalkaline to moderately alkaline."
