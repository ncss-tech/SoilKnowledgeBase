  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 39 inches. Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to lithic contact is more than 60 inches. Content of rock fragments is less than 35 percent by volume throughout. Fragments consist of gravels, cobbles, and occasionally stones. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the profile, except where surface layers have been limed. Content of flakes of mica is common or many in the A horizon and many in the B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Where value is 3 or less, this horizon is less than 7 inches thick.. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8 and may be mixed or mottled in shades of these colors. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Cr horizon is soft, weathered mica schist, mica gneiss, or pegmatite rock that has a high mica content. It is partially consolidated, but can be dug with difficulty with hand tools."

Cashiers, Chandler, Fannin, Manor, and Watauga soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock. Additionally, Fannin, Lauada, and Watauga soils have argillic horizons.  Micaville soils have paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Mt. Airy soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brownwood soils are on ridges and side slopes in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130 B). Slopes are dominantly 15 to 75 percent, but range from 8 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,500 to 3,500 feet. Brownwood soils formed in residuum affected in the upper part by soil creep. These soils weathered from rocks such as mica schist, mica gneiss, and pegmatite that has a high mica content. The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 48 to 55 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 110 to 160 days, and average annual rainfall ranges from about 48 to 65 inches."

Ashe, Buladean, Cashiers, Chandler, Chestnut, Cleveland, Cowee, Edneyville, Evard, Fannin, Glenelg, Micaville, Mt. Airy, and Watauga soils formed in residuum on ridges and side slopes.  Of these, the Ashe, Buladean, Chestnut, Cleveland, Cowee, Edneyville, Evard, and Glenelg soils contain less mica. Cullasaja and Saunook soils formed in colluvium on benches, foot slopes, and fans in coves and contain less mica."
