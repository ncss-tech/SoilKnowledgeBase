  "OVERVIEW": "The Beehunt series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone. Beehunt soils are on mountain slopes and hillslopes. Slopes range from 20 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
