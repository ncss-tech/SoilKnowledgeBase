  "OVERVIEW": "The Bogoslof series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in medium textured material weathered from volcanic pyroclastics overlying sandy alluvium.  Bogoslof soils are on flat terraces on nearly level plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic layers and features recognized in this profile include: an ochric epipedon and cambic horizon.  The criteria for inclusion in a vitrandic subgroup and amorphic mineralogy are assumed based in part on properties of like materials elsewhere on Saint Paul.  A layer or layers within 30 inches of the mineral surface between 10 and 14 inches thick and having a fine earth fraction containing 30 percent or more coarse silt to sand, at least 5 percent volcanic glass, and aluminum plus 1/2 iron percent by ammonium oxalate times 60 plus the volcanic glass percent equal to 30 or more.  In the upper part Bogoslof soils have, in the mineralogy control section, a sum of silica plus 2 times the iron (percents by acid oxalate) of 5 or more and 8 times the silica is more than 2 times the iron.  In the upper part of the control section 1500 kPa water retention of between 12 and 15 percent on air-dried samples (undried samples were not examined).  A cryic temperature regime and a strongly contrasting weighted average particle size of medial over sandy or sandy skeletal from 10 to 40 inches."
