Occasionally a thin layer of eolian sand occurs at the surface.  The weighted average particle size of the control section is strongly contrasting with a medial upper part and a sandy lower part with less than 50 percent very fine sand and less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the profile.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value moist of 2, 2.5, or 3.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value moist of 2.5 or 3, and chroma moist of 2, 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sand.\nThe BC horizon (when present) has chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe 2BC horizon has chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand or loamy sand\nThe 2C1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y; value moist of 2.5, 3, 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1, 2, 3,or 4.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.  Thin strata of silt loam or sandy loam are present in some pedons.\nThe 3C2 horizon (when present) has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value moist of 2.5, 4 , or 5, and chroma moist of 1, 2, or 3.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic layers and features recognized in this profile include: an ochric epipedon and cambic horizon.  The criteria for inclusion in a vitrandic subgroup and amorphic mineralogy are assumed based in part on properties of like materials elsewhere on Saint Paul.  A layer or layers within 30 inches of the mineral surface between 10 and 14 inches thick and having a fine earth fraction containing 30 percent or more coarse silt to sand, at least 5 percent volcanic glass, and aluminum plus 1/2 iron percent by ammonium oxalate times 60 plus the volcanic glass percent equal to 30 or more.  In the upper part Bogoslof soils have, in the mineralogy control section, a sum of silica plus 2 times the iron (percents by acid oxalate) of 5 or more and 8 times the silica is more than 2 times the iron.  In the upper part of the control section 1500 kPa water retention of between 12 and 15 percent on air-dried samples (undried samples were not examined).  A cryic temperature regime and a strongly contrasting weighted average particle size of medial over sandy or sandy skeletal from 10 to 40 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
