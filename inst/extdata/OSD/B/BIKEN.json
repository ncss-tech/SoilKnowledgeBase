  "OVERVIEW": "The Biken series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over residuum weathered from tuff and tuffaceous sandstone.  Biken soils are on rock pediments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
