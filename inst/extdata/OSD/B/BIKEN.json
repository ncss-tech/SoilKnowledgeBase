  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Biken soils are on rock pediments and hills.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over residuum weathered from tuff and tuffaceous sandstone.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
