  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The combined thickness of the Ap and A horizons ranges from 12 to 24 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Limestone, chert, and siltstone fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in the A horizons, and 15 to 75 percent in the B horizons. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and\nchroma of 3 or less. Textures are loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and their gravelly or flaggy analogues.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 3 or 4, and\nchroma of 2 through 4. Textures are gravelly, cherty, channery\nor flaggy analogues of silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have C horizons 2 to 10 inches thick with\nthe same colors and textures of the B horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Bellevue and Rossburg are the only other\nseries in this family; Huntington and Ross series are in a closely related family. Bellevue soils have stratified B horizons with sand content coarser than very fine sand of 30 to 60 percent, and depth to bedrock more than 40 inches. Rossburg soils have solum thickness from 24 to 60 inches, and less fragments. Huntington soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick, and have fewer than 5 percent coarse fragments. Ross soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick."
