  "STATES": "ID,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brodeer series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and/or colluvium from granitic or metamorphic rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Some profiles have an admixture of loess. They are on mountain side slopes, hills, and ridges. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 3 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
