    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 60 inches. This soil contains free carbonates throughout and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have an O horizon up to 2 inches thick. Drained and ponded phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is nuetral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam or silty clay but is clay loam or loam in some pedons.\nThe Bw and By horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  Mottles are few or common and distinct or prominent.  It typically is silty clay but is silty clay loam or clay in some pedons.  Few to many crystals of gypsum and other salts typically are in the lower part. Accumulations of carbonate can be throughout the B horizon. Some pedons have Bk, Bkg, or Byzg horizons.  Some pedons have Bg horizons up to 30 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a BCg horizon up to 12 inches thick.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay loam.  It has few to many crystals of gypsum.  Accumulations of carbonate are few or common."

Holly Springs soils have a buried soil with clay content greater than 50 percent at depths of 18 to 36 inches and do not have gypsum in the control section.  James soils contain salts to the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Baltic soils are in flat upland depressions and on bottom lands.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. They formed in local clayey alluvial sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 135 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

James and Salmo soils are adjacent to the Baltic soils.  Badus and Salmo soils have a fine-silty particle size control section.  Worthing soils have argillic horizons.  Badus and Worthing soils are in positions similar to the Baltic soils. Beadle soils have an argillic horizon.  Egan and Wentworth soils are fine-silty.  The well drained Beadle, Egan, and Wentworth soils are on nearly level to gently sloping adjacent uplands.  The moderately well drained Viborg soils are fine-silty and in upland swales. Wakonda soils are fine-silty, have calcic horizons, and are on slightly higher positions adjacent to the Baltic soils. The somewhat poorly drained Whitewood soils are fine-silty and are in upland swales and drainageways."

These soils pond or flood from surface runoff from adjacent slopes.  Permeability is slow.  A water table fluctuates between 2 feet above the surface to 2 feet below the soil surface."
