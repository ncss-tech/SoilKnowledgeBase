  "OVERVIEW": "The Byrnie series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from reddish colored sandstone. These soils are on gently sloping to very steep hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
