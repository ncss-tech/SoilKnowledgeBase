The poorly and very poorly drained Darwin soils have higher linear extensibility and form deep wide cracks when dry. They are on similar or lower adjacent parts of the flood plain. The poorly drained Gorham soils are on adjacent similar parts of the flood plain or on low undulating natural levees on the flood plain."

In the undrained condition, the seasonal high water table is as much as 61 cm (2 feet) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface between the months of December and July in most years. Unless protected, Beaucoup soils are frequently or occasionally flooded for brief to long duration. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) or moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate or moderately slow (0.2 to 2.0 inches per hour)."
