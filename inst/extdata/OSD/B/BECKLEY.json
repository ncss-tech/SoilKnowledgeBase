  "OVERVIEW": "The Beckley series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in outwash on terraces, old alluvial fans, and glacial outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 23 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 49 degrees to 55 degrees F. The 10- to 40-inch control section has 0 to 25 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2, 3, or 4. It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  This horizon has weak prismatic or weak subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Some pedons are slightly effervescent in the lower part.  In some pedons there is a C horizon between the Bw horizon and the 2C horizon. It is similar to the Bw horizon but is massive and in some pedons it has a value of 6 dry and 4 moist.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry. It is coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline and is effervescent in some pedons."
