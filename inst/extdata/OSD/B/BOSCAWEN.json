  "STATES": "CT,NH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Boscawen series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively and excessively drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits. They are on terraces, kames, eskers, and outwash plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 6 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the solum, and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.  Rock fragments are dominantly gravel and range from 5 to 50 percent in the solum and from 35 to 75 percent in the substratum.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is commonly moderately decomposed plant material but the range includes slightly decomposed plant material and highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Structure is granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues in the upper part of the Bw at depths less than 10 inches. Texture below 10 inches is loamy sand or its gravelly or very gravelly analogues. Structure is granular or subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has colors similar to the Bw horizon.  Texture is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand, sand, and coarse sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Oe and A horizons).\n2. Entisols - the zone from 6 to 10 inches does not meet the thickness criteria for a cambic horizon (Bw horizon).\n3. Sandy-skeletal particle size class (sandy textures and greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section: C1, C2 and C3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
