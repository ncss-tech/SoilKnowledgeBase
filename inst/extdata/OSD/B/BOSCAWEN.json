  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 6 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the solum, and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.  Rock fragments are dominantly gravel and range from 5 to 50 percent in the solum and from 35 to 75 percent in the substratum.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is commonly moderately decomposed plant material but the range includes slightly decomposed plant material and highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Structure is granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues in the upper part of the Bw at depths less than 10 inches. Texture below 10 inches is loamy sand or its gravelly or very gravelly analogues. Structure is granular or subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has colors similar to the Bw horizon.  Texture is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand, sand, and coarse sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand."

All of these soils are from outside of Region R and receive less than 34 inches of annual rainfall.\nEmmert soils are less acid in the subsoil and substratum.  Stonelake soils have a Bt horizon with clay bridging. Yellowdog soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Boscawen soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits consisting of sand, gravel, and cobbles of granite, gneiss, schist, or amphibolite. Boscawen soils are on terraces, kames, eskers, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 50 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 160 days."

Champlain and Croghan soils are on nearby sandy outwash plains and have less than 15 percent gravel. Chichester(T), Hopkinton(T), and Henniker(T)soils.  Chichester and Hopkinton soils are on till uplands. Henniker(T) soils are on till uplands and are underlain by densic material."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Oe and A horizons).\n2. Entisols - the zone from 6 to 10 inches does not meet the thickness criteria for a cambic horizon (Bw horizon).\n3. Sandy-skeletal particle size class (sandy textures and greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section: C1, C2 and C3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
