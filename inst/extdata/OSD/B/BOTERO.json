  "OVERVIEW": "The Botero series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium over outwash.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 cm (15 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F).",
