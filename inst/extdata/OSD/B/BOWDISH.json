  "REVDATE": "11/2005",
  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowdish series consists of moderately deep; well drained soils that are formed in residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and interbedded shale. Bowdish soils are on dipslopes, mesas, benches, ridges, and escarpments and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
