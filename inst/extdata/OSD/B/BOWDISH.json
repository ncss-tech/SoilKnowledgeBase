The soil formed in residuum derived dominantly from interbedded sandstone, limestone, and shale. Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 7,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 15 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 110 to 160 days."
