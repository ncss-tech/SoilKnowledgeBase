  "OVERVIEW": "The Blamer series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in materials weathered from sandstone and shale.  Blamer soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 12 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
