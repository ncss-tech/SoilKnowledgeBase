Coloso soils are somewhat poorly drained.  The well drained Dique soils are on slightly higher positions near stream channels and have less clay in the control section. Igualdad soils have clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Maunabo soils have clayey over loamy control sections.  The well drained Toa soils are on slightly higher positions within the flood plain."
