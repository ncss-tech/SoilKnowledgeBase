  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackwood series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loess of two geological ages separated by a paleosol on tablelands and uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Blackwood soils were previously mapped with the Kuma soils.  Laboratory data confirms that these soils lack the argillic horizon described as typical in the Kuma soils.  In some places Blackwood soils lack a discernable paleosol but the combined thickness of the surface and subsurface horizons form a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 34 inches (Ap, A, Bw, Bwb and Bkb horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 14 to 28 inches (Bw and Bwb horizons).\nAdditional Data: Pedon S89NE-057-007 sampled for National Soil Survey Laboratory.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nT: 5\nK: .28\nWEG: 5\nWEI: 56\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
