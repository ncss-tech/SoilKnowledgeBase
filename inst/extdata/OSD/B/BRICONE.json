    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bricone soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on linear to convex summit, shoulder, and upper backslope positions. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 2,230 to 3,560 meters. The climate is humid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, the mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 30 to 50 days."
