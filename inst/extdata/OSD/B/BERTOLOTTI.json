    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall. The upper 7 to 13 inches has 30 to 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth fraction, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron on 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 10 to 12 percent, and moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 g/cc. The particle-size control section averages 40 to 70 percent rock fragments by volume.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. Texture is gravelly ashy loamy sand, ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry. Texture is ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 5 dry or moist. The 2Bw1 horizon is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam. The 2Bw2 horizon is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist. Texture is extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid."

The Cliffdell soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and are dominated throughout the particle-size control section with rock fragments of basalt and andesite origin. The Scotties soils are 40 to 60 inches to lithic sandstone. The Deroux, Mountaineer, and Pheeney soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. The Roxer soils are dominated throughout the particle-size control section with rock fragments of Teanaway basalt and glacial till origin."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bertolotti soils are on mountain side slopes and toeslopes. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium of coarse grained metamorphic gneiss and intrusive granodiorites and quartz diorites with a mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,300 to 5,000 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches. The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F; and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
