The particle-size control section is estimated to be 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe BA horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7, dry and chroma of 2 to 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  The degree of mottling is variable and no mottles are in some pedons.  The texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

The climate is characterized by wet, mild winters and relatively cool, dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 60 to 75 inches.  The mean January temperature is 38 to 39 degrees F and the mean July temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
