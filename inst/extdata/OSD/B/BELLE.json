The particle-size control section is estimated to be 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe BA horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7, dry and chroma of 2 to 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  The degree of mottling is variable and no mottles are in some pedons.  The texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."
