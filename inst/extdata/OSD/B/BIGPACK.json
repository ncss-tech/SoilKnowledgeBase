  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigpack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic.  Bigpack soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
