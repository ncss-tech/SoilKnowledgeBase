(Bt horizons)\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone bedrock at 14 inches.  (R layer)\nSiliceous mineralogy:  Determined from lab samples on similar geologic material and landscapes in the area.\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nClassification was changed from Lithic Argiborolls to frigid Aridic Lithic Argiustolls 11/98.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nThe surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, \"Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979.\"\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
