  "OVERVIEW": "The Bukreek series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Quaternary age. These soils occur on very gently sloping terraces on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610mm (24 in) and mean annual temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
