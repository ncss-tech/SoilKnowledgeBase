  "OVERVIEW": "The Backroad series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glacial outwash.  These soils are on mountains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
