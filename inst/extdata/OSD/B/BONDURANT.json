  "OVERVIEW": "The Bondurant series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium.  These level to gently undulating soils are on flood plains of the Mississippi River, MLRA 131.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 52 inches and mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. near the type location.",

Keyespoint soils have loamy textures within 40 inches and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Openlake soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Phillippy soils are moderately well drained and are on low ridges and old natural levees at higher elevations with a clayey over loamy particle size class.  Roellen, Sharkey and Tunica soils are at lower elevations and are poorly drained. Ware soils are on low ridges or old stream terraces at higher elevations and are coarse-loamy."
