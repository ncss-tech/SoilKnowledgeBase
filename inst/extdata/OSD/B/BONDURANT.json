    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 60 to 80 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 23 inches thick.  Cracks 1 to 4 cm wide develop to a depth of 70 to 100 cm in most years. Clay content averages 40 to 50 percent in the particle size control section.  A lithologic discontinuity is at a depth of 3.5 to 6 feet. The soil ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe Ap and A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Redoximorphic accumulations and depletions, where present, are in shades of gray and brown.  Some pedons have an overwash of lighter colored materials having value of 4 and chroma 3 or 4 that is less than 12 inches thick.\nThe upper part of the Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, with few to many redoximorphic accumulations and depletions in shades of brown and gray. Texture is silty clay or clay.  The lower part of the Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, and redoximorphic accumulations and depletions in shades of gray and brown, or it is variegated in shades of brown and gray. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, and redoximorphic accumulations and depletions in shades of brown and gray, or it is variegated in shades of brown and gray. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or silt loam. Some pedons have a 2Bg horizon with colors and textures similar to the 2BCg.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, and redoximorphic accumulations and depletions in shades of brown and gray, or it is variegated in shades of brown and gray.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Eagleville and Pitco series in the same family, and the Agee and Roellen series in closely related families. Eagleville soils have limestone bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Pitco soils formed in mixed alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks in a climate with 7 inches mean annual precipitation.  Agee soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and are poorly drained.  Roellen soils are poorly drained and occur at lower elevations."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bondurant soils are on level to undulating flood plains of the Mississippi River south of it's confluence with the Ohio River.  They formed in clayey alluvium in the upper 3.5 to 6 feet and the underlying loamy sediments.  The slope gradient is 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 52 inches, and mean annual temperature is 59 degress F. near the type location."

Bowdre soils have loamy textures within 24 inches and have a clayey over loamy particle-size class. Commerce soils contain less clay throughout and are fine-silty.  Keyespoint soils have loamy textures within 40 inches and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Openlake soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Phillippy soils are moderately well drained and are on low ridges and old natural levees at higher elevations with a clayey over loamy particle size class.  Roellen, Sharkey and Tunica soils are at lower elevations and are poorly drained. Ware soils are on low ridges or old stream terraces at higher elevations and are coarse-loamy."
