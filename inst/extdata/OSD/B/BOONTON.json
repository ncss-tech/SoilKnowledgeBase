  "OVERVIEW": "The Boonton series consists of deep or very deep moderately well and well drained soils formed in till on uplands. They are moderately deep to a fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to high in the mineral soil above the fragipan, low or very low in the fragipan, and low to high below the fragipan. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1090 millimeters.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 91 to more than 153 centimeteres. Depth to bedrock is more than 122 centimeters. The top of the fragipan is at a depth of 50 to 91 centimeters. In most pedons, the upper part of the fragipan is part of the argillic horizon.  Few or common redoximorphic features are in some pedons, but depletions with chroma of 2 or less are absent within 40 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.Rock fragments of mostly rounded gravel occur throughout the soil, and range from 0 to 35 percent in individual horizons. Stones and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 0 to 20 percent in the substratum. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid in the upper part of the solum. It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum, and from moderately acid to neutral in the C horizon.\nSome pedons have O horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. In lieu texture is slightly decomposed to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have thin unplowed A horizons up to 5 centimeters thick with color and texture the same as the Ap.\nThe BA or BE horizon commonly has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR but the range includes 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Pedons with the redder hues have a higher proportion of red sandstone or shale.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is commonly moderate to weak, coarse to fine subangular blocky. Some pedons have platy structure in places.\nThe Btx or Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate very coarse prismatic to moderate or strong, thin to very thick platy. It is very firm or firm, and brittle.\nSome pedons may have a BC horizon.\nThe Cd or C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is commonly loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction but the range includes loamy sand in some places. It has weak medium to thick platy layers or is massive, and consistence ranges from very firm to very friable. In some pedons the C layer is loose friable till."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series currently in the same family.\nThe Readington, Rockaway, Turbotville, and Wooster series are in related families. Rockaway soils have rock fragments dominated by granitic gneiss and have less than 35 percent base saturation in the lower part of the solum and C horizon. Readington, Turbotville, and Wooster soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in glacial till composed mostly of red to brown shale, sandstone, basalt, and some granitic gneiss. The climate is humid temperate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C and precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1140 millimeters. Frost free season is 130 to 150 days."

Holyoke soils are shallow to basalt bedrock and usually are on higher and steeper positions in the landscape. Haledon soils have low chroma depletions in the top 10 inches of the argillic horizon and are in lower positions in the landscape, in drainageways, or at the base of steeper slopes. Other associated soils are Riverhead and Dunellen which formed in stratified, water sorted material."

CE activity class is inferred from similar soils. Geographic coordinates were determined from the narrative description for the type location.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (Ap and BA horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 38 to 127 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Btx horizon).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from 76 to 127 centimeters (Btx horizon).\n4. Densic materials - the zone from 127 to 165 centimeters (Cd horizon)."
