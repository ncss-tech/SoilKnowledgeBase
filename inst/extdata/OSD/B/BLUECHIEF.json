  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluechief series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits and alluvium derived from sandstone.  These soils are on structural benches and fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 7 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 54 degrees F.",
