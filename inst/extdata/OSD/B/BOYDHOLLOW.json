  "OVERVIEW": "The Boydhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and conglomerate. These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
