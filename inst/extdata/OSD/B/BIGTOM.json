  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigtom series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite rocks.  Bigtom soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
