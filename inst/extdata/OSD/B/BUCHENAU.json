  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils have umbric epipedons, argillic and calcic horizons (minimal argillic with 10 percent clay increase A/B); are dry for 60 consecutive days; have mean soil temperature 59 degrees F; are of mixed mineralogy.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 20 to 52 inches.  The soils have variable amounts of salt and alkali.\nThe A horizons range in color from gray, brown, grayish brown and dark grayish brown in 10YR hue; in texture from very fine sandy loam, loam to silt loam; moderately to strongly alkaline and slightly to moderately calcareous.\nThe B horizons range in color from grayish brown, light brownish gray to yellowish brown; in texture from loam to clay loam; in reaction from mildly to strongly alkaline and slightly to moderately calcareous.\nThe Ccam horizon is strongly cemented with lime and has over 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent (45 percent in official)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Buchenau soils occur on small alluvial fans formed from metasedimentary rocks.  They occur at elevations of less than 300 feet to 1,500 feet in a subhumid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 12 to 15 inches with hot dry summers and cool winters.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F; average January temperature is 44 degrees F, and average July temperature is 79 degrees F and an average frost-free season of about 250 days."

The Cometa has a claypan, the Daulton and Whiterock are developed over bedrock and the Whitney has semi-consolidated parent material of granitic sediments.  Hanford soils lack an argillic horizon and Arlington soils have weak duripans."
