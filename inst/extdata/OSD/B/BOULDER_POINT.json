  "OVERVIEW": "The Boulder Point series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in eolian material overlying glacial till.  Boulder Point soils are on glacial moraines and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In places a thin gray horizon occurs between the A1 and B2 horizons.  Colors in the upper B horizons range from 5YR 2/2 through 5YR 3/4.  The lower B horizons range in color from 7.5YR 4/4 through 10YR 4/3.  Texture in the upper 6 to 10 inches of the soil ranges from silt loam to very fine sandy loam; the lower part of the solum is always silt loam.  Depth to the stony substratum ranges from 24to mor  than 40 inches. COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cohoe, Darling, Kenai, Kroto, Strandline, and Whitsol series in the same family.  Cohoe soils have strata of sand and sandy loam in the control section.  Darling, Kroto, Strandline and Whitsol soils are not stony in the substratum.  Kenai soils have more than 18 percent clay in the substratum."
