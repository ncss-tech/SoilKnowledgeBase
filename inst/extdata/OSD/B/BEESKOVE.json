  "OVERVIEW": "The Beeskove series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from argillite, quartzite and limestone.  These soils are on mountains and trough walls.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
