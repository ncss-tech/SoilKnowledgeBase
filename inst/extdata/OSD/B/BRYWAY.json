  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bryway series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and residuum derived from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone. Bryway soils are on mesas, cuestas, ridges and hills. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
