The soil formed in residuum and pedisediments weathered from tuff of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring from July to September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 260 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

Butcherknife and Martillo soils are on Pleistocene age alluvial flats below Borunda soils.  Butcherknife soils are in the fine family and are deep to weathered tuff.  Martillo soils are in the fine family and are very deep.  Butcherknife and Martillo soils are on broad alluvial flats in lower positions.  Musgrave soils are very shallow and shallow to weathered tuffaceous bedrock.  They are on gravel-mantled low scarps.  Holguin, Reduff, Scotal soils are very shallow and shallow to tuff bedrock, and are in the loamy-skeletal family.  They are on erosional slopes, hills, and scarps.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, do not have calcic or gypsic horizons, and are on lower Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used as livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of an overstory of creosotebush, mesquite, and whitethorn acacia, with tobosagrass dominating the herbaceous layer.  Minor woody species are wolfberry, allthorn, lotebush, tarbush, and prickly pear.  Other grass species include burrograss, plains bristlegrass, bush muhly, fluffgrass, red grama, alkali sacaton, and pink pappusgrass."

The soil occurs in the ustic aridic soil moisture regime.\nSuperactive cation activity class - CEC to clay ratio 0.60 or more.  This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals in the Duff and Pruett Formations, and from laboratory data from similar soils from Presidio County, Texas. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number 95TX043027 from the type location in Brewster County, Texas.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nUpdate and revisions for the recorrelation of Brewster County, TX, Main Part, 2/8/08, CEM.\nRevised for the correlation of Presidio County, Texas ; Oct, 2012, WWJ\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Data from type location 95TX043027.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
