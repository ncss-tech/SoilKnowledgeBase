Depth to the Btn horizon is less than 5 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 5 to 11 inches.  SAR ranges from 13 to 20 in the natric horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically fine sandy loam, but is loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or loamy fine sand in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 4.  It typically is sandy clay loam, but is loam or clay loam in some pedons.  It has moderate or strong columnar structure parting to moderate or strong fine to coarse subangular or blocky in the upper part and has weak to strong prismatic structure parting to moderate, medium, or coarse subangular or blocky in the lower part.  It contains fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate and salts in the lower part of most pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly to strongly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam.  It has few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate.  It has few to many fine accumulation of salts.

It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or very fine sand loam and in some pedons it is stratified.  Typically, it has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate and fine accumulations of salts.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons do not have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is soft sandstone or siltstone, or silty or clayey shale interbedded with soft sandstone.  The bedrock is calcareous, but some layers do not have carbonates."

None these soils, except Hopsonville and Parchin, have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, Archin soils have a combined A and E horizons more than 5 inches thick, Armitage soils have greater than 15 percent coarse fragments on the surface and Rominell soils are more alkaline in the A and Bt1 horizon.   Hopsonville soils have carbonates in the Bt horizon, are very strongly alkaline in the Bt horizon and have an SAR of greater than 20 below a depth of 16 inches.  Parchin soils are 5 inches or more to the base of the E horizon and the carbonates and visible salts are at greater depths."
