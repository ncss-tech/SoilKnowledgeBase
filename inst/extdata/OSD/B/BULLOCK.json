  "OVERVIEW": "The Bullock series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loamy residuum weathered from soft sandstone or silty or clayey shales interbedded with soft sandstone on nearly level to steep uplands.  Permeability is slow or very slow.   Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
