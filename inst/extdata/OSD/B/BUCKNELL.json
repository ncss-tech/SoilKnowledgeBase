  "REVDATE": "09/2008",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bucknell series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a partially truncated, exhumed paleosol that developed in till. These soils are on convex shoulder slopes and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.",
