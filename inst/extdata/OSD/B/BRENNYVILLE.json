  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to dense till (densic contact) ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and 1 to 15 percent in the 2B and 2BC horizons.  All parts of the argillic horizon have a base status of more than 60 percent.  Stony or very stony phases are recognized in some places.\nWhere present, an Oe or Oa horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, is comprised of litter of leaves, needles and mosses.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The higher value and chroma are typical of the Ap horizon.  The A horizon is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nWhere present, the E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Redoximorphic features of high chroma are usually present.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B/E or E/B horizons have colors and textures of the E and Bt horizons.  Textures are similar to the E or Bt horizons.  The E material ranges from 15 to 85 percent and the Bt material ranges from 85 percent to 15 percent.  It is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma  of 3 to 5. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  Clay films are faint or distinct and patchy.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  Bulk density ranges from 1.55 to 1.75 gm/cc.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 5. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Clay content averages more than 7 percent. This horizon is restrictive to root penetration due to the platy soil structure, which is a property of the dense till, but is not as restrictive as the BCd horizon.  Roots are concentrated along the vertical ped faces.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.80 gm/cc.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the dense till.  This is considered to be a densic contact.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 2.0 gm/cc."

Bemidji soils have calcareous, friable glacial till in the lower third of the series control section.  Fallcreek soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the series control section.Glendenning, Hatley, Oesterlie, Plover and Rosy soils do not have a densic contact within a depth of 60 inches.  Magnor soils have base saturation (by sum of cations) of less than 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon. Magroc soils have sola terminated by bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Mora soils do not have an upper silty mantle.  Stinnett soils average less than 7 percent clay in the lower third of the series control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping ground and end moraines.  Slope range from 0 to 6 percent.  Brennyville soils formed in loess or silty lacustrine deposits and the underlying dense loamy glacial till of the Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1400 feet."

Freer soils have more clay in the control section and are lower on the landscape.  Milaca soils are well drained and are on terrain that is higher lying and are more sloping.  Mora and Ronneby soils lack the silty mantle."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Surface runoff is medium or low.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity, measured in inches per hour, is .6 to 2.0 in the silty mantle, .06 to .6 in the lower part and .01 to .06 in the underlying dense till.  A perched zone of saturation occurs as high as .5 foot during the months of April to May in years of normal rainfall."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon); Glossic horizon - the zone from 8 to 11 inches (B/E horizon); Argillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 38 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons); Other features are frigid temperature regime and aquic subgroup based upon low chroma redox within 10 inches of the top of the argillic horzion.  The 2BCd horizon is considered to be a densic contact.\nThis soil was formerly correlated as Paget (inactive).  It also includes much of what was correlated as Freeon series in Minnesota.\nThe type location was moved from Benton County, Minnesota to Mille Lacs County Minnesota to better represent the series concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 3939, 3752 and 736 for results of laboratory data on  similar pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
