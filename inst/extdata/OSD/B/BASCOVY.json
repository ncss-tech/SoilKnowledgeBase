  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bascovy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from semiconsolidated shale and mudstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, alluvial fans, and strath terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
