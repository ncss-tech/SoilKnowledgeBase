Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has color value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is silty clay or clay.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bonnefemme soils are on moderately steep to steep shoulders, lower back slopes, and nose slopes of hills.  They have formed in Holocene loess and residuum from limestone or dolomite that is low in chert content.  Slopes range from 14 to 40 percent, and are generally plane or convex.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rocheport, Clinkenbeard, Menfro, Bardley, and Winfield series.  Rocheport, Winfield and Menfro soils are generally up slope from the Bonnefemme soils, are fine-silty and are deeper to a lithic contact.  Clinkenbeard soils are generally down slope, have a mollic epipedon and are skeletal throughout.  Bardley soils have more clay in the upper Bt horizon."
