  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonnefemme series consists of moderately deep, moderately slowly permeable, well drained soils on side slopes of hills. They formed in a thin layer of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from limestone.  Slopes range from 14 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.",

They have formed in Holocene loess and residuum from limestone or dolomite that is low in chert content.  Slopes range from 14 to 40 percent, and are generally plane or convex.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

Rocheport, Winfield and Menfro soils are generally up slope from the Bonnefemme soils, are fine-silty and are deeper to a lithic contact.  Clinkenbeard soils are generally down slope, have a mollic epipedon and are skeletal throughout.  Bardley soils have more clay in the upper Bt horizon."
