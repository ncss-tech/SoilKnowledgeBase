  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 46 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 64 degrees to 67 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock or sand and gravel is 40 to 60 inches.  The soils are mildly, moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 7.8 to 9.0).  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  In some places, the profile contains up to 10 percent basalt pebbles and cobbles.  The soils are usually dry, and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for a continuous period of about 70 to 90 days in late summer.\nThe A11 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam."

These soils formed in wind-worked material over basalt or over sand and gravel.  The semiarid climate has a frost-free period of 80 to 115 days and an annual precipitation of 8 to 11 inches including 1.5 to 3 feet of snowfall."
