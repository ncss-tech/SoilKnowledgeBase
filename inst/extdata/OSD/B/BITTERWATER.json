The soil between depths of 8 to 24 inches is dry in all parts from April through November and is not moist for as long as 90 consecutive days. Mean annual soil temperature is 65 degrees to 69 degrees F. Organic matter is less than 1 percent and decreases regularly with depth. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent with some pedons containing up to 5 percent cobbles. It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, loam and gravelly loam. Clay content ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 6/3, or 7/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, or 5/4. It has subangular blocky or platy structure or is massive. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 7/3, 7/4, 8/2, or 8/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4, 7/3 or 7/4."

Cantua soils are noneffervescent to a depth of more than 40 inches.  Elkhills soils are stratified and have lithologic discontinuities within a depth of 40 inches, lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches, and have silt content ranging from 20 to 36 percent.  Kimberlina soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the control section, have 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate, and are on slopes less than 9 percent. McCullough soils have thin B2 horizons with 5YR or 7.5YR hue and sandy textures in the lower part of the control section. Seaman soils are stratified with some influence of the soil material from volcanic ash or other pyroclastic material."
