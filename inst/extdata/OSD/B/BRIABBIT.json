  "OVERVIEW": "The Briabbit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian sand from vitric tuffs and lacustrine deposits.  Briabbit soils are on foothills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Vining soils lack lime above 18 inches."
