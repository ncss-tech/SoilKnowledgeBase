  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Baffin series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils that formed in slightly fluid sandy and loamy estuarine sediments.  These nearly level soils are in shallow-water grass flats of bays and lagoons.  Water depth is generally less than 1.2 meters (4 ft).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but is mostly is less than 0.5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
