  "OVERVIEW": "The Betis series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained rapidly permeable, sandy upland soils. They formed in thick sandy sediments of marine deposits. These soils are on broad nearly level to moderately sloping broad interfluves. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 5 percent but range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in).",
