  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 20 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the weighted average content of fine or coarser sand is less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy lower subsoil (transition zone).  Volume of gravel averages from 3 to 45 percent in the stratified sandy outwash as a weighted average but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Redoximorphic concentrations are within a depth of 40 inches.  Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Aquic conditions occur within 40 inches but below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where moist value is 3, dry value is greater than 5.5.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nBrander soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt horizon described above.  Some pedons with a B/E horizon do not have a Bt horizon.\nThe 2Bt transition horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt or 3BC horizon (2Bt or 2BC horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon has color like the 3Bt horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) described above.  It is stratified layers of sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Billyboy soils average 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Brill soils are Haplic Glossudalfs that have a perched seasonal water table above the sandy outwash contact for less than 30 days duration."
