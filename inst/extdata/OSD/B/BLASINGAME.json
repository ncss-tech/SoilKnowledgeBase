  "OVERVIEW": "The Blasingame series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous rocks.  Blasingame soils are on foothills and uplands and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  Soil between the depths of about 5 and 15 inches usually is moist in some or all parts from November or early December until late April or May and is dry all the rest of the year.  Coarse fragments include up to 10 percent stones by volume.  The profile has less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.\nThe A horizon is yellowish brown, grayish brown, dark yellowish brown, brown (10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4) brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4) or reddish brown (5YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3). It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is neutral or slightly acid.  The A horizon has less than 1 percent organic matter or it has 1 to 2 percent in only the upper 1 to 3 inches in some pedons.  The lower boundary is clear or gradual.\nThe Bt horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4), reddish brown, dark reddish brown or yellowish red (5YR 5/4, 4/4, 3/4, 5/6, 4/6, 3/3, 4/3). In some pedons, the lower part of the horizon is reddish brown or red (2.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6). This horizon is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and has about 20 to 30 percent clay and about 4 to 10 percent more clay absolute than the A horizon.  It is medium acid to neutral or in some pedons it is mildly alkaline in the lower part.  Base saturation is 75 to 95 percent.  Some pedons have a B3 horizon and some have a C horizon of soil material between the Bt2 horizon and the paralithic contact."
