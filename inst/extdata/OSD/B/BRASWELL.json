  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is from 20 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, except where limed. Content of mica flakes typically ranges from none to common in the A, BE and Bt horizons and few to many in the BC and C horizons. Content of rock fragments commonly is 0 to 35 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe BE or E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. The BE or E horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. The Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or silt loam with more than 30 percent silt in the control section.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. In some pedons it is mottled in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray.  The BC horizon is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. or is mottled in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray. The gray or white colors are due to relic weathered rock material and not due to wetness. The C horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam."

Buckhead soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments throughout. Cheaha and Rawlings soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Fruithurst, Montonia, and Sherless soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Rion soils formed in residuum from felsic, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. Rome, Shady, State, and Wickham soils formed in alluvium and are on low stream terraces. Sherwood soils have bedrock at depths of 30 to 60 inches. Sugargrove and Tidings soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, and in addition have a Cr horizon of weathered sedimentary rock. Chesapeake and Kentwood soils formed in alluvial parent materials and are on stream terraces."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Braswell soils are on gently sloping to steep Piedmont uplands. Slopes commonly are 2 to 25 percent. These soils developed in residuum weathered from serecite schist, phyllite or other fine-grained metamorphic rock. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 60 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 200 to 230 days."

Tatum soils have paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, are in a fine family, have Bt horizons that have hues of 2.5YR or 10R, and contain less mica and more silt."

Rion soils contain more quartz and less mica and do not have the greasy or slick feel.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 6 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 33 inches (BE and Bt horizons)\nMLRA = 136\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
