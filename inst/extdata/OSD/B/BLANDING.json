Depolvo soils have significant amounts of volcanic ash and mica in their profiles. Hyer soils have an argillic horizon more than 25 inches thick. Nepesta soils have thick Ap horizons and have epipedons that border mollic or anthropic. Wilid soils have a hue of 10YR. Wyotite soils are calcareous throughout and have an Ap horizon 10 to 20 inches thick. In addition, Nepesta, Tensleep, Wilid and Wyotite soils are in LRR-G and LRR-E and are more moist in May and June."

These soils formed in eolian deposits derived mainly from sandstone. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees to 54 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 70 degrees to 73 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
