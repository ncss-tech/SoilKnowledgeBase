  "OVERVIEW": "The Blanding series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived mainly from sandstone. Blanding soils occur on gently sloping and rolling uplands, and have slopes of 2 to 10 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Depolvo soils have significant amounts of volcanic ash and mica in their profiles. Hyer soils have an argillic horizon more than 25 inches thick. Nepesta soils have thick Ap horizons and have epipedons that border mollic or anthropic. Wilid soils have a hue of 10YR. Wyotite soils are calcareous throughout and have an Ap horizon 10 to 20 inches thick. In addition, Nepesta, Tensleep, Wilid and Wyotite soils are in LRR-G and LRR-E and are more moist in May and June."
