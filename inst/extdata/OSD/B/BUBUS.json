Coldent soils average 4 to 10 percent clay in the control section and have soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. Valmy soils have dominantly fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in their particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bubus soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, alluvial plains, fan skirts, stream terraces, lakeplain terraces, alluvial flat remnants and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks of mostly volcanic origin, high in pyroclastic materials.   Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,200 to 2,100 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."

Reese soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and have a weakly silica-cemented Cq horizon.  Relley soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections and a cambic horizon.  Wholan soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections and a cambic horizon."
