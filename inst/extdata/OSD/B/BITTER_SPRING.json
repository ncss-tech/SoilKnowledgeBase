    "content": "REMARKS: The original type location was recovered and re-described in 2003. A sandy-skeletal control section better represents the series concept. Formally classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calciargids.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 2 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - 2 to 7 inches (Bt and Btk horizons).\nCalcic horizon - 7 to 60 inches (2Bkq1, 2Bkq2, 2Bkq3 and 2Bkq4 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - 2 to 40 inches (Bt, Btk, 2Bkq1, 2Bkq2 and the upper part of the 2Bkq3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partially sampled pedon from S59Nev-2-18, 59112 thru 59116 from Clark County, Nevada. Samples by Soil Survey Laboratory Riverside, California.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 9/2006.
