  "OVERVIEW": "The Bitter Spring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Bitter Spring soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F.",

Formally classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calciargids.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 2 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - 2 to 7 inches (Bt and Btk horizons).\nCalcic horizon - 7 to 60 inches (2Bkq1, 2Bkq2, 2Bkq3 and 2Bkq4 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - 2 to 40 inches (Bt, Btk, 2Bkq1, 2Bkq2 and the upper part of the 2Bkq3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partially sampled pedon from S59Nev-2-18, 59112 thru 59116 from Clark County, Nevada. Samples by Soil Survey Laboratory Riverside, California.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 9/2006.
