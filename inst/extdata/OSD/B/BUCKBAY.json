  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Buckbay soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches including about 20 to 40 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of December 2003 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argixerolls based on lab data for the associated Jauriga soil and the nearby Said soil.  Oxalate aluminum plus one half extractable iron and volcanic glass content in the A horizons is estimated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 12 to 29 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 29 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 12 to 29 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
