Some pedons have limestone bedrock below a depth of 60 inches.  Sulfur content is low within depths of 28 inches.  Conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 3 to 18 mmho/cm.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  This layer is less than 8 inches in thickness.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, mucky loamy sand, or mucky sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand."

Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 67 to 71 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Chipley, Leon, Osier, and Rutlege soils.  All of these soils are on slightly higher elevations not subject to flooding by tides and have base saturation less than 35 percent.  In addition, the moderately well drained Chipley soils have yellow substratums, the poorly drained Leon soils have spodic horizons, and the poorly drained Osier and Rutlege soils do not have Mollic epipedons."
