  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bayvi series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils in tidal marshes along the Gulf coast and bays in northwest Florida.  They formed in sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 69 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

Some pedons have limestone bedrock below a depth of 60 inches.  Sulfur content is low within depths of 28 inches.  Conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 3 to 18 mmho/cm.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  This layer is less than 8 inches in thickness.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, mucky loamy sand, or mucky sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand."

In addition, the moderately well drained Chipley soils have yellow substratums, the poorly drained Leon soils have spodic horizons, and the poorly drained Osier and Rutlege soils do not have Mollic epipedons."
