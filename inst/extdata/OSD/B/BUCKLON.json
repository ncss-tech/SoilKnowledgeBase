  "OVERVIEW": "The Bucklon series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from dark gray, noncalcareous shale and sandstone.  Bucklon soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
