  "OVERVIEW": "The Behanco series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone.  Behanco soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
