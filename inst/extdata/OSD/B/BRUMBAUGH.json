  "STATES": "MD,PA,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brumbaugh series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils.  They formed in deep colluvium derived from metamorphosed basic and acidic rocks.  Brumbaugh soils are on nearly level to steep lower backslopes and footslopes of ridges and along drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 51 degrees.",

Depth to mottling ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Depth to the discontinuity ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 50 percent in individual horizons of the A and B but averages less than 35 percent.  The 2B horizon rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 50 percent.  Where unlimed the soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam, with gravelly or channery analogues. Some pedons include sandy loam textures in the surface.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5, value of 2 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam with gravelly or channery analogues. Some pedons include sandy loam textures in the subsurface.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR and 5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with gravelly or channery analogues.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birdsboro, Hassler, and Roselle series.  Birdsboro soils are on stream terraces and lack a discontinuity.  Hassler soils are less than 60 inches to a lithic contact and have a discontinuity into residual material.  Roselle soils are formed in colluvium and alluvium,  shallower to the discontinuity, and are sandier in texture below the discontinuity."

The colluvium is loamy in the upper part and clayey in the lower part.  Slopes are lobed or undulating.  The colluvium is derived from mixed acidic and basic metamorphic rocks.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F and the growing season is 100 to 150 days."

Catoctin soils are on the adjacent backslopes and are moderately deep and loamy-skeletal.  Scattersville soils are lower on the footslope and somewhat poorly drained.  Myersville and Purcellville soils are on the adjacent backslopes and summits and have more than 35 percent base saturation."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Series is closely related to the Buchanan Series but occurs in colluvium too clayey to exhibit all the properties of a fragipan.  Some pedons could possibly classify as Paleudults if the clay content does not decrease above the lithologic discontinuity.\nSeries was proposed in Bedford County, Pennsylvania.  The name is taken from a small locality in that county.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Penn State Soil Characterization Lab Pedon numbers: 5-31 and 5-33.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
