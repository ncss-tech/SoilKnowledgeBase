  "OVERVIEW": "The Boyle series consists of shallow, well, or excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered mainly from granite and gneiss.  Boyle soils are on upland and mountain hill slopes and have slopes of 1 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
