  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to subhorizons with fragic properties and mottles of chroma 2 or less is 12 to 24 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral; value of 2 through 4; and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture of the A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe B1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It has none to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  It has few to common uncoated sand grains.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with more than 20 percent silt.\nThe A'2 horizon is continuous in some pedons and in other pedons it makes up as little as 15 percent of the A'2 and B2t horizon. The A'2 material has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe B2t and B3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8, or they are mottled in shades of these colors and red.  The B2t horizon has common to many uncoated sand grains and it is brittle in 40 to 60 percent of its volume.  Texture of the B2t and B3 horizons is sandy loam, fine sandy loam.loam, or silt loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has the same hue, value, and chroma as the B2t and B3 horizons.  Texture ranges from sand to clay and in most pedons is stratified."

Ackerville and Escambia soils have more than 5 percent plinthite and do not have fragic horizons.  Ardilla and Cedarbluff soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Basin soils have more than 5 percent plinthite in the fragic layers.  Bowie, Carnegie, and Cowarts soils lack chroma 2 mottles within 24 inches of the surface.  Stough soils do not have A'2 horizons."
