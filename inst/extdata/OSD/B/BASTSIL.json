  "OVERVIEW": "The Bastsil series consist of very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on stream terraces on river valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 828 mm (33 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).",
