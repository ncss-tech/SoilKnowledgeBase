  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. Depth to calcic horizon ranges from 17 to 27 inches and calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 47 degrees to 49 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 66 degrees F. In 7 out of 10 years the soils are moist 50 to 60 percent of the time in some part of the moisture control section during the period the soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F. They are continuously saturated with water for as long as 90 days within 40 inches where undrained. The A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is light clay loam to silty clay loam. This horizon is moderately to very strongly alkaline. The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is loam to silty clay loam. This horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline."

All of these soils, except the Elfrida and Winn series, have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Elfrida soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 degrees F. or more. Elfrida, Chipman, and Greenson soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the control section. Collett soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Winn soils have chroma of 1 in the A1 horizon and lack a calcic horizon."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium from limestone, sandstone, and shale. The climate is dry subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 47 degrees F. The mean temperature is 64 degrees to 68 degrees F. and the frost-free period ranges from 110 to 125 days."
