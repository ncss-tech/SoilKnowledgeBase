  "OVERVIEW": "The Braden series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on stream terraces.  They formed in alluvial sandy and loamy sediments. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

This series has been reactivated as a result of field examination of soils mapped as this series and other closely similar soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 28 inches (A, E1, E2, E3, E4, and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 28 to 44 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and BC horizons)\nA water table is between depths of 30 and 40 inches for 1 to 3 months in most years.  Flooding is rare for brief periods."
