    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction of the A horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid and ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the Bt and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value 2 and chroma 1, or value 3 or 4, and chroma 1 to 3.  Thickness is less than 10 inches where value is 3 or less and chroma 2 or less.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue 10YR, value 4 to 7, and chroma 2 to 6.  Redox features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray or splotches of uncoated sand grains with chroma 2 or less range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value 5 to 7, and chroma 4 to 8.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 5 to 7, and chroma 3 to 8.  Redox features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray range from few to many. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  In some pedons there are a few streaks or lenses of coarser textured material in the horizon.  In some pedons the lower Bt horizon has hue 10YR to 2.5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of value 4 to 7. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, hue, value, and chroma are similar to those of the Bt horizon.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to loamy sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue 10YR to 2.5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of value 4 to 7. Texture is sand or fine sand."

This series has been reactivated as a result of field examination of soils mapped as this series and other closely similar soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 28 inches (A, E1, E2, E3, E4, and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 28 to 44 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and BC horizons)\nA water table is between depths of 30 and 40 inches for 1 to 3 months in most years.  Flooding is rare for brief periods.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
