    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to more than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments are limestone gravels, cobbles, and stones and range from 5 to 40 percent in the A horizon, 35 to 65 percent in the Bt horizon, and from 35 to 90 percent in the C horizon. Reaction is neutral (pH 6.6 to 7.3) to moderately alkaline (pH 7.9 to 8.4) throughout. Some pedons will effervesce.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bloomsdale and Scioto soils. The Conotton, Dorerton, Hawksbill, Leoni, Lutzke, and Oakhill soils are in a related family and may become competitors as their classification is updated to the ninth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Bloomsdale soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium and flood frequently. Scioto soils have carbonates at 10 to 45 inches and formed in poorly sorted glacial outwash deposits. Conotton soils contain glacial outwash deposits and allow more acid reactions. Dorerton soils are loess over dolostone, and can be deep. Hawksbill soils are deep colluvial soils from Blue Ridge Mountain crystalline materials, also they allow more acid reactions. Leoni and Lutzke soils contain glacial outwash deposits over sandy material. Oakhill soils are moderately deep residuum from diabase and basalt."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benthole soils formed in colluvium from shattered limestone and limestone soil material along major drains of the Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province. Slope gradients range from 55 to 100 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 46 inches. Surface stones and boulders are common and stony and bouldery phases are recognized."
