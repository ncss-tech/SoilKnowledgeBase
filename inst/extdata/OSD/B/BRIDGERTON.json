  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bridgerton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum weathered from shale.  These soils are on escarpments, hills and landslides.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 530 mm and annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
