  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barkerville soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations of 4,000 to 7,500 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent but are dominantly 10 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium from coarse-grained igneous rock (granite and closely related rocks).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and occurs mainly as thunderstorms in July and August and as gentle rains with some snow in December and January.  Usually there is some precipitation each month of the year.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
