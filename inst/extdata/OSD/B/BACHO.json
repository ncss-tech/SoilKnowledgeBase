  "OVERVIEW": "The Bacho series consists of very shallow and shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on side slopes of partial ballenas and piedmont slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Jonnic soils have an abruptic boundary at the top of the Bt horizon and are 25 to 40 inches deep to the duripan.  Lealandic soils have duripans at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have soil temperatures ranging from 62 to 67 degrees F."

The climate is hot, and arid with summers punctuated by infrequent convection storms and winters with common rain showers usually in the months of December or January.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches; mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 200 days."
