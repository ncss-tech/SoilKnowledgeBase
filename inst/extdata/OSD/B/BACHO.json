  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Jonnic and Lealandic series.  Jonnic soils have an abruptic boundary at the top of the Bt horizon and are 25 to 40 inches deep to the duripan.  Lealandic soils have duripans at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have soil temperatures ranging from 62 to 67 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bacho soils are on partial ballenas and alluvial fan remnants.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium mostly 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is hot, and arid with summers punctuated by infrequent convection storms and winters with common rain showers usually in the months of December or January.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches; mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 200 days."
