    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Burgsblock soils are on linear to convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1000 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
