  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have ochric epipedons (less than 1 percent OM) and argillic horizons; the solum is about 28 inches thick.   Mineralogy is mixed.  The soil is usually moist but dry for at least 50 consecutive days.  Mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizons range in color (10YR and 7.5YR hues) from pale brown, brown to light brownish gray and occasionally grayish brown; in texture from loam to fine sandy loams; and in reaction from slightly acid to mildly alkaline and noncalcareous to very slightly effervescent.\nThe B horizons range in color (10YR to 5YR hues) from pale brown, brown to strong brown to dark reddish brown; in texture from heavy loam, clay loam to sandy clay loam; in reaction from mildly to strongly alkaline with the lower B horizons being calcareous; and in structure from moderate to strong and medium to coarse angular blocky.\nThe C horizons are stratified, usually mildly calcareous and lime may be disseminated or in soft masses and nodules.  The parent material apparently became calcareous under conditions of fluctuating high water table."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Arbuckle, Esparto, Fallbrook, Montpellier, Pachappa, Ramona, Sesame, Snelling, Tehama and Wyman series in the same family and the related Atwater and Greenfield soils in another family.  Arbuckle soils are gravelly and slightly acid throughout; Esparto soils are pale brown, have neutral B2t horizons and have a lithologic discontinuity at about 3 feet; Fallbrook soils have similar A horizons, reddish brown, slightly acid to neutral Bt horizons and coarse sandy medium acid C horizons; Montpellier soils are acid to neutral throughout, have red Bt horizons with reddish brown C horizons; Pachappa soils have pale brown to dark brown A horizons, neutral weak Bt horizons and moderately alkaline, stratified C horizons; Ramona soils are slightly acid and lack the abrupt AB boundary and the Bca horizon; Sesame soils have dark grayish brown to dark brown A horizons, dark brown sandy clay loam B horizons which grade into granite at moderate depths; Snelling soils lack the abrupt AB boundary and the Bca horizons.   Tehama soils have pale brown, strongly acid silt loam Ap horizons, yellowish brown, slightly acid silty clay loam Bt horizons that become neutral with depth.  Wyman soils have brown, slightly acid light clay loam A horizons and brown massive neutral clay loam Bt horizons and light brown stratified fine and moderately fine textured material that is neutral to mildly alkaline.  Atwater soils have coarse loamy B horizons.  Greenfield soils have a coarse sandy loam A horizon and a weakly developed, neutral to mildly alkaline Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur under elevations of 1,000 feet on gently sloping older alluvial fans and basin rim positions that may be hummocky under natural conditions.  They are of granitic alluvium.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 15 inches with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters; an average January temperature if 45 degrees F, an average July temperature of 79 degrees F and a mean annual temperature of 62 to 64 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 225 to 250 days."

Hanford soils also lack a B horizon and are almost uniform throughout their depth.  Pachappa soils have slightly darker A horizons and a weak B.  The Madera soils have a strongly cemented duripan at 30 inches or less below the surface."
