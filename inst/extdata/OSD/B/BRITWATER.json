  "OVERVIEW": "The Britwater series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvial sediments washed from cherty limestone or cherty dolomite uplands.  These soils are on old, high stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Doniphan soils are on adjacent uplands; are in a clayey particle-size class and have lower base saturation.  Elsah soils are on lower floodplains; are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size and do not have an argillic horizons.  Healing soils are on lower terraces and floodplains; are in a fine-silty particle-size class and have mollic epipedons.  Peridge soils are on adjacent uplands and in a fine-silty particle-size class.  Razort soils are on lower floodplains and terraces and have mollic epipedons.  Secesh soils are on lower floodplains; are in a siliceous mineralogy class and have a lithologic discontinuities. Waben soils are on similar narrow terraces, or alluvial fans; are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class and siliceous mineralogy class."
