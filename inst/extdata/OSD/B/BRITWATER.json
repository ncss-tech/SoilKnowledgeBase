  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Britwater soils are on old, high stream terraces. Slope gradients are 1 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in moderately fine textured alluvial sediments washed from cherty limestone, or cherty dolomite uplands.  The mean annual temperature is about 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 48 inches."

Captina soils are on adjacent uplands; are in a fine-silty particle-size class and have fragipans.  Doniphan soils are on adjacent uplands; are in a clayey particle-size class and have lower base saturation.  Elsah soils are on lower floodplains; are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size and do not have an argillic horizons.  Healing soils are on lower terraces and floodplains; are in a fine-silty particle-size class and have mollic epipedons.  Peridge soils are on adjacent uplands and in a fine-silty particle-size class.  Razort soils are on lower floodplains and terraces and have mollic epipedons.  Secesh soils are on lower floodplains; are in a siliceous mineralogy class and have a lithologic discontinuities. Waben soils are on similar narrow terraces, or alluvial fans; are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class and siliceous mineralogy class."
