  "OVERVIEW": "The Brody series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess including volcanic ash and in residuum and colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  Brody soils are on mountains and have slopes of 7 to 90 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
