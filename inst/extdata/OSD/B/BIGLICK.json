  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Biglick soils are on monadnocks on till plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in drift and in the underlying residuum from limestone or dolostone of Silurian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 244 to 305 meters (800 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The well drained Milton, somewhat poorly drained Randolph, and the very poorly drained Millsdale soils have limestone at 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)."

    "content": "REMARKS: Biglick soils are being converted from taxadjuncts of the Ritchey series during modernization projects in MLRA 111.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 36 cm (2Bt horizon).\nLithic contact: at 36 cm (top of the 2R layer).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for pedons WY-17 and HK-34. WY-17 was correlated as a clayey taxadjunct to the Ritchey series. HK-34 is from within the type location delineation. Data is available from the type location pedon, SS# 12941 and SS# 12942.\nRepresentative data mapunit is DMU ID 129962.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
