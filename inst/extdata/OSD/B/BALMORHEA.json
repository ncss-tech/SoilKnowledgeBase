  "OVERVIEW": "The Balmorhea series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils are on nearly level to depressional areas that are, or were formerly, spring fed marshes.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in recent calcareous silty and loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
