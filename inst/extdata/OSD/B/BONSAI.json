  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonsai series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on low broad channels of wide, shallow, intermittent streams on low Coastal Plain surfaces in North Florida.  They formed in recent sandy and loamy alluvium.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A and C horizons, and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Cg and 2Cg horizons.  Most pedons have a thick mat of medium and coarse roots in the C2 horizon and abruptly ending in or above the Cg1 horizon.  Organic carbon content is greater than 0.2 percent in all horizons except the 2Cg horizon.  Thin strata of sandy loam or finer, typically less than 0.5 inch in thickness, are within 40 inches of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or their mucky analogs.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 1 or 2.  Strata of alternating textures and/or organic matter including leaves and woody debris are commonly 0.5 to 3.0 inches thick.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y to 5GY, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1.  Few fragments of soft white mollusk shells range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam."

Harbeson and Meadowbrook soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick.   In addition, Harbeson soils have umbric epipedons.  The poorly drained Scranton soils are on slightly higher positions and are sandy throughout."
