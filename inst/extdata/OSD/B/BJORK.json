The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and is 0 to 15 percent hard rock fragments by volume.  These soils are dry more than half of the time in the moisture control section when soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 40 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It has weak or moderate structure.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Texture is clay loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam.  It has moderate or strong structure."

They formed in loess and colluvium and residuum from schist, sandstone, or conglomerate.  Elevations are 1,000 to 3,600 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 165 to 185 days."
