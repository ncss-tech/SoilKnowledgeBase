  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 30 inches. The reaction of the solum ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y or neutral; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 0 or 1. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or the mucky analogs of these textures. Where present, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR; value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y or neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Faces of peds and root channels commonly have hue of 1. It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. They are clay or silty clay. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages from 60 to 90 percent clay.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. They are clay or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Coatings on faces of peds and along root channels have low chroma. The interior of the peds contain 5 to 25 percent of the same colors as the ped coatings. The C horizon is clay or silty clay. Thin varves or lenses of silt containing a high concentration of calcium carbonate are in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Closely related soils are the Matchwood and Carp Lake series. The Matchwood series allows loamy or sandy textures in the lower part of the profile. Carp Lakesoils have less clay content."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bergland soils are on nearly level areas and in depressions on till plains or till-floored lake plains. Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. They formed in clayey till derived from clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 38 to 45 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Miskoaki, Amnicon, Cuttre, Froberg, Payseor and Matchwood soils. The well drained Miskoaki, moderately well drained Amnicon and somewhat poorly drained Cuttre soils are in the same drainage sequence as the Bergland soils. The moderately well drained Froberg, somewhat poorly drained Payseor and poorly drained Matchwood soils are coarser textured in the lower part of the solum and substratum."

Bergland soils were previously classified as active, nonacid, Aeric Epiaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (Oe, A and Eg horizons);\nargillic horizon - 25 to 48 inches (Bt horizons);\naquic soil moisture regime - gley colors from 3 to 13 inches (Eg and Bg horizons);\nvertic feature - linear extensibility of greater than 6 cm in the upper 100 cm of the profile.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to lab sample number S01MI-131-017 for Primary Characterization Data from NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
