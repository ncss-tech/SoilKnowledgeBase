  "OVERVIEW": "The Bergland series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey deposits on glacial lake plains and till plains. Permeability is very slow. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y or neutral; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 0 or 1. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or the mucky analogs of these textures. Where present, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR; value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y or neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Faces of peds and root channels commonly have hue of 1. It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. They are clay or silty clay. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages from 60 to 90 percent clay.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. They are clay or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Coatings on faces of peds and along root channels have low chroma. The interior of the peds contain 5 to 25 percent of the same colors as the ped coatings. The C horizon is clay or silty clay. Thin varves or lenses of silt containing a high concentration of calcium carbonate are in some pedons."

The moderately well drained Froberg, somewhat poorly drained Payseor and poorly drained Matchwood soils are coarser textured in the lower part of the solum and substratum."
