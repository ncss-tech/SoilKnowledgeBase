The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 60 to 80 percent including 35 to 60 percent pebbles, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, and 5 to 15 percent stones.  The soil has 3 to 5 percent stones on the surface.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry,  It is loamy sand or sand, and is extremely cobbly or extremely gravelly.  This horizon is moderately acid or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bonneville soils are on terraces at elevations of 50 to 400 feet and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial sand and gravel derived dominantly from basalt and andesite.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 65 to 75 inches.  Average January temperature is 30 degrees F; average July temperature 66 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 47 degrees to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 185 to 230 days."

Steever soils are loamy- skeletal and have a udic moisture regime.  Washougal soils are medial- skeletal."
