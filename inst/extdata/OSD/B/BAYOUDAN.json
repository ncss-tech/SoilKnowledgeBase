Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid in more than half of the thickness of the upper 20 inches.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is clay. Iron accumulations in shades of brown or red, and iron depletions in shades of gray range from few to many. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; or hue of 2.5Y or 5Y value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Vaiden soils have an argillic horizon and formed over chalk.  Burkeville and Redco soils are better drained and have matrix color that is chroma of 2 or less in the subsoil. Lacerda soils are are better drained, have more grayish color in the subsoil and typically are less acid. Lebeau soils are not as acid and have redder hue throughout. Boswell, Kipling, Raylake, Susquehanna, Watsonia, Wilcox, and Woodtell soils have a fine textured control section. Colbert soils are underlain by hard limestone. Oktibbeha, and Sweatman soils have an argillic horizon. Sessum soils have grayer colors."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bayoudan soils are on gently sloping to steep Coastal Plains. These soils developed in very fine clayey alluvial deposits of Tertiary age which have been correlated as the Jackson formation. Land slides are a common feature which mark the landscape of this soil. The climate is warm and humid. The mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees near the type location."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alligator, Providence, Maben, and Smithdale series. Alligator soils are gray throughout and are on adjacent stream flood plains. Maben, Providence, and Smithdale soils are on similar landscapes. Maben soils are fined textured and have an argillic horizon. Providence soils are fine-silty and have a fragipan. Smithdale soils have a fine-loamy control section."
