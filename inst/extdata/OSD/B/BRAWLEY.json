  "OVERVIEW": "The Brawley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from altered volcanic rocks with additions of volcanic ash.  The Brawley soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
