  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigrant series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained  soils that formed in alluvium.  They are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
