  "OVERVIEW": "The Blake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in recently deposited calcareous, silty alluvium.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (about 51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters (about 28 inches).",
