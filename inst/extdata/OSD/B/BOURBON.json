    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bourbon soils are on outwash plains, valley trains and lake plains. The slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits with Antrim shale (contains sulfur) and a small amount of gravel.  Mean annual temperature varies from 51 to 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 29 to 37 inches."

Hanna soils have a light-colored surface and are on level landscapes in slightly higher positions.  Pinhook and Quinn soils have dominantly gray subsoils and the Quinn soils do not have a dark surface layer and they are on level landscapes in slightly lower positions.  Tracy soils are brown throughout the solum and are on higher positions in the landscape."
