  "OVERVIEW": "The Bangston series consists of well to somewhat excessively drained soils.  Bangston soils are on upland hills and ridges, usually on toe slopes below areas of sandstone. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have mollic epipedons ranging in thickness from 16 to 40 inches.  They are noncalcareous throughout and have no bedrock or strongly contrasting substratums above 40 inches.  The estimated organic carbon content ranges from .8 to 2 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Typically, conductivity is less than 1 millimho, calcium carbonate equivalent less than 1 percent, and exchangeable sodium percentage less than 1.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base-saturated.  The 10-to 40- inch control section ranges from sand to loamy sand, excluding loamy very fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent but are commonly less than 10 percent.  They consist principally of small sandstone fragments.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 47 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperatures ranges from 46 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry or 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline and remains relatively constant in reaction with depth.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chrome of 2 through 4.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline and remains relatively constant in reaction with depth.\nIn New Mexico and Arizona these soils have BA and nondiagnostic cambic horizons which are part of the mollic epipedon and underlying nonalbic 2E horizons which are not.\nThe 2E horizons have textures of flaggy loamy sand, flaggy loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Also present are 2E/BT horizons below 40 inches that have a few, thin lamellae less than 1 cm thick.  Textures are very flaggy loamy sand or very flaggy loamy fine sand with total rock fragment content ranging from 35 to 60 percent in this horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Koppes (ID), Tazlina (T) (AK), and Tomichi (CO) series.  Koppes soils have slightly acid to moderately acid C horizons, expected to have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent.  Tazlina soils have long cold subarctic winters and short warm summers.  Tomichi soils are very pale brown below depth of 7 to 15 inches."

Elevation ranges from 8,500 to more than 9,500 feet and slope gradient ranges from 5 to 50 percent.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F and the mean summer temperature is 51 degrees F."
