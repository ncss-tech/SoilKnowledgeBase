  "OVERVIEW": "The Bangston series consists of well to somewhat excessively drained soils.  Bangston soils are on upland hills and ridges, usually on toe-slopes below areas of sandstone. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
