    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates range from 18 to 36 inches.  The coarse-loamy part of the argillic horizon terminates at a depth of 14 to 30 inches.  The upper sediment lacks or has as much as 10 percent gravel, and the lower sediment has 5 to 35 percent gravel.  The gravel has mixed lithology.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak or moderate granular, crumb, or subangular blocky structure.  The A2 horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak or moderate, subangular blocky or platy structure.  The A horizon is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It is friable or very friable.  It is medium acid through neutral.\nThe part of the B horizon in the upper sediment has a matrix with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay with B/A clay ratios of 1.2 to 2.0.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  It has few through many thin coatings of clean sand and silt particles in the upper part.  It has few through many thin through thick clay films in the B2 horizon.  It is medium acid through neutral.\nThe IIB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, with value and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It is massive or has weak subangular blocky structure.  It is loose or very friable.  It has few or common clay films or clay bridges between sand grains.  It is neutral through mildly alkaline.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is coarse sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction and commonly is stratified.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline and has slight through strong effervescence."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alvin, Boyer, Dryden, Eleva, Elmdale, Hillsdale, Lamont, Lapeer, Mecan, Oshtemo, Perrin, and Wyocena in the same family.  The Alvin soils have firm Bt horizons and C horizons containing dominantly fine and medium sands.  Boyer sands have the upper sola formed in sandy loam or sandy clay loam materials and commonly have a thinner sola.  Dryden, Elmdale, Hillsdale, Lapeer, Mecan, and Wyocena soils have loamy sand or sandy loam C horizons and lack sand and gravel in the lower sola and C horizons.  Eleva soils have weakly cemented sandstone at a depth of less than 40 inches.  Lamont soils have sola with fine sandy loam textures and lack gravel in the lower sola.  Oshtemo soils have thicker sola.  Perrin soils have mottles of low chroma in the lower part of the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burnsville soils have plane or convex slopes on outwash plains, valley trains, and kames of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  Slope gradients are commonly 10 to 20 percent but range from 2 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in glacial outwash consisting of a loamy mantle over sandy underlying sediments.  These sediments are Late Wisconsin in age.  The climate is midcontinental type; summers are warm; winters are cold.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches."
