  "OVERVIEW": "The Butternut series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to a densic contact.  These soils formed in a mantle of loess or silty alluvium and loamy till underlain by dense mostly sandy lodgement till on drumlins.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle, moderate or moderately slow in the loamy till, and slow in the dense till.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 30 inches. Depth to the densic contact ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Clay content in the family particle-size control section ranges from 3 to 7 percent.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle size-control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the underlying till.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the till.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout.  Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the silty mantle, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy till and in the substratum. Redoximorphic accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 to 3\nTexture: a mat of partially decomposed forest litter\nA horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 to 3\nTexture: silt loam\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon with similar hues, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3\nE horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 2 or 3\n(Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more)\nTexture: silt loam\nBs horizon\nHue: 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 5\nChroma: 4\nTexture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam\nWhere the silty mantle is thin, some pedons have a 2Bs horizon with colors like the Bs horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nButternut soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation below the spodic horizon has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination.  There is not enough clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon in the E/B or B/E horizons. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.80 gm/cc.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon, has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 (colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more).  The 2Bt part has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described below.\n2Bt horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 5\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs\nSome pedons have a 3BCd horizon with colors and textures like those of the 3Cd horizon described below\n3Cd horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 5\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: Predominantly loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand, but some pedons have sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam textures\nClay content of the dense till--ranges from 2 to 7 percent\nMoist bulk density--1.85 to 2.0 g/cc"
