When described in August 1976 the soil was moist below 20 inches). Surface has a 1cm brittle saline crust.\nAz1--0 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand with stratification and lenses of very fine sand and silt, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; few broken pieces of very hard, indurated, silica cemented lenses; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine vesicular and interstitial pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of 0.5cm to 1cm laminar layers of silica cemented sand grains granges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is warmer than 72 degrees F.  The electrical conductivity of the A horizon and upper B horizon ranges from 23 to 225 mmhos/cm but ranges from 100 to 225 in some part.  The soil is strongly alkaline above the silica accumulations and moderately alkaline below.  The upper 15 inches of the soil is moist for more than 90 consecutive days following the winter solstice and is moist continually below the Bq horizon because of capillary action from the watertable less than 10 feet below.  The soils are saturated above a depth of 40 inches for 30 to 60 days in most year.  Water is ponded during winter storms.  The particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A and B horizons has a dry color of 6/2 or 5/2 and moist color of 4/2 or 3/2.  Horizons with colors of 5/2 dry and 3/2 moist are not thick enough to qualify as a mollic epipedon.  It is stratified very fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, silt and silt loam.\nThe Bq horizon consists of laminar layers of silica cemented sand grains, with lenses of very fine sand and silt between the layers.\nThe 2C horizon consists of 10YR 6/2 or 6/3 compacted stratified loam, silt loam, and very fine sand.  Some pedons have few fine to medium distinct 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6 mottles.\nSome pedons lack buried soils below the 2C horizon."

The climate is aridic with hot dry summers with infrequent thunder showers of short duration and cool slightly moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 4 ot 5 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 70 degrees F.  Frost-free season is longer than 300 days."
