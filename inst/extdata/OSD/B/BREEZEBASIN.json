  "OVERVIEW": "The Breezebasin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and flood plain steps and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",
