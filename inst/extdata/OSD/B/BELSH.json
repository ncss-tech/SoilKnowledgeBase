  "OVERVIEW": "The Belsh series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
