    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bridgeson soils are in narrow drainageways at elevations of 1,600 to 2,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in local alluvium derived from surrounding glaciolacustrine sediments with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. They are in a climate characterized by relatively dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. Mean January temperature is 23 degrees F., mean July temperature is 65 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F., and average frost-free season is 80 to 125 days."
