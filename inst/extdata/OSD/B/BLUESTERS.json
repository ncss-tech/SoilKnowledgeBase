    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil moisture control section is intermittently moist and is dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 110 days. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to cinders is 14 to 30 inches. Reaction is neutral. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Some pedons have a C horizon which can be up to 10 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, or 2 to 5 dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is ashy sandy loam, ashy loamy sand, or ashy loamy coarse sand. It contains 0 to 35 percent basaltic gravel-size cinders and 10 to 20 percent pumice sand (0.5 to 2.0 millimeters). It contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates. Phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent. The acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.40 to 1.0 percent. Field estimated clay content is 5 to 15 percent. Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.\nThe AC horizon,when present, has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 moist dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is ashy loamy sand or ashy loamy coarse sand and contains 0 to 35 percent gravel-size cinders.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 5 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is ashy coarse sand and contains 10 to 45 percent gravel-size cinders.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR. It has value of 2 through 7 moist and dry and chroma of 0 to 4 moist and dry. It contains 80 to 100 percent cinders which are 50 to 90 percent gravel size and 10 to 50 percent cobble size."

The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 40 inches, falling mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 90 days."
