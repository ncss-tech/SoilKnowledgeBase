The melanic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. The A horizon has value of 2 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. It has weak or moderate granular and blocky structure. It is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. It is medial silt loam, medial silty clay loam, or medial clay loam. It is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, ranges from dusky red to yellowish brown. It has redox features below depths of 40 inches in some pedons. It is loam or stratified fine sand to sandy clay loam or silty clay. It is massive, single grained, or has weak subangular blocky structure."
