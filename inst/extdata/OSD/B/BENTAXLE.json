These soils are moist, in the soil moisture control section, more than one-half the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.; but are dry for 60 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice in 6 or more of 10 years. The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section contains 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 80 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is gravelly loam or stony loam. Rock fragment content is 15 to 35 percent. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very cobbly fine sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 80 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
