  "REVDATE": "05/2002",
  "STATES": "ID,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brickel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rock, with a influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Brickel soils are on mountains and ridgetops and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The soil is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 4 dry, 1 to 3 moist. Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy loam with 5 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Texture is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy sandy loam, ashy loam or ashy silt loam with 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Texture is sandy loam, silt loam or loam with 40 to 90 percent rock fragments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brickel soils are mountain slopes at elevations of 4,500 to 7,000 feet. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. These soils are dominately formed in granitic rock with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. In some areas, these soils are formed in metasedimentary bedrock.  The summers are cool and relatively dry and the winters are cold and wet. The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches including about 10 feet of snow. The average January temperature is about 19 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 58 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 80 days."

The pedon for the official type location in Spokane County has been moved to Pend Oreille County, Washington to reflect a more modal concept with Vitrandic properties.  The Spokane pedon, after further investigation during the survey update, has an ash mantle meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
