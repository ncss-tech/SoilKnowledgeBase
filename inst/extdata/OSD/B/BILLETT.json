  "OVERVIEW": "The Billett series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in water-deposited or wind-deposited loamy or sandy sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep convex crests and side slopes on outwash plains, stream terraces, or hills that border river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 885 millimeters.",
