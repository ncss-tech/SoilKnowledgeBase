It readily wets up to silt loam or silty clay loam textures.

In addition, Easychair and Swingler soils have less than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.   Rosney soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 12 degrees C and do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation following summer convection storms. Sain soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer.  Sondoa soils have relic manganese stains and are finely stratified.  Timpie soils contain 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer."

Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,375 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
