  "OVERVIEW": "The Bolletto series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on mountain backslopes. Bolletto soils formed in colluvium from tuffaceous bedrock with a minor influence of volcanic ash in surface horizons.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual air temperature about 41 degrees F.",
