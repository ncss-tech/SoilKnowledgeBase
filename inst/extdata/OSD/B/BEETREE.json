  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to lithologic discontinuity ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Coarse fragments, mostly sandstone, range from 5 to 35 percent in individual horizons. Below the lithologic discontinuity, rock fragments range from 15 to 60 percent in the colluvial component and less than 15 percent in the residual component. Surface stones commonly cover from 0.1 to 2 percent of most areas. Reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe AB, BA, or BE transition horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nBw horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt, 2BC, and 2CB horizons, where present, have hues of 2.5Y to 5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. A 2C horizon with similar colors and textures is present in some pedons weathered from soft shale.\nThe 2Cr is interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale with moderate to very high excavation difficulty."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are presently no other members of this family. The Ayersville, Citico, Kimper, Muskingum, and Pipestem (T) series are members of a similar family with mixed mineralogy. Ayersville and Muskingum soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Citico soils formed in colluvium weathered from metasedimentary rocks such and phyllite, slate and slightly metamorphosed shale, siltstone, or sandstone. Kimper soils have darker and thicker surface epipedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Beetree soils are on steep mountain slopes, often below sandstone escarpments, that range from 12 to 60 percent. These soils formed in loamy colluvium weathered from interbedded Pennsylvanian aged sandstone, siltstone, and shale spilling downslope over Mississippian aged clayey residuum. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 52.3 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 56.9 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bouldin, Gilpin, Grimsley, Jefferson, Lily, Muse, Sequoia, Varilla and Zenith soils. The Bouldin, Gilpin, Jefferson, Lily, Muse, and Sequoia soils have argillic horizons. Gilpin, Jefferson, and Lily soils are commonly located at higher elevations above sandstone escarpments. Gilpin, Lily, and Sequoia soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Bouldin, Grimsley, and Varilla soils are on similar landscapes, but they have higher coarse fragment contents. Muse and Sequoia soils are fine and located on convex slopes where the colluvial mantle is thin or nonexistent. Zenith soils are in deep coves with cool aspects and they have a thicker and darker surface layer."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Beetree series was formerly included with the Jefferson, Pineville, and Shelocta series.  The series was established to differentiate areas occurring along the Pennington (Paragon) geologic formation that have significant clay increase in the lower solum.  The Pennington Formation is a Mississippian aged siltstone, shale and fine-grained sandstone that can be identified by its distinctive shades of purple, green, and red.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 6 inches\nCambic horizon: 12 to 75 inches\nParalithic contact: 75 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization samples including this pedon from the NSSL: S06TN133044, S06TN133045, and S06TN133046\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
