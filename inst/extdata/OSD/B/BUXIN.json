  "OVERVIEW": "The Buxin series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils formed in clayey alluvium derived from the Red River. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degree F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1308 mm (51.5 in).",
