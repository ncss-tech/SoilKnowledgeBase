  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Flakes of mica range from none to common throughout. Depth to layers with 35 percent or more rock fragments by volume ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments, mostly pebbles and cobbles, are commonly less than 15 percent by volume in the A, Bw, and Cg horizons but range to less than 35 percent. Rock fragments, mostly pebbles, cobbles, and stones are more than 35 percent by volume in the C horizon. The loamy material in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section above the C horizon contains more than 50 percent fine and coarser sand. The weighted average of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout, except where surface layers have been limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. Horizons with value and chroma of 3 or less fail the thickness requirement for an umbric epipedon. Fine-earth texture is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Many pedons have an Ab horizon which has the same color and texture range as the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron or clay depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive. Fine-earth texture of individual horizons is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. This horizon fails to meet the requirements for a cambic horizon because the soil has an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with depth.\nThe Bg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or has hue of N, value of 3 to 7.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N, value of 3 to 8. Some pedons lack a dominant matrix color. Iron or clay depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive. Fine-earth texture is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron or clay depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive. Mottles or streaks of soil material are in shades of black, red, brown, yellow, white, gray, or olive. Fine-earth texture is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Pedons commonly have discontinuous strata of sand 1 to 5 inches thick that is relatively free of rock fragments."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in this family. Soils in closely related families are the Briscot, Lim, Rippowam, and Worswick (T) series. These soils are not required to have sandy-skeletal materials within a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bandana soils are on nearly level, narrow flood plains in the lower parts of watersheds in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,200 to 2,800 feet. Bandana soils formed in recent alluvium consisting of loamy soil material that is underlain by sandy-skeletal soil material within a depth of 40 inches. The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 47 to 57 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 130 to 170 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 48 to 64 inches."

Dellwood, Dillard, and Reddies soils are moderately well drained, Ostin soils are well drained and moderately well drained. These soils are typically on higher elevations in the watershed. In addition, Dellwood and Ostin soils are in a sandy-skeletal family. Dillard soils have an argillic horizon. French soils are in a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal family. Cullowhee soils have an umbric epipedon. Nikwasi and Toxaway soils are poorly drained and very poorly drained. Cullasaja, Saunook, Thunder, Toecane, Tuckasegee, and Tusquitee soils are well drained, formed in colluvium, and are on toe slopes, foot slopes or more sloping drainageways."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Bandana soils are used for hay, pasture, or ornamental crops. The rest is mainly in hardwood forest. Common trees are yellow-poplar, red maple, sycamore, eastern hemlock, and river birch. A few areas have been planted to eastern white pine. Common understory plants include rhododendron, sedges, and eastern hemlock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now included with the Bandana series were previously mapped with the Iotla or French soils. Iotla soils lack sandy-skeletal soil material within a depth of 40 inches, and French soils are in a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal family.\nThe 12/97 revision places this soil in the coarse-loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents family. CEC activity class placement based on SIR estimates and from placement of similar soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions - redoximorphic features associated with wetness in the zone from 8 to 62 inches (Bw, Cg1, Cg2, and C horizons)\nAn irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth.\nRevised: 05/94-JBA,JAK; 09/95-JBA,JAK; 09/96-BPS,DHK; 12/97-DHK ; 6/03-MKC\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference data is available from the North Carolina State University Soils Department, Raleigh, NC.\nMLRA: 130 SIR: NC0277\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
