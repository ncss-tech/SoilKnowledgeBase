  "OVERVIEW": "The Bankard series consists of very deep, excessively to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium from mixed sources.  Bankard soils are on flood plains and low terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
