  "OVERVIEW": "The Bodacious series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium over residuum derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks on foothills and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",

Bakeoven and Rockly soils are 10 to 30 cm to bedrock.Bodell soils have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges to 13.0 degrees C and have 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the upper 10 to 15 cm. Couleedam soils have mean annual soil temperature of 10.5 to 11.5 degrees C. Lickskillet soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Limekiln soils have mollic epipedons that are 25 to 43 cm thick, Bkq horizons with soil reaction ranging from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline. Plaskett soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 14.5 degrees C. at the lithic contact. Sanikara soils have a typic xeric moisture regime and lack a Bw horizon. Venator soils have reactions that range to slightly acid and rock fragments that are primarily shale channers."
