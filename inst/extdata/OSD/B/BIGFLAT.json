    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bigflat soils are on calderas, hills, and fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from basalt and loess derived from volcanic ash. Slopes are mainly 1 to 8 percent.  There are small areas that have slopes up to 35 percent. Elevations range from 1,525 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 280 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 65 to 95 days."
