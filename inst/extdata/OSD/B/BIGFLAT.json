  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigflat series consists of deep to a duripan or very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt and loess derived from volcanic ash. Bigflat soils are on calderas, hills, and fan remnants.  Slopes are 1 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
