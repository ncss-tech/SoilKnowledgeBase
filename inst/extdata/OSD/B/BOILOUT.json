  "OVERVIEW": "The Boilout series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Boilout soils are on lava plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
