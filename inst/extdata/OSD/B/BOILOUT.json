    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boilout soils are on lava plateaus and hills.  These soils formed in eolian material with a high content of volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt or tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,505 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
