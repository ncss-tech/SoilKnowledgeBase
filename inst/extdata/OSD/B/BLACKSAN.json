  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacksan series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian material from mixed sources influenced by local alluvium.  Blacksan soils are on undulating basalt plains.  Permeability is rapid.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Eginbench soils are very deep, are on lower river terraces and have an induced water table.  Engett soils are deep or very deep and are found in concavities.  Juniperbute soils are adjacent to sand dunes and lack organic carbon to meet mollic criteria.  Sandcreek soils are shallow and are adjacent to rock outcrops on convex positions.  St. Anthony soils are on lower river terraces and are moderately deep to sand and gravel."
