  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in sandy eolian material from mixed sources influenced by slope alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  Average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost- free period is 80 to 100 days."

Eginbench soils are very deep, are on lower river terraces and have an induced water table.  Engett soils are deep or very deep and are found in concavities.  Juniperbute soils are adjacent to sand dunes and lack organic carbon to meet mollic criteria.  Sandcreek soils are shallow and are adjacent to rock outcrops on convex positions.  St. Anthony soils are on lower river terraces and are moderately deep to sand and gravel."
