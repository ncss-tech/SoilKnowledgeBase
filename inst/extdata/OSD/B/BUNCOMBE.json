  "OVERVIEW": "The Buncombe series consists of very deep, excessively drained sandy soils on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain. They formed in sandy alluvium washed from soils formed in residuum from schist, gneiss, granite, phyllite, and other metamorphic and igneous rocks of the Piedmont. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 48 inches and mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. near the type location.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to hard bedrock is more than 10 feet. Layers of gravel and cobbles are in the substrata of some pedons below a depth of 40 inches. Few to many mica flakes are present throughout the profile. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. The A, Bw and C horizons to a\ndepth of 40 inches are sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. In addition, The C horizon may be fine sand within a depth of 40 inches. Below a depth of 40 inches, textures of the C horizon range from sand to loam or are stratified.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons have an Ab horizon below a depth of 40 inches that has the same color and texture range of the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon,where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. Chroma 2 or less mottles are in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches but are not iron depletions associated with wetness."

Those in closely related families are the Bruno, Molena, Thomson, and Wando series. Assatgeague, Crevasse, Malden, and Tarboro soils do not contain as much mica or do not contain mica. In addition,\nAssateague and Peveto soils are formed from marine sediments. Bruno soils have thin strata of loamy very fine sand or finer texture in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Molena and Thomson soils occur on adjacent stream terraces. Wando soils are siliceous and do not contain mica."
