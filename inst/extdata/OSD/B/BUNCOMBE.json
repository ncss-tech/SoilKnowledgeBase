    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to hard bedrock is more than 10 feet. Layers of gravel and cobbles are in the substrata of some pedons below a depth of 40 inches. Few to many mica flakes are present throughout the profile. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. The A, Bw and C horizons to a\ndepth of 40 inches are sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. In addition, The C horizon may be fine sand within a depth of 40 inches. Below a depth of 40 inches, textures of the C horizon range from sand to loam or are stratified.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons have an Ab horizon below a depth of 40 inches that has the same color and texture range of the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon,where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. Chroma 2 or less mottles are in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches but are not iron depletions associated with wetness."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Assateague, Crevasse, Malden, Peveto, and Tarboro series in the same family. Those in closely related families are the Bruno, Molena, Thomson, and Wando series. Assatgeague, Crevasse, Malden, and Tarboro soils do not contain as much mica or do not contain mica. In addition,\nAssateague and Peveto soils are formed from marine sediments. Bruno soils have thin strata of loamy very fine sand or finer texture in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Molena and Thomson soils occur on adjacent stream terraces. Wando soils are siliceous and do not contain mica."

Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The soil formed in sandy alluvium. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 68 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation\nranges from 37 to 69 inches."
