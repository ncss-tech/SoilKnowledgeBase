The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F from mid April to late November (225 days) and is above 47 degrees F from mid May until early November (170 days).  The soil moisture control section (6 inches to lithic contact) is moist in all parts early December until late April (150 days) and usually is dry in all parts from mid July until early November (100-120 days).  The soils are slightly acid to neutral near the surface and neutral in the lower horizons.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 5/4, 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/4 in the upper part and 10YR 6/4; or 7.5YR 4/6 in lower part and moist color of 10YR 4/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, or 4/4.
