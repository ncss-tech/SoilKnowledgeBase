  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to more than 38 inches.  The series control section averages between 27 and 35 percent clay and 15 percent or less sand that is fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Typically, the amount of carbonate in the pedon decreases with increasing depth.  Most pedons have accumulations of gypsum and other salts in the Bkz and BCg.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum and other salts in the upper part of the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry.  It commonly is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry.  Depth to gleying is variable, with gleying in the lower part of the Bk horizon common.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam, but is clay loam or silty clay in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam, but is silty clay or clay loam in some pedons.  Mottles increase with increasing depth.  Some pedons are underlain by clay loam glacial till below a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Calco, Lamo, Salmo, and Wingville series.  Similar soils are the Borup, Canisteo, Colvin, Harpster, Oldham, Rauville, Vallers, Whitewood, and Worthing series.  Calco, Devilsgait, and Lamo soils do not have horizons of gypsum and other salt accumulations.  Salmo soils contain more salts throughout.  Wingville soils have a drier soil moisture control section for longer periods.  Borup, Colvin, Harpster, and Vallers soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  In addition, Borup, Colvin, and Vallers soils are frigid.  Canisteo soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than 24 inches thick and are fine-loamy.  Oldham and Rauville soils are frigid.  In addition, Oldham soils have a fine textured control section.  Whitewood soils do not have accumulations of carbonate.  Worthing soils have a fine textured control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Badus soils are in swales, drainageways, and depressions on nearly level uplands.  Slopes are concave with gradients of 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in calcareous silty local alluvium overlying glacial till.  Mean annual temperature is 43 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 135 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

The well drained Egan and Wentworth soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are on nearly level to gently sloping adjacent uplands.  The moderately well drained Viborg soils do not have free carbonates above depths of 20 to 40 inches and are in slightly higher upland swales."
