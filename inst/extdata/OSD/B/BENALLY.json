  "OVERVIEW": "The Benally series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately slow and slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Benally soils are in small depressions and swales of mesas, fan remnants, cuestas, valley floors and structural benches. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches (178 mm) and average annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degress C).",
