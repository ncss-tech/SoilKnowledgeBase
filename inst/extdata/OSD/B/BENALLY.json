    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Benally soils are on small depressions and swales of mesas, cuestas, valley floors and structural benches. The upper portions of the profile of Benally soils formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The lower portions of the profile formed in weathered sandstone and shale over a base of interbedded soft sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,620 to 6,800 feet (1,409 to 1,820 meters). The average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches (127 mm) with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October. The average annual temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F (11 to 13 degrees C). The average frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."
