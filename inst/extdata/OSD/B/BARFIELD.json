  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Reaction in each horizon ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  Channers and flagstones of limestone range from 0 to about 20 percent in the A horizon and from 3 to about 35 percent in the B and C horizons.  The mollic epipedon is 7 inches or more in thickness.\nThe A and Bw horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown, olive, and yellow.  Some pedons have gray mottles just above bedrock.  The texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."
