  "REVDATE": "03/2004",
  "STATES": "AL,GA,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barfield series consists of shallow, well drained to excessively drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in residuum from limestone.  These soils are on nearly level to very steep uplands with medium to very rapid runoff.  Slopes range from 1 to about 70 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Reaction in each horizon ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  Channers and flagstones of limestone range from 0 to about 20 percent in the A horizon and from 3 to about 35 percent in the B and C horizons.  The mollic epipedon is 7 inches or more in thickness.\nThe A and Bw horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown, olive, and yellow.  Some pedons have gray mottles just above bedrock.  The texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."
