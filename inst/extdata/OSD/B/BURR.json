  "OVERVIEW": "The Burr series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils with gypsic horizons formed in calcareous clayey glacial lacustrine sediments on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 48 inches in thickness. The gypsic horizon begins within depths of 16 inches. Free carbonates are in all parts of the profile. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to l5 percent in the control section. The control section typically has less than l5 percent fine sand and coarser particles. However, some pedons have more than 15 percent of such particles, but most are gypsum crystals. The content of gypsum in the control section typically is 5 to 20 percent with an extreme range to 30 percent. The control section has 35 to 45 percent clay. Bulk density is less than 1.6 g/cc.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. It is typically silty clay loam or silty clay. Some pedons have an Ab horizon 6 to 20 inches thick.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon or Bg horizon. Properties are similar to the A and C horizon respectively.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 or less. It is typically silty clay loam or silty clay. Some subhorizons can be clay, clay loam, silt loam or loam."

They formed in calcareous clayey, glacial lacustrine sediments. The climate is subhumid continental with warm summers and cold winters. Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 22 to 26 inches."

Both of these soils lack the high content of gypsum in the solum. Du Page soils are better drained and are adjacent to the streams that cross lake plains."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity, expressed in inches per hour, is 0.2 to 0.6. Occasional flooding from overland flow may occur in some areas."
