  "OVERVIEW": "The Beaverpass series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in herbaceous and woody organic deposits overlying alluvium.  Beaverpass soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent in valley bottoms and depressions of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,200 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
