They formed in herbaceous and woody organic deposits overlying alluvium.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1500 to 3300 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 8 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."
