Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The soils formed in  volcanic ash and loess over sandy and gravelly outwash. The mean annual precipitation ranges 1,000 to 2,400 millimeters, but is dominantly 1,200 to 2,000 millimeters.  Mean January temperature is about 3 degrees C.; mean July temperature is about 19  degrees C; and the mean annual air temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free season is 180 to 220 days."

We reverted them back to Bw horizons because those were the horizons on the original version.\n>Additional observations and lab data would be beneficial to understand the ash content, illuvial processes (Bs or Bw), and presence or absence of concretions.\n4/1994:\n>Classification only changed because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy. Estimated 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 1.0 to 2.0 percent Al + 1/2 Fe by acid-oxalate extract.\n________________________________________\nLaboratory data are available on 2 pedons Lab Numbers S71WA27-3, 278-283 and S71WA27-4, 284-289.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
