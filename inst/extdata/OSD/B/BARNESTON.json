  "OVERVIEW": "The Barneston series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in volcanic ash and loess over sandy and gravelly glacial outwash. Barneston soils occur on kames, eskers, and moraines, on glacial outwash plains and glacial drift plains.  They have slopes ranging from 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,500 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

We reverted them back to Bw horizons because those were the horizons on the original version.\n>Additional observations and lab data would be beneficial to understand the ash content, illuvial processes (Bs or Bw), and presence or absence of concretions.\n4/1994:\n>Classification only changed because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy. Estimated 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 1.0 to 2.0 percent Al + 1/2 Fe by acid-oxalate extract.\n________________________________________\nLaboratory data are available on 2 pedons Lab Numbers S71WA27-3, 278-283 and S71WA27-4, 284-289."
