These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone with minor amounts of siltstone and sandstone. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1040 to 1530 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 330 days."
