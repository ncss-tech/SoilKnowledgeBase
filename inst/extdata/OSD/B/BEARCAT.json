  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearcat series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone.  Bearcat soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1285 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
