  "STATES": "LA,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bernaldo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on stream terraces. Slope is 0 to 8 percent but is are dominantly less than 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).",
