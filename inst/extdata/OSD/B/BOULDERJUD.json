Bouldercreek, Bulgar, and Bullrouar soils are very deep.  Deardorf soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Gutridge soilshave EBb and 2Bwb horizons.  Ferguson soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock and are dominated by subrounded and rounded rock fragments of glacial origin in the lower particle-size control section. Honeyjones soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock, have silt loam and loam textures and have 65 to 90 percent rock fragments in the substratum. The Stevie soils have a similar classification except for mixed mineralogy.  Stevie soils are very deep"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Boulderjud soils are on moderately dissected mountain backslopes. Slope ranges from 15 to 60 percent. The soils formed in a thick layer of coarse silty volcanic ash over weathered residuum from quartz-monzonite and other granitics. Elevations are 2,200 to 4,800 feet. The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 42 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
