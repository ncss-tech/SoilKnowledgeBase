  "OVERVIEW": "The Boulderjud series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in coarse-silty volcanic ash over sandy and gravelly colluvium and residuum weathered from quartz-monzonite and other granitics. The Boulderjud soils are on moderately dissected mountains and hills. Slope ranges from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

Bouldercreek, Bulgar, and Bullrouar soils are very deep.  Deardorf soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Gutridge soilshave EBb and 2Bwb horizons.  Ferguson soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock and are dominated by subrounded and rounded rock fragments of glacial origin in the lower particle-size control section. Honeyjones soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock, have silt loam and loam textures and have 65 to 90 percent rock fragments in the substratum. The Stevie soils have a similar classification except for mixed mineralogy.  Stevie soils are very deep"
