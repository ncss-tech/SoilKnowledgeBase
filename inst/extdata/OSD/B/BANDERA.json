  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bandera series consists of moderately deep to cinders, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils formed in cinder deposits. Bamac soils are on cone or crater landscapes. Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
