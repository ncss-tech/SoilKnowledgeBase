    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 66 to 69 degrees F.  These soils are continually moist in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days out of the 120 days following the winter solstice and are dry 60 to 80 consecutive days in more than 7 out of the 10 years in all parts of the moisture control section within the 3 month period following the summer solstice.\nRock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section range from 0 to 35 percent, principally gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loam.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline, and ranges from 4 to 14 inches thick.\nThe Bk and C horizons have a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  The particle-size control section is a loam, sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam, and averages 8 to 18 percent clay. The soil is influenced by volcanic tuff and the bulk density is estimated to be less than 1.2.  Rock fragments typically are 5 to 15 percent, but range from 5 to 35 percent.  Below a depth of 40 inches texture range from loam to sand; in some pedons they are gravelly or very gravelly and range from 10 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Reaction ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Declo (ID), Escalante (UT), Palisade (UT), Somsen (ID) and Strevell (ID) series.  Declo soils have dominantly very fine sandy loam, silt loam, and loam and contain less medium and coarse sand in the control section.  Escalante,  Palisade and Strevell soils are not influenced by volcanic tuff and have estimated bulk density of 1.2 or more.  Somesen soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Strevell soils have lithologic discontinuity to gravelly materials within the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bertelson soils are at elevations of 5,400 to 5,800 feet.  They occur dominantly on north facing slopes, on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from volcanic tuff and intermediate igneous rocks that have very low bulk density.  The climate is semiarid, and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  and the mean summer temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F. The frost free season is 115 to 125 days."

The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
