  "OVERVIEW": "The Bandarito series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and siltstone.  Bandarito soils are on fan remnants, terraces, and valley sides.  Slopes range from 3 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
