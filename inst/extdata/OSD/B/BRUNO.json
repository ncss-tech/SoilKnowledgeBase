  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is greater than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have an A horizon that is less than 6 inches with value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand, and rarely loam or silt loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown or gray in the lower part. Texture is sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand but contains thin strata of loamy very fine sand or finer textures. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bruno soils are on flood plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, MLRA 131. They are commonly on natural stream levees and where natural levees have been breached by flood waters. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Bruno soils formed in sandy alluvium and thin strata of finer texture. Near the type location, the average annual precipitation is 48 inches, and the average annual temperature is 60 degrees F."

Crevasse soils lack strata of loamy fine sand or finer in the 10- to 40-inch control section. Commerce soils are farther from the streams, fine-silty, and somewhat poorly drained."
