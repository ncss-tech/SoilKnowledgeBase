Ashmed soils have an argillic horizon with a SAR of 13 to 35.  Bitter soils have loamy sand or sand textures immediately below the argillic horizon.  Blind soils are noneffervescent throughout and the base of the argillic horizon extends to 60 inches.  Highland soils are less than 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Khyber soils are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel and contain 1 to 15 percent durinodes in the subsoil.  Nellake soils average less than 20 percent clay in the argillic horizon and less than 15 percent clay in the subsoil.  Soledad soils average less than 19 percent clay in the argillic horizon and are moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days in the summer.  Timosea soils are dry in the soil moisture control section from May to December and are moist in some or all parts for 40 to 60 consecutive days during March to May.  Topawa soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days in the summer.  Twobitter and Werewolf soils average less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Twobitter soils have accumulations of gypsum in the argillic horizon and have sandy textured subsoils."
