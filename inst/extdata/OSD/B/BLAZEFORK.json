The competing series was also changed. 05/2011. JCW\n09/2016 BKN Updated intro to current standards. Added clay content and sand content to RIC. Added Btss and Btk horizons to RIC. Changed horizon designation to proper nomenclature (Bt to Btk due to presence of secondary carbonates). Added primes to appropriate horizons (B't and B\"t). Linear, 0 percent slope, and elevation of 437 meters (1433 feet) was added to the typical pedon. Added datum to type location. Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting. Updated competing series to include Crete and Penalosa soils. Updated geographically associated soils to fit current standards. Changed permeability to Ksat. Changed MLRA from 75 to 74 and 79 in distribution and extent. Added particle-size control section, secondary carbonates, redoximorphic features, vertic features, and lithologic discontinuity to remarks. Updated Keys to Soil Taxonomy to Twelfth Edition.
