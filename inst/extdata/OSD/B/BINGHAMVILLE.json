Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the surface horizon, from strongly acid to neutral in the subsoil, and from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular, or angular or subangular blocky.  Consistence ranges from very friable to firm.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.

Akan and Evansville soils are from outside of Region R.  They have more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Biddeford and Scantic soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Birdsall soils have an umbric epipedon and are very poorly drained.  Munson soils have more than 35 percent clay in the substratum.  Raynham soils have a horizon with chroma of 3 or more within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Binghamville soils are level to gently sloping soils on glacial lake plains.  They are in depressions and drainageways and on toeslopes of swells and knolls.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent but is dominantly between 1 and 3 percent.  They formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees Fahrenheit.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 44 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days."

Munson soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Raynham and Scantic soils are on similar landscape positions.  Raynham soils have a horizon with chroma of 3 or more within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Scantic soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Birdsall soils are in lower position on the landscape, have umbric epipedons, and are very poorly drained."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 11 to 27 inches (Bg horizon).\nc. Redoximorphic features - masses of iron accumulation, iron depletions and an iron depleted matrix (Bg and Cg horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
