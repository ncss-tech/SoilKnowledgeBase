  "OVERVIEW": "The Binghamville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty glacial lacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and slow in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.

Akan and Evansville soils are from outside of Region R.  They have more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Biddeford and Scantic soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Birdsall soils have an umbric epipedon and are very poorly drained.  Munson soils have more than 35 percent clay in the substratum.  Raynham soils have a horizon with chroma of 3 or more within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface."
