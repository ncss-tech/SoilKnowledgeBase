  "OVERVIEW": "The Bach series consist of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in calcareous silty lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blount, Eastport, Gagetown, Lamson, Linwood, Londo, Minoa, Oakville, Parkhill, Pipestone, Sanilac, Sims, Tappan, and Tobico soils. The Bach soils are in a drainage sequence with the Sanilac and Gagetown soils. Sanilac soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly rounded swells and drainage divides. Gagetown soils are moderately well drained and are on the more sloping areas on the landscape. Linwood, Tobico, and Lamson soils are closely associated poorly drained or very poorly drained soils. Linwood and Tobico soils have organic surface layers. Lamson soils have noncalcareous surface horizons. Londo, Blount, Sims, Tappan, and Parkhill soils are formed in till and border Bach soils in some areas. Oakville, Minoa, Eastport, and Pipestone soils are better drained sandy soils directly associated with areas of Bach soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow or moderate depending on the texture and sequence of the layers."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Bach soils are used to grow corn, small grains, white beans, and sugar beets. Bluegrass is grown for sod purposes in some areas. A few partially drained areas are used for permanent pasture. Undrained areas grow sedges, reeds, and wetland shrubs, or a second growth of elm, red maple, ash, and tag alder. Native vegetation is mixed northern hardwoods or reeds, sedges and water tolerant shrubs in flooded areas."
