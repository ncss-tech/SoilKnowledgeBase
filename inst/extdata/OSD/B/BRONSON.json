  "OVERVIEW": "The Bronson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy and sandy materials overlying loamy sand or gravelly sand deposits on outwash plains, valley trains, and low-lying moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
