Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

Spinks soils are sandy throughout. The somewhat poorly drained Brady, the well drained Oshtemo, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford soils are in a drainage sequence with the Bronson soils.
