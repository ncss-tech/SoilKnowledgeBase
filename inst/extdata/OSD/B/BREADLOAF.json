  "OVERVIEW": "The Breadloaf series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
