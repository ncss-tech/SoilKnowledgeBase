  "OVERVIEW": "The Bow series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in gravelly glacial drift over glaciolacustrine material with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Bow soils are on broad glaciated terraces and till plains. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
