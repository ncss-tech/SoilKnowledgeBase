Coveland soils have a surface layer with umbric colors 7 to 9-1/2 inches thick and lack the influence of volcanic ash. Coweeman and Hardscrabble soils lack an E horizon and an E/B horizon. In addition, Hardscrabble soils are very strongly acid throughout the Bt horizon."

These soils formed in gravelly glacial drift over lacustrine material with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 170 to 220 days."
