    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The solum has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 30 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate including 10 to 20 percent 0.5 to 2.0 mm diameter pumice, 0.2 to 0.8 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and 8 to 15 percent 15-bar water (air-dried).  The particle-size control section has 18 to 30 percent field estimated clay 5 to 35 percent pumice, and averages more than 30 percent volcanic glass.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent pumice gravel and 10 to 20 percent .5 to 2mm size pumice.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and contains 5 to 35 percent pumice gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loam and contains 40 to 70 percent pumice gravel. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

The soil formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from mixed volcanic ash and pumice. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 2200 to 3000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
