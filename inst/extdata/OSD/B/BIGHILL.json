  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between the depths of 10 inches and the paralithic contact is usually dry in all parts from mid-July through mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be 49 to 54 degrees F.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is 15 to 50 percent throughout and usually decrases with depth.  Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or their gravelly or cobbly equivalent throughout. Rock fragment content, consisting of gravel and cobbles, ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Total rock fragment content and cobble content (when present) usually increase with depth.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 2/3, 3/2, 3/3.  It is slightly acid to medium acid.  Organic matter content is 2 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw horizon is 5YR 5/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8; 10YR 5/4 or 5/6.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 3/4, 4/3, or 4/4.  It is medium acid to strongly acid.\nThe Cr horizon is strongly weathered granitic rock that is easily dug by hand tools but retains the original rock structure."
