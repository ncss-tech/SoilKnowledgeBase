  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between the depths of 10 inches and the paralithic contact is usually dry in all parts from mid-July through mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be 49 to 54 degrees F.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is 15 to 50 percent throughout and usually decrases with depth.  Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or their gravelly or cobbly equivalent throughout. Rock fragment content, consisting of gravel and cobbles, ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Total rock fragment content and cobble content (when present) usually increase with depth.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 2/3, 3/2, 3/3.  It is slightly acid to medium acid.  Organic matter content is 2 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw horizon is 5YR 5/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8; 10YR 5/4 or 5/6.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 3/4, 4/3, or 4/4.  It is medium acid to strongly acid.\nThe Cr horizon is strongly weathered granitic rock that is easily dug by hand tools but retains the original rock structure."

The climate is moist subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 65 inches, much of which occurs as snow.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 to 55 degrees F.  Mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 150 days."
