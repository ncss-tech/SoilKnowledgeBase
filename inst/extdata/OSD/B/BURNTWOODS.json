  "OVERVIEW": "The Burntwoods series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in more recent loamy colluvium overlying older loamy colluvium in ancient landslide deposits derived from sandstone and siltstone. Burntwoods soils occur on backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of mountains. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 19 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - from 19 to 67 inches (BA, Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).\nAndic soil properties - from the mineral soil surface to 27 inches (A1and A2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - the zone from the mineral soil surface to 43 inches (A1, A2, BA, 2Bw1 and 2 inches of Bw2 horizon). The zone from 3 to 19 inches qualifies as medial-skeletal and the zone from 19 to 43 inches qualifies as loamy-skeletal. This series family classification would be medial-skeletal over loamy-skeletal if this contrasting particle-size class were approved. Below a depth of 19 inches, andic soil properties are absent primarily due to reduced organic matter and higher bulk density.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nSeries revision date - Classification revised 08/2002 from medial-skeletal, ferrihydritic, frigid Alic Hapludands to medial-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Fulvudands based on laboratory data for the typical pedon."
