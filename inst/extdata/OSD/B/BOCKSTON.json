  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bockston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid to rapid in the lower part. The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",
