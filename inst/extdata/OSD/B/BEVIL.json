    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The range in characteristics includes 50 percent or more of the pedon unless otherwise stated.  Solum thickness is more than 203 cm (80 in).  Texture is clay or silty clay throughout.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section is 45 to 60 percent.  This cyclic soil ranges from about 1 to 3.9 m (3 to 12 ft) from the top of the microhigh to the center of the microlow.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 in) above the microlows.  The microhighs comprise about 30 percent, the microlows about 50 percent, and the intermediate areas about 20 percent.  When dry, cracks 1 to 3 cm (0.5 to 1 in) wide occur at the surface which extend to a depth of 30 cm (12 in) or more.  Cracks remain open for less than 60 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and wedge shaped peds begin at a depth of 30 to 64 (12 to 25 in).  Iron manganese concretions and/or masses range from few to common.  These soils have aquic soil conditions within 30 cm (12 in) of the surface in most years.\nSoil Moisture: An aquic soil moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature: 20.6 to 21.7 degrees C (69 to 71 degrees F)\nAg Horizon\nHue: 10YR to N\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1\nTexture: silt loam, silty clay loam, clay or silty clay (pedons with silt loam or silty clay loam are less than 13 cm [5 in] thick)\nRedox concentrations: amount-few to common, location-lining pores and root channels, shades-brown or yellow\nReaction: extremely acid or very strongly acid\nBg Horizon\nHue: 10YR to N\nValue: 4 to 7\nChroma: 1\nTexture: clay or silty clay\nRedox concentrations: amount-common to many, location-lining pores and root channels, shades-brown or yellow\nReaction: extremely acid or very strongly acid\nBssg Horizon\nHue: 10YR to N\nValue: 4 to 7\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: clay or silty clay\nRedox concentrations: amount-common to many, location-lining pores and root channels, shades-brown, red or yellow\nReaction: very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part; very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part"
