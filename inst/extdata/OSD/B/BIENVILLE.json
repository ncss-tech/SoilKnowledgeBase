Total fines (clay, silt, and very fine sand) range from 30 to 50 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon and the E part of the B/E or E/B horizon have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6 throughout.  Some pedons have subhorizons of the Bt horizon with hue of 10YR.  In some pedons parts of the Bt horizon consists of a series of lamellae.  The upper part of the Bt horizon is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  The lower part is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction in the Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid."

Alaga, Hainesville, and Kershaw soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Benndale and Elysian soils have coarse-loamy texture in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Eustis soils have less than 30 percent fines (clay, silt, and very fine sand) and have base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Flo soils do not have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 6 feet.  Glenpool soils are on higher Pleistocene age terraces and do not have a high water table within a depth of 6 feet."

A water table is at depths of 4 to 6 feet in late winter and early spring.  These soils formed in sandy alluvium mainly from sandy coastal plain sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.
