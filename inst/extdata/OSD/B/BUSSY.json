Byler and Byram soils\nare underlain by alkaline clays.  Calloway, Grenada, and Loring\nsoils have mixed mineralogy and less than 10 percent sand\nthroughout the solum.  Gigger and Providence soils have mixed mineralogy.  Libuse soils have more than 20 percent sand in the\nlower horizons.  Necessity soils have 1 or 2 chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Shatta soils have less than\n35 percent base saturation at 30 inches below the top of the\nfragipan argillic horizon."

The soil formed in a thick silty mantle of loess over loamy Southern Coastal Plain sediments.  The climate is warm\nand humid.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and\nthe mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F. near the type location."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Bussy soils were formerly included with the Loring\nseries in mapping.  In addition to having siliceous rather than\nmixed mineralogy and by having more than 10 percent sand\nthroughout the solum they have lower yields for commonly grown\ncrops.  This is due primarily to high levels of exchangeable\naluminum through the control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches, (the A and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 9 inches to a depth of 65 inches, (the Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btx1, Btx2 and Btx3 horizons.)\nFragipan - the zone from a depth of 35 inches to a depth of 65 inches, (the Btx1, Btx2 and Btx3 horizons.)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU. S. A."
