  "OVERVIEW": "The Bussy series consists of deep, moderately well drained,\nslowly permeable soils with fragipans that formed in loess.  They\nare on nearly level to sloping Pleistocene age terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  A seasonal high water table is perched above the fragipan for short periods during the winter and early spring.  Water runs off the surface at a slow to medium rate.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Bussy soils were formerly included with the Loring\nseries in mapping.  In addition to having siliceous rather than\nmixed mineralogy and by having more than 10 percent sand\nthroughout the solum they have lower yields for commonly grown\ncrops.  This is due primarily to high levels of exchangeable\naluminum through the control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches, (the A and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 9 inches to a depth of 65 inches, (the Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btx1, Btx2 and Btx3 horizons.)\nFragipan - the zone from a depth of 35 inches to a depth of 65 inches, (the Btx1, Btx2 and Btx3 horizons.)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.
