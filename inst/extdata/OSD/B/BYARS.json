Bayboro, Bethera, Bladen, Cantey, Cape Fear,  Coxville, Grady, Hyde, Leaf, Paxville, Pantego, and Santee series are similar soils in other families.  Bayboro, Bethera, Bladen, Cape Fear, Hyde, Leaf, and Santee soils have mixed mineralogy.  Cantey, Coxville, and Grady soils have an ochric epipedon.  Paxville and Pantego soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

They formed in clayey and loamy marine sediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F., the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 50 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 190 to 260 days.  Average July temperature is 81 degrees F.  and average January temperature is 47 degrees F."
