Few to common flakes of mica are in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, or it is neutral, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Most pedons have few to many mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  The Btg horizon is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

Bayboro, Bethera, Bladen, Cantey, Cape Fear,  Coxville, Grady, Hyde, Leaf, Paxville, Pantego, and Santee series are similar soils in other families.  Bayboro, Bethera, Bladen, Cape Fear, Hyde, Leaf, and Santee soils have mixed mineralogy.  Cantey, Coxville, and Grady soils have an ochric epipedon.  Paxville and Pantego soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
