  "OVERVIEW": "The Bear Lake series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils on low terraces and bottomlands.  They formed in alluvium from lake sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow and slow.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
