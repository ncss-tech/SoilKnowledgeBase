  "OVERVIEW": "The Beavmid series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants and outwash terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
