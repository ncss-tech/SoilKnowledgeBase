  "OVERVIEW": "The Browndell series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on interfluves. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils have formed from acid, tuffaceous siltstones, and sandstones. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in).",
