  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Bellspur soils were previously mapped as Cowee soils. Soil creep is evident in pedons on steep and very steep slopes. Few faint clay films in the B horizon indicate translocation of clay has occurred; however, laboratory data does not support an argillic horizon. Bellspur soils have a dark surface that is too thin for an Umbric epipedon. It is anticipated once the current Humudepts/Dystrudepts taxonomy proposal is approved, Bellspur soils will be reclassified as Humic Dystrudepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from 8 to 28 inches (Bt and BC horizons)\nParalithic contact--35 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)\nParalithic materials--35 to 41 inches (Cr layer)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 41 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (Lab Pedon Number: 99P0438; User Pedon ID: 99VA141001).\nData Map Unit ID: 533811\nPedon Record ID: 260229\nUser Pedon ID: VA141_Bellspur_OSD_grl\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
