Aquariusmine is found on lower portions of the hillslope and are deep to a lithic contact. Mercercave and Tiger Creek are mesic soils, occupying cooler aspects and higher elevations. Mercercave is deep. Tiger Creek is fine-loamy and has hues as red as 10R. Millvilla, Wardsferry, Priestgrade, Moccasinhill, and Sanguinetti develop from schist, phyllite and other metasedimentary rocks. Millvilla and Wardsferry are fine-loamy whereas Priestgrade, Moccasinhill, and Sanguinetti are loamy-skeletal."

Vegetation consists of hardwoods, mainly blue oak, with an understory of annual grasses and forbs. Understory species include brome, clover, ryegrass, wild oat, and bedstraw. In some places the cover is dominated by shrubs, which is mostly chamise and likely a response to fire."
