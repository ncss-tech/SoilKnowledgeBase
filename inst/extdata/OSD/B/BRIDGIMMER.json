  "REVDATE": "05/2011",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bridgimmer series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  These soils are on escarpments, hills and pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
