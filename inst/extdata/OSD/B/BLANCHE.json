  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blanche series consists of well drained, moderately deep, moderately rapid permeable soils formed in loamy calcareous residuum on uplands. These soils are moderately deep over weakly cemented limestone and very fine-grained sandstone of the Ogallala formation. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",
