The soil is dry for 50 to 60 percent of the time; the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. They are usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days out of the 120 days following June 21.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering in xeric.\nThe particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is strongly effervescent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  There are less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Some pedons have sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very gravelly loamy sand below the particle-size control section."
