  "REVDATE": "2/79",
  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bristow series consists of shallow, well drained slowly permeable soils formed in light colored shales.  The upland soils have slopes ranging from 6 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to shale typically is 8 to 16 inches and ranges from 5 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the solum is 5 to 10 inches.  Reaction in the solum is mildly or moderately alkaline and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  The carbonate free clay ranges from 38 to 55 percent in the control section.  The soil colors are largely inherited from the parent shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Dominant texture is silty clay and less frequently heavy silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It contains from 30 to 40 percent calcium carbonates and gypsum in seams and fractures."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Bristow is the only series in this family.  Similar soils are Lynch, Okaton, and Sansarc.  Lynch soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to light colored shale.  Okaton and Sansarc soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and lack the high amount of gypsum in the parent shale.  Also, Sansarc soils are formed in dark shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bristow soils have steep slopes in areas called breaks or dissected shale plains.  Slope gradients range from 6 to over 60 percent.  They are formed in clay residuum weathered from light colored, calcareous, gypsiferous, soft shales.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boyd, Lakoma, Lynch, Promise, Reliance, and Sansarc.  The Boyd, Lakoma, Lynch, and Promise soils occupy more gentle slopes below Bristow and are deeper to shale.  Reliance soils are deeper, developed in loess and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and are on nearly level to gently sloping areas.  Sansarc soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and lack the high amount of gypsum.  They occur generally above Bristow."
