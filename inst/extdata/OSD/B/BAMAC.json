  "OVERVIEW": "The Bamac series consists of very deep, excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from conglomerate and sandstone. Bamac soils are on fan terraces, fan remnants, hills, and ridges. Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
