  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Coarse fragments, mostly siliceous limestone, siltstone and shale, range from 0 to 20 percent in the A horizon, 5 to 35 percent in the Bt horizons, and 40 to 70 percent in the BC horizons and C horizons where present.  Cr horizons occur in some pedons.  Reaction throughout the solum commonly ranges from medium acid to slightly acid, but includes individual subhorizons of strongly acid.\nAp horizons have hue of 10YR, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 4 to 6.  Uncultivated areas have a thin A horizon of 10YR hue with values of 2 or 3, and chromas of 2 or 3; and an E horizon with values of 5 or 6, and chromas of 3 or 4.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 5 or 6, and chromas of 4 to 8.  It commonly is silt loam, but includes silty clay loam.  BA horizons are less than 6 inches thick.\nBt horizons have hues commonly of 10YR or 7.5YR, rarely of 5YR, values of 5 or 6, and chromas of 4 to 8.  Bt horizons are heavy silt loam, light clay loam, or gravelly, channery, of shaly analogues.\nBC horizons have 5YR or 2.5YR hue with value of 4 or 5, and chromas of 6 or 8.  The texture is very gravelly or very channery silty clay loam or very channery silty clay.  C horizons, where present, are similar to BC horizons except they lack clay films.  Cr horizons, where present, are highly variable and unpredictable depending on local conditions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bookwood soils formed in residuum weathered from siliceous limestone and interbedded calcareous shale and siltstone on gently sloping to steep uplands of the Limestone Valley.  Slopes are commonly between 7 and 25 percent, but range from 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature near the type location averages about 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches."

They have thicker sola, have less than 35 percent base saturation, and more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Endcav soils are on the smoother slopes.  They have a thicker sola and more than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Timberville soils occur along the small streams and drainageways.  They have less than 35 percent base saturation."

Data taken from several sites indicates base saturation of these soils is between 35 and 60 percent.\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data from Augusta County, Virginia. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. In addition, horizon nomenclature and competing series were updated with this revision.\nPrevious revision JRH-RLG 2/85\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Chemical data from typical pedon (Lab No. 72-045, 72-046, 72-047, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Soil Survey Lab).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
