    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  The soils are saturated during the winter and spring.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section is 35 to 50 percent organic matter, the lower part of the particle-size control section has more than 60 percent volcanic glass, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent.  The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Organic carbon in the Oap horizon ranges from 20 to 30 percent.\nThe Ag horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, through 7 moist, and chroma of 0 through 3 moist and dry.,  Mottles range from few fine faint to many medium distinct.  It is commonly ashy silt loam and less commonly stratified fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam and silt loam.\nThe 3Oa2 layer is lacking in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bossburg soils are on bottomlands, flood plains, and old lake basins at elevations of 1,000 to 2,800 feet.  The topography is smooth or gently undulating with slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean January temperature is 23 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 25 inches.  The frost-free season is about 100 to 125 days."

Bridgeson, Konner, Narcisse, Poween, and Ralsen soils are not ashy and lack a histic epipedon.  Saltese soils are organic soils. Peone soils lack a mollic epipedon and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon."
