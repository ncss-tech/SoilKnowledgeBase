    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F. and the mean annual summer soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F. The soils are usually dry, and are dry for 45 to 80 consecutive days during the late summer. The mollic epipedon is 6 to 11 inches thick. The sola are 13 to 20 inches thick. Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 13 to 20 inches. The calcic horizon contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate.  Between depths of 10 and 20 inches, or deeper, the soils is dominantly loam, ranging to silt loam or gravelly loam, and contains less than 18 percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand and less than 35 percent rock fragments. Stratification with coarser strata occurs below depths of 20 to 35 inches in some pedons. Depth to a contrasting layer of loose or nearly loose gravel and sand ranges from 25 to 40 inches. The A and B horizons range from moderately calcareous to noncalcareous but are calcareous when mixed to depth of 7 inches.  They are mildly or moderately alkaline. The A, B, and C1 horizons have hue of 10YR in most pedons, ranging to 2.5YR.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It contains 1.2 to 2.5 percent organic matter.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is dominantly loam but is gravelly loam or silt loam in some pedons."

Bock, Eaglecone and Stan soils lack a layer of loose gravel and sand above depth of 40 inches, and Stan soils are dominantly moderately coarse textured. Cokel and Holden soils have mean annual soil temperatures warmer than 47 degrees F. McCammon soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Packham and Paesl soils lack calcic horizons, and the Packham soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Presto soils have loamy sand over silt loam or medium textures above depth of 40 inches. Sasser soils are moderately coarse textured in the upper part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans at elevations of 4,200 to 5,900 feet. Slopes range from 0 to about 10 percent. The soils formed mostly in medium-textured alluvium over gravel and sand. The alluvium is dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources but contain some rhyolitic, basaltic, and granitic materials. In places, the upper part may be eolian sediments. The climate is semiarid, with dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees to 46 degrees F. Average frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
