  "OVERVIEW": "The Borvant series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and igneous rock. Borvant soils are on fan remnants, hills, and ridges on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
