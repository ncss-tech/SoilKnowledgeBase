  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Berrycreek soils are on mountains. They typically are on backslope and shoulder positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,380 to 3,300 meters. The climate is subhumid, continental with cold, snowy winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 millimeters, most of which comes in the form of snow. These soils receive additional moisture in the form of wind blown snow making it much wetter than the precipitation zone would indicate. Mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."
