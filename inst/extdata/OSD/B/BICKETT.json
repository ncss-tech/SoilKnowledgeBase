  "OVERVIEW": "The Bickett series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils\nthat formed in material derived from herbaceous plants over alluvium.\nPermeability is moderately slow.  These soils are on flood plains and\nhave slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about\n14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
