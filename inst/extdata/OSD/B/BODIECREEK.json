Bigbutte soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and have an ustic moisture regime.  Brownsbowl soils average 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, do not have fluvial stratification and buried A horizons, and do not have endosaturation and aquic conditions within the series control section.  Cadero soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.Greengrove soils intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. Hallet soils have aquic conditions at 50 to 100 cm. Medrick and Pannfield soils have a ustic soil moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bodiecreek soils are on low stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed metamorphic and igneous rocks and volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 2,286 to 2,438 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
