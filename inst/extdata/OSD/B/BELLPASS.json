  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellpass series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in moderately thick herbaceous organic materials overlying fluid clayey sediments in saline coastal marshes.  Slopes range from 0 to 0.2 percent.  These soils are flooded very frequently by saltwater during high tides.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic soil material ranges from 16 to 51 inches. The organic material is dominantly from herbaceous plants. Reaction of the organic layers ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and reaction of the mineral layers ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  In drained pedons the reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral throughout.  The organic layers are dominantly sapric material but some pedons have layers, particularly surface layers, that are hemic or fibric materials, but their accumulative thickness is less than one-half the total thickness of the organic horizons.  Salinity is high or very high and the conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 8 to more than 16 dS/m in the upper 40 inches.\nThe O layers have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less. Mineral content averages 40 to 70 percent.\nThe Ag horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is mucky clay or clay.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5G or neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or less.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  The n-value ranges from 0.7 to more than 1.0."
