  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic soil material ranges from 16 to 51 inches. The organic material is dominantly from herbaceous plants. Reaction of the organic layers ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and reaction of the mineral layers ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  In drained pedons the reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral throughout.  The organic layers are dominantly sapric material but some pedons have layers, particularly surface layers, that are hemic or fibric materials, but their accumulative thickness is less than one-half the total thickness of the organic horizons.  Salinity is high or very high and the conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 8 to more than 16 dS/m in the upper 40 inches.\nThe O layers have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less. Mineral content averages 40 to 70 percent.\nThe Ag horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is mucky clay or clay.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5G or neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or less.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  The n-value ranges from 0.7 to more than 1.0."

Allemands soils have salinity content of less than 4 dS/m in the control section.  Bessie soils have EC, or salinity, of more than 16 dS/m in the upper part. Clovelly soils have salinity less than 8 dS/m.  Belhaven, Dare, Dorovan, Ponzer, Pungo, and Tomoka soils are more acid.  Carlin, Kenner, Lafitte, and Maurepas soils have more than 51 inches of organic materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They flood very frequently and frequently with salt water during high tides.  Slopes range from 0 to 0.2 percent.  Near the type location the average annual rainfall is about 67 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F."

The vegetation at the type location is smooth cordgrass and small amounts of seashore saltgrass.  Other plant species include marshhay cordgrass, needlegrass rush, bushy sea-oxeye, saltwort, and saltmarsh aster."
