These soils formed in stratified mixed alluvium with some strata having large quantities of gravel and cobbles and other strata having smaller amounts.  Elevation is 700 to 2,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free period is 250 to 300 days."
