  "OVERVIEW": "The Brecken series consists of very deep, well drained soils on dissected terraces.  These soils formed mainly from weakly consolidated mixed alluvium.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
