Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, Btg1, Btg2 and Btg3 horizons and from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the Btg4 horizon.  There are none to many nodules of calcium carbonate and shell fragments in the Btg horizons.  Flakes of mica range from none to common.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam or the mucky analogues.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 3 through 7.  Mottles may occur in shades of red, brown, yellow, gray and olive.  Texture is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay.  The clay content of the particle size control section is 35 to 55 percent and contains more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  The lower part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 through 7; or the lowest part is reticulately mottled in shades of gray, green, yellow, brown and red.  It is clay, sandy clay or sandy clay loam, and includes thin strata of loam.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Btg horizon, or is reticulately mottled in the same colors as the lower Btg horizon.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, is mottled in same colors as the horizon above.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam or loamy sand; or it is stratified sandy or loamy sediments.  Nodules of calcium carbonate and shell fragments range from few to many."

Bayboro, Byars, Cape Fear, Ellabelle and Surrency soils have base saturation less than 35 percent; in addition, Ellabelle and Surrency soils have thick sandy A horizons.  Stockade soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control sections.  Fellowship and Martel soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 72 degrees F, or more.  Samba soils formed in silty alluvium on stream terraces and have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the control section.  Wadmalaw soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section and umbric epipedon is less than 10 inches thick."
