  "OVERVIEW": "The Bijou series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in thick noncalcareous coarse to moderately coarse textured materials derived from granite or arkose deposits.  Bijou soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, valley side slopes, and sandy uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.)",
