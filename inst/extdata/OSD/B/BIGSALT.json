  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigsalt series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These nearly level soils are on flood plains and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
