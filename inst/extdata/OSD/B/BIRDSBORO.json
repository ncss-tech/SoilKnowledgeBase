  "STATES": "MD,NJ,PA,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Birdsboro series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately well drained soils. The soils formed in old alluvial deposits derived from red sandstone, shale, and siltstone. They are on terraces and alluvial fans with convex slopes of 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high. Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",

Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the solum and from 0 to 70 percent in the C horizon. Reaction throughout the soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry value is more than 5. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Hue of 7.5YR is restricted to the lower part of the solum. Fine-earth textures are loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine through coarse blocky or subangular blocky.

Chilmark soils formed in a loamy or sandy aeolian mantle over fine or moderately fine coastal plain sediments. Hassler soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum weathered from acid igneous rocks, primarily granite. Roselle soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from coarse grained, acid igneous rocks, primarily granite. Thurmont soils formed in alluvial and colluvial materials on footslopes, colluvial fans, benches, and stream terraces. Tulip soils formed in colluvium from sandstone and siltstone and the underlying paleosol in residuum from shale.\nAlbemarle, Allegheny, Allenwood, Arcola, Arendtsville, Aura, Bedington, Bucks, Butano, Chester, Chetwynd, Chili, Clymer, Collington, Cowee, Hackers, Edgemont, Edneytown, Elsinboro, Eubanks, Frankstown, Freehold, Gilpin, Glenelg, Leck Kill, Matapeake, Meadowville, Murrill, Nixon, Pineville, Quakertown, Rawson, Rayne, Shelocta, Shouns, Syenite, Tate, Ungers, and Whiteford soils are in other  related families or subgroups. Albemarle soils have rock fragments dominated by quartz, quartzite or weathered arkose sandstone. Allegheny, Clymer, Edgemont, Frankstown, Meadowville, Quakertown, Rayne and Shelocta soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout the B horizon. Allenwood soils formed in glacial till and rock fragments are subrounded. Arcola soils formed in materials that weathered from Triassic and Jurassic interbedded siltstone, fine grained sandstone, and conglomerate in the Culpeper Basin of the northern part of the Piedmont Plateau. Arendtsville soils formed in materials weathered from a fanglomerate of quartzite, sandstone, aporhyolite, and other rocks held together in a red sandy matrix. Aura, Chetwynd, Murrill and Shouns soils have sola thicker than 48 inches. Bedington soils have channery rock fragments of gray or olive shale. Bucks and Leck Kill soils formed in residuum from red shale and have channery rock fragments. Butano, Gilpin and Syenite soils have bedrock at depths less than 40 inches. Chester and Elsinboro soils contain mica, particularly in the lower part of the solum and C horizon. Chili, Hackers and Rawson have more than 35 percent base saturation, Cowee soils have fragments of granite,gneiss or schist. Collington and Freehold soils have moderate quantities of glauconite. Edneytown soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from felsic to mafic, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks.  Eubanks soils have rock fragments of angular quartz and weathered granodiorite. Glenelg soils have sola less than 30 inches thick. Matapeake soils have a silt mantle over unconsolidated sandy coastal plain materials. Nixon soils have rock fragments dominated by quartzite cobbles. Pineville soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and siltstone. Tate soils formed in colluvium weathered from felsic to mafic high-grade metamorphic rocks. Ungers soils have channery rock fragments of quartzite, sandstone and shale. Whiteford soils have channery rock fragments of slate."
