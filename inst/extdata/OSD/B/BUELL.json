  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The umbric epipedon is more than 20 inches thick and has base saturation of less than 50 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 54 degrees F. at 20 inches depth. The soils are usually moist and are dry less than 90 cumulative days in some subhorizon. The A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and 1 through 3 moist. It has weak or very weak fine granular or subangular blocky structure. The B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam to loam containing 50 to 80 percent angular gravel and cobble, mostly of sandstone and quartzite. This horizon has weak fine to coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to very fine subangular blocks. It is medium or strongly acid."

Broad Canyon soils have mollic epipedons with base saturation of more than 50 percent that are less than 20 inches thick. Daybell, Hailman, and Poleline soils have thick mollic epipedons, and the base saturation is about 60 percent or more. Daybell soils have too few fines to fill the voids 1 mm. or larger. Goodlow soils have umbic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Hailman soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Hummington soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Lake Janee soils lack umbric horizons and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Buell soils are on steep to very steep and strongly sloping mountain slopes and strongly sloping alluvial fans at elevations of 8,200 to 8,800 feet. They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from quartzite and some sandstone parent rocks. The climate is humid with about 25 to 35 inches of precipitation, falling mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 56 degrees F. Frost-free period is about 50 to 70 days."
