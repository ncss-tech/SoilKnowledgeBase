  "OVERVIEW": "The Brems series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in acid sandy outwash and glaciolacustrine deposits on outwash plains, nearshore zones, glacial deltas, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 720 mm , and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Altmar soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments as a weighted average in the particle size control section. Birchwood soils have a dense substratum. Fortress soils contain human transported materials. In addition the Deerfield soils have rock fragments dominated by granite, gneiss and quartzite.  The Partridge soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Succotash soils are formed in marine sediments."
