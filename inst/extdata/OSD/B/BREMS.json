The Algansee, Brockatonorton, Deerfield, Elnora, Livonia, Meckling, Morocco, Ottokee, Tedrow and Zaborosky soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments as a weighted average in the particle size control section, the zone from 25 to 100 cm. Altmar soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments as a weighted average in the particle size control section. Birchwood soils have a dense substratum. Fortress soils contain human transported materials. In addition the Deerfield soils have rock fragments dominated by granite, gneiss and quartzite.  The Partridge soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Succotash soils are formed in marine sediments."

Morocco soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly lower landform positions. The well drained Osolo soils and the excessively drained Plainfield and Tyner soils are on higher positions."

This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable textures.\nA dense substratum phase is recognized.\nA loamy substratum phase is recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization for the typical pedon and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
