  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at the lithic contact ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry but are moist in some part between depth of 8 inches and the bedrock for about 60 to 80 days in the spring.  The organic matter content of the upper 15 inches, or to the bedrock if shallower, as a weighted average, is more than 0.7 percent if the weighted average sand/clay ratio for this depth is 6.  The control section is dominantly moderately coarse textured and contains less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Basalt bedrock is at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  The A horizon has value of 5 to 6.5 dry and 3 to 4.5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous.  The B horizon has value of 5.5 to 6.5 dry and 3.5 to 4.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak or very weak, subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous.  The Cca horizon is slightly lighter or paler than the B.  It is moderately calcareous (less than 15 percent lime) but may be strongly calcareous (more than 15 percent lime) in a few (less than 6) inches immediately above the bedrock."

Arrow soils are noncalcareous and neutral in the sola.  Malm and Matheson soils have no bedrock above depth of 20 inches.  Mellenthin soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and have a calcic horizon.  Mike soils have a mollic epipedon, a calcic horizon, and a medium textured control section.  Nevoyer, Prosser, Slayton, Starbuck, and Trevino soils have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.  Tenno soils are dominantly medium textured.  Arron soils are neutral throughout and overlie volcanic tuff.  Mullyou soils lack a calcic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The soils are on level to rolling basalt plains at elevations of 4,500 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in eolian material and residuum over basalt bedrock.  The climate is semiarid and has dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 2 to 4 feet of snowfall.  Average freeze-free period is 80 to 126 days."
