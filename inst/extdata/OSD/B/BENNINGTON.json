The well drained Alexandria and Amanda soils are on gently sloping to steep ridges and side slopes along drainageways. The moderately well drained Cardington and Centerburg soils are on summits, shoulders, and back slopes. The very poorly drained Condit soils are in depressions. The very poorly drained Pewamo soils have mollic epipedons and are in depressions."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Existing data on clay mineralogy is not conclusive. Areas of Bennington soils in MLRA 99 will be evaluated for a new series during modernization projects. Bennington soils were mapped on lake plain physiography in Sandusky, Huron, and Erie counties.\nThe area of the present type location is undergoing urbanization. A new pedon and location will need to be selected in the near future.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap, BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 74 cm (Btg, Bt horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons between a depth of 20 and 137 cm.\nA bedrock substratum phase is recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available for a pedon near DL-16, the typical pedon, and for pedons DL-21, ER-31, FR-43, FR-55, HU-10, HU-12, HU-16, LC-23, and MD-20 from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
