Bennington soils were mapped on lake plain physiography in Sandusky, Huron, and Erie counties.\nThe area of the present type location is undergoing urbanization. A new pedon and location will need to be selected in the near future.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap, BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 74 cm (Btg, Bt horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons between a depth of 20 and 137 cm.\nA bedrock substratum phase is recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available for a pedon near DL-16, the typical pedon, and for pedons DL-21, ER-31, FR-43, FR-55, HU-10, HU-12, HU-16, LC-23, and MD-20 from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
