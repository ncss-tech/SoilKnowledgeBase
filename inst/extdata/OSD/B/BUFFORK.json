Coarse fragments of sandstone range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sandy clay loam averaging 20 to 35 percent clay and has more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.

Amsden, and Inchau soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the control section. Anvic, Bear Basin Coldspring, Croftshaw, Croydon, Gebson, Hourglass, Kittredge, Leavitt, Lyonman, Michelson, Monad, Morset, Swede, Tingey, and Youga soils lack bedrock above depths of 40 inches. In addition Anvic and Bear Basin soils have a glossic horizon. Dra, Kezar, Lucky, Miracle, Mult, Newlands, Pirmeaux, Rammel, Shotgun, Slacks, and Woosley soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Cific, Gelkie, Lymanson, Oro Fino, Passcreek, Philipsburg, Rainbolt, Tingey, and Wellsville soils have continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate. Tripit soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Troutdale soils formed in material from micaceous schist and have mica flakes of sufficient size and quantity to affect the physical properties of the soil."
