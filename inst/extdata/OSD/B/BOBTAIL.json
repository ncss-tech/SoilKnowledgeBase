  "OVERVIEW": "The Bobtail series consists of well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in moderately thin coarse and moderately coarse textured parent material derived from gneiss and schist.  Bobtail soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.\nTypically, Bobtail soils have light brownish gray very friable platy very strongly acid A2 horizons, brown strongly acid gravelly coarse sandy loam B2 horizons, and grayish brown medium acid gravelly coarse sandy loam C horizons over hard bedrock at a depth of 30 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thin dark colored A1 horizons overlie the albic horizons in some pedons.  The soils are noncalcareous throughout with acidity decreasing with increasing depth.  Base saturation ranges from 30 to 100 percent with some but not all subhorizons above 30 inches being less than 60 percent base saturated.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  The upper part of the control section is typically gravelly coarse sandy loam and the lower part is gravelly coarse sandy loam or gravelly loamy coarse sand.  On a weighted average basis the control section is coarse-loamy with the clay ranging from 4 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 50 to 82 percent with 15 to 75 percent of the sand fraction being medium, coarse, and very coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  A majority of subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Mottling above a depth of 30 inches ranges from no mottling to a few faint mottles with the chroma of both matrix and mottles exceeding 2.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section at some period of most years.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is strongly or very strongly acid (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5 YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma from 1 through 6.  It ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid (15 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from neutral to strongly acid (1:65 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Azwell, Hanks, Jenkins, Jughandle, Lake Janee, Ligget, Ryorp, Sambrito, and Walters series.  Azwell soils lack a continuous A2 horizon and are in areas of high winter rainfall.  Hanks, Lake Janee, Ligget, Sambrito, and Walters soils lack a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Jenkins soils have only minor amounts of coarse and very coarse sand in the sand fraction.  (See Remarks.) Jughandle soils lack continuous A2 horizons and have clayey lamellae below the B2ir horizon.  Ryorp soils are slightly to medium acid and are more than 60 percent base saturated in all subhorizons above a depth of 30 inches."

The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010."
