  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Binghampton soils are on nearly level low lying parts of gently undulating till plains that have thin deposits of loamy over sandy sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in 46 to 89 cm (18 to 35 inches) of loamy eolian sediments, 33 to 76 cm (13 to 30 inches) of water-sorted sandy sediments, and in the underlying till that contains a paleosol. The till is believed to be of Illinoisan age with a late Sangamon paleosol formed in it. In some places the paleosol was partially truncated or eroded prior to deposition of the sandy and loamy sediments. The truncation of the paleosol and the origin of the sandy sediments is believed to be the result of glacial melt waters from the nearby Shelbyville morainic system or the Bloomington morainic system. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 940 mm (35 to 37 inches), mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.6 degrees C (46 to 51 degrees F), and frost free period ranges from 140 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dakota, Nachusa, Prairieville, Sparta, and Vanpetten soils. The well drained Dakota soils are on slightly higher dune-shaped ridges. Nachusa, Prairieville, Sparta, and Vanpetten soils have mollic epipedons. In addition, the somewhat poorly drained Nachusa soils are on similar nearby positions as Binghampton soils but do not have coarse textured horizons in the lower part of the control section. The moderately well drained Prairieville soils are on slightly higher positions than Binghampton soils and do not have coarse textured horizons in the lower part of the control section. The excessively drained Sparta soils are sandy throughout the solum and are on higher dune-shaped ridges. The moderately well drained Vanpetten soils are upslope from Binghampton soils and do not have an argillic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Commonly, water is perched above the paleosolic horizon during part or all of the period from November to June in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy sediments, very high (141.14 to 705.00 micrometers per second) in the sandy sediments, and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the paleosolic horizons. Permeability is moderate in the loamy sediments, very rapid in the sandy sediments, and moderately slow in the paleosolic horizons. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low."
