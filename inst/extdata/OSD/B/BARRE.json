  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of coarse fragments ranges from none to 5 percent in the solum and from 5 to 30 percent in the IIC horizon. The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and is slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the IIC horizon.  In some pedons the lower Bt horizon is calcareous.\nThe Ap horizon has hues of 5YR through 2.5Y, values of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It ranges from very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam.\nThe B2tg horizons have hues of 2.5YR to 5Y, values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 through 4.  Faces of peds have chroma of 0, 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from heavy silty clay loam to clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  They have prismatic or blocky structure parting to blocky.  Clay films range from patchy to continuous on both horizontal and vertical faces of peds.\nThe IIC horizon has hues of 2.5YR to 5Y, values of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or silt loam.  It has weak or moderate platy structure or the horizon to massive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beecher, Frankfort and Lakemont series in the same family.  Beecher soils are silty clay loam or clay loam in the lower part of the series control section.  Frankfort soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in the B2 and B3 horizons and are silty clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Lakemont soils lack a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section.\nThe Canadice, Canadea, Churchville, Fonda, Madalin and Rhinebeck series are similar soils in related families.  All except Churchville soils lack a lithologic discontinuity in the series control section.  Churchville soils have surface horizons with dry color value of 6 or more."

Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in a mantle of fine and moderately fine textures lacustrine materials and underlying medium textured glacial till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 42 inches.  The average growing season ranges from 149 to 190 days."
