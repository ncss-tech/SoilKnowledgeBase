  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent hard sandstone fragments, 5 to 10 percent soft sandstone fragments, and 5 to 15 percent clay. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry or moist.  Texture is very gravelly loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cox, Rufus, Swakane, Teamont, and Witzel series.  Cox soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Rufus soils lack a Bw horizon and have 35 to 80 percent shaly rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Swakane and Teamont soils lack a Bw horizon and are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  Witzel soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and are silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine- earth fraction of the Bw horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brisky soils are on mountainsides and ridgetops with southerly aspects and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from sandstone, mixed with volcanic ash and loess.  Elevations are 1,500 to 4,100 feet.  These soils are in climate with warm dry summers and cool winters.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 32 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 110 to 130 days.  Growing season at 28 degrees F is 140 to 180 days."
