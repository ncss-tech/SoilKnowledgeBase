Terbies soils are dry for 45 to 60 days in the soil moisture control section  and have 40 to 80 percent hard angular sandstone fragments in the particle-size control section.  Farber soils are  dry 45 to 60 days in the soil moisture control section. Hartless soils have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, are dry more than 75 consecutive days and are strongly arid or very strongly arid throughout the particle-size control section.  Kanid soils are more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Kindig soils are dry for 80 to 100 days in the soil moisture control section and have a hard Bt horizon."
