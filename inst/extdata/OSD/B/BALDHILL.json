These soils are usually moist but are  dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 49 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section  averages 2 to l0 percent clay by weight and averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments by volume including  l0 to 25 percent stone size fragments, 20 to 45 percent pebbles and 0 to l5 percent cobble size fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR and 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2  through 4 moist or dry.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 through  6 moist or dry.  Texture is very stony sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid in the upper part and neutral through moderately acid in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 8 moist or dry.  Texture is very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand or very cobbly loamy sand. It is slightly acid or neutral."

Beekman, Beausite, Brew, Inskip, Longoe, Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron, and Vena soils have a lithic contact  within a depth of 40 inches.  Atring, Clallam and Straight soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Terbies soils are dry for 45 to 60 days in the soil moisture control section  and have 40 to 80 percent hard angular sandstone fragments in the particle-size control section.  Farber soils are  dry 45 to 60 days in the soil moisture control section. Hartless soils have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, are dry more than 75 consecutive days and are strongly arid or very strongly arid throughout the particle-size control section.  Kanid soils are more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Kindig soils are dry for 80 to 100 days in the soil moisture control section and have a hard Bt horizon."

These soils are in a maritime climate of cool dry summers and mild wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches most of which falls between October and April.  Average January temperature is 36 degrees F., the average July temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from l60  to 2l0 days."
