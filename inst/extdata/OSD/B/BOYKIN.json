  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the Bt ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  CEC ranges from about 10 to 20 me/100 gm.\nThe A horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bt horizons are fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through medium acid.  The Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 5, and chroma of 6 through 8.  Mottles range from few to common in shades of brown, red, and yellow.  A few plinthite nodules occur in the lower solum of some pedons but constitutes less than 5 percent of any horizon.  Some pedons have skeletans with chroma of 2 or 3 in the lower Bt horizon."

Autryville, Bonneau, Letney, and Wagram soils have hue of 7.5YR and yellower in the Bt horizon.  Autryville soils also have bisequal profiles.  Briley soils are developed in Eocene age materials and are assumed to have different chemistry and kinds of clays.  Lowndes soils contain hard white phosphatic nodules in the profile.  Lucy soils contain slightly less silt, are dry in the moisture control section for shorter periods of time, and have clays with lower CEC in the control section.  Rosalie soils have skeletans of uncoated sand in the upper Bt horizons.  Trep soils have hue of 10YR in the Bt horizon and have clayey lower Bt horizons.  Darco and Shankler soils have sandy epipedons greater than 40 inches thick.  Lilbert and Doucette soils contain contain 5 to 20 percent plinthite in the Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boykin soils are on broad, nearly level to moderately steep uplands of the West Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy sediments of Pleistocene age, mainly of the Willis formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches.  Summer rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches.   Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 72."

Bonwier, Newco, and Stringtown soils are on convex side slopes, and steep narrow ridges.  Doucette, Pinetucky, Rogan, and Urland soils are on smoother and flatter slopes usually slightly lower in the landscape.  Pinetucky, Rogan, and Urland soils lack sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Shankler soils are on associated concave positions and lower slope positions.  They all lack thick sandy epipedons."
