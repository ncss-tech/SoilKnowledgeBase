Jacoby soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than 10 inches thick and average annual soil temperatures warmer than 43 degrees F.  Kearl soils formed in materials weathered dominantly from limestone and have hues of 7.5YR through 2.5YR in the B and C horizons."

Jacoby soils have average annual soil temperatures greater than 43 degrees F.  The Jipper soil is pachic and is deeper than 40 inches.  Nayrib soils are very shallow to bedrock and have more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Wolverine soils are very deep and lack B horizons.  Snowshoe soils lack a mollic epipedon and are noneffervescent throughout.  Stipe soils lack a calcic horizon.  Jacoby, Jipper, and Stipe soils are on adjacent side slopes and swales.  Nayrib soils are on pressure ridges and blowouts.  Wolverine and Snowshoe soils are on stabilized dunes."
