  "OVERVIEW": "The Bergsvik series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in partially decomposed herbaceous plant materials by sand.  Bergsvik soils are in depressional areas between coastal dunes and adjacent uplands. The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated with water throughout the year unless artificially drained. The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. The mean annual summer soil temperature is about 52 to 56 degrees F., and the mean annual winter soil temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. Depth to the underlying sandy material is 18 to 51 inches. These soils are extremely to very strongly acid in the organic layers.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1, 2 or 3 moist. Fibers range from 35 percent to 85 percent unrubbed and 15 to 40 percent after rubbing. A surface mantle of sand 3 to 12 inches thick overlies the organic materials in some areas.\nThe subsurface tier has hue of 5YR ot 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1, 2 or 3 moist. Fibers range from 40 to 80 percent unrubbed ans 20 to 50 percent after rubbing. Mineral material ranges from 0 to 45 percent in the lower part.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry."

They formed in the remains of sedges, willows and other water tolerant plants deposited over interdunal sands. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 175 to 220 days."
