  "OVERVIEW": "The Bethel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on upland terraces.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy alluvium or aeolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils occur on concave interdunal areas of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A).  Depth to a water table ranges from 24 to about 40 inches from October through May.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 33 inches.",
