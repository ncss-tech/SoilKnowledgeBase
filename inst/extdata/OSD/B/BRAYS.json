  "OVERVIEW": "The Brays series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over colluvium from granitic bedrock. They are on scarp slopes of plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for one-half to three-forths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 9 to 13 inches thick. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc. It has 5 to 15 percent ash 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, 0 to 5 percent pumice 2 to 5 mm. in diameter. Glass content is 30 to 50 percent. Acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron is 0.15 to 0.40 percent. The upper part of the particle-size control section has 5 to 10 percent rock fragments, the lower part has 50 to 65 percent rock fragments. The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Field estimated clay content is 4 to 10 percent. Depth to granitic rock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A and AB horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 to 4 moist. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw2 horizon has value 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is very or extremely cobbly ashy fine sandy loam."
