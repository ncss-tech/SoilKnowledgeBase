    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for one-half to three-forths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 9 to 13 inches thick. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc. It has 5 to 15 percent ash 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, 0 to 5 percent pumice 2 to 5 mm. in diameter. Glass content is 30 to 50 percent. Acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron is 0.15 to 0.40 percent. The upper part of the particle-size control section has 5 to 10 percent rock fragments, the lower part has 50 to 65 percent rock fragments. The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Field estimated clay content is 4 to 10 percent. Depth to granitic rock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A and AB horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 to 4 moist. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw2 horizon has value 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is very or extremely cobbly ashy fine sandy loam."

Bitner soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and have 50 to 90 percent glass. Chelan, Delrio, Dryhollow, Emagert, Weezweed and Yellowhills soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock. Deskamp soils lack a cambic horizon. Kester soils are slightly to strongly alkaline, are underlain by basalt and have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Winblow soils are underlain by basalt and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brays soils are on scarp slopes of plateaus. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Brays soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over colluvium from granitic bedrock. Elevation is 1,200 to 1,800 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F.; and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."
