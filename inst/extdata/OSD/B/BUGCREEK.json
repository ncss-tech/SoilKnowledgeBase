These soils do not show the normal reduced matrix colors typically associated with saturation and reducing conditions, however, field documentation verified saturation and aquic conditions;\nisotic mineralogy based on 1500 kPa water to measured clay ratio of 0.6 or greater.\nOn referring to the upper parent material as drift\": The deposits in the mantle of Bugcreek soils representative site's inter-drumlin landscape position mimic the deposits in the mantle of the drumlin uplands. The glacial history and field observations support a basal dense lodgment till overlain by ablation till or drift. Evidence of sorting and stratification is not sufficient to characterize the deposits as glaciofluvial.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006"
