  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluewater series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Bluewater soils are on valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
