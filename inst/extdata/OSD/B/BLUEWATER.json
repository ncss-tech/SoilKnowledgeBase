The Albinas, Garret, Haxtun, Keya, Ownyate, Renner, Sampson, Tracylee, Vosburg, Wetterdon, and Woodly soils do not have redoximorphic features and an apparent water table within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Farnum and Funmar soils have warmer mean annual soil temperatures.  Jarita soils are moderately deep.  Prosper soils have redox depletions within 40 inches of the soil surface and an intermittent water table.  In addition, the Albinas, Farnum, Funmar, Garret, Haxtun, Keya, Prosper, Renner, Sampson, Tracylee, and Wetterdon soils are in LRR-G and are moist in May and June."
