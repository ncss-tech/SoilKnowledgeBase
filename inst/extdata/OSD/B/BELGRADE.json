  "OVERVIEW": "The Belgrade series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine material.  They are nearly level to moderately steep soils on terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately low to high in the substratum.  Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 44 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the C horizon; however, some subhorizon between depths of 10 and 30 inches is moderately acid to neutral.  Redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less are within a depth of 24 inches (60 cm).  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent to a depth of 40 inches and 0 to 30 percent below 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Undisturbed areas have an A horizon with colors and textures similar to the Ap.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have lower Bw horizons with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6, with common or many redoximorphic features. The Bw horizon is typically silt loam or very fine sandy loam but includes loamy very fine sand.  Structure is weak coarse prismatic, weak fine subangular blocky or weak or moderate, fine or medium granular, or the horizon is massive.  Consistence ranges from firm to very friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has characteristics similar to those of the lower Bw horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have thin strata of loamy fine sand, fine sand, or silt.  Below a depth of 40 inches some pedons have unconforming strata of sand or sand and gravel, or very thin strata or varves of contrasting material.  The C horizon has common to many redoximorphic features.  It is usually massive, but some pedons have platy structure.  Consistence ranges from firm to loose."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  The Bridgehampton, Boxford, Dartmouth, Enfield, Georgia, Hartland, Raynham, Scio, Suffield, Tisbury, Unadilla, and Wapping are similar soils in related families.  Boxford soils are fine.  Georgia soils are coarse-loamy.  Suffield soils are coarse-silty over clayey.  Bridgehampton, Dartmouth, Enfield, Scio, Tisbury, Unadilla, and Wapping soils have base saturation of less than 60 percent in the upper 30 inches.  In addition, Enfield and Tisbury soils have sand and gravel within a depth of 40 inches.  Hartland soils do not have redox depletions within a depth of 24 inches. Raynham soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Belgrade soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on glaciolacustrine terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  The upper part of the soil formed in water or wind deposited material high in silt and very fine sand.  The material below 40 inches is variable and ranges from gravelly sand to silt.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 47 inches.  The frost free season ranges from 135 to 195 days."
