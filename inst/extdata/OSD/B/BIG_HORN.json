  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to calcareous material ranges from 12 to 30 inches. Organic carbon in the upper 15 inches averages .6 to 1.2 percent and the sand/clay ratio ranges from less than 1 to 2. These soils have an abrupt textural boundary between the A and Bt horizons and have a thin discontinuous E horizon immediately above the Bt horizon in some pedons. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 12 percent and cobbles are 0 to 3 percent in most of the solum and increase with increasing depth. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. When the value of the A horizon is as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist the horizon is thin enough so that if the soil is mixed to 7 inches, it has an ochric epipedon. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is typically clay but ranges in clay from 35 to 50 percent with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk when present has the combined properties of the Bt and Bk horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. This horizon has 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adena, Bidman, Briggsdale, Campo, Demar, Gibbler, and Mughut series. Adena soils have solums thinner than 15 inches. Bidman and Campo soils lack a calcic horizon. Briggsdale, Gibbler, and Mughut soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Demar soils are acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Big Horn soils are on old alluvial fans and high terraces. Elevation is 3,500 to 5,500 feet. Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvial fan sediments of comparatively old age. At the  Rev. PSD 880414  type location the average annual precipitation is 12 to 19 inches and approximately 8 to 9 inches of this falls during the months of April through August. The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 68 degrees F. The frost-free season is 95 to 125 days."
