The depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 55 inches.  The substratum, below depths of 36 inches, typically is alkaline local alluvium or partially weathered soft siltstone, shale or sandstone.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam, but some is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E/B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sandy loam to silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly acid.  Some pedons have E or B/E horizons with the same properties as the E/B horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay or clay loam averaging 35 to 45 percent clay.  Clay films are faint and distinct on faces of peds. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Btkn horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have BCk or BC horizons.  Some pedons have Bky or Bkz horizons below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam or clay loam, but some are loam, clay, or silty clay.  Some pedons are fine sandy loam below 40 inches.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

None of the associated soils, except Daglum and Rhoades soils, have natric horizons.  Amor, Moreau, Morton, Regent and Sen soils are adjacent to Belfield soils on uplands.  Farland, Wyola and Shambo soils are adjacent to Belfield soils on terraces.  Grail and Lawther soils are adjacent to Belfield soils in upland swales.  Daglum and Rhoades soils occupy similar positions as Belfield soils. They have strong columnar structure.  In addition, Rhoades soils have visible salts or gypsum within a depth of 16 inches."
