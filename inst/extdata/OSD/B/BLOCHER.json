Ashburn soils have a lithic contact in the series control section. Deuchars and Stonehead, soils have a paralithic contact in the series control section. Gallipolis and Tarhollow soils do not have carbonates in the series control section. Jeneva and Percell soils average less than 25 percent sand in all subhorizons above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Westgate soils do not have rock fragments of igneous lithology."

The Bonnell and Hickory soils do not have redoximorphic depletions above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches), and are on lower lying, steeper backslopes. Cincinnati, Jennings and Nabb soils have a fragipan in the series control section. The Weddel soils have a horizon with fragic soil properties (2Btx) in the series control section. Cincinnati, Jennings and Weddel soils are on similar positions on the landform, and are often part of a complex map unit that includes Blocher soils. Nabb soils are on higher lying shoulders and summits."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series crosses both above and below the 15 percent 0.1 to 75 mm fraction size average in the particle-size control section. Additional data indicates this series is dominantly in the fine-silty rather than fine-loamy particle-size class and is revised to the fine-silty class as of 5/2000. The typical pedon averages 13.8 percent in the 0.1 to 75 mm fraction size. Lab data on two other phases average 21 and 23 percent in the 0.1 to 75 mm fraction size.\nHard bedrock substratum, soft bedrock, severely eroded and gullied phases are recognized.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 15 cm (6 inches) (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: the zone from 15 to 157 cm (6 to 62 inches) (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nRedoximorphic features: at 43 to 135 cm (17 to 53 inches); clay films with a chroma of 2 or less are iron depleted redoximorphic features.\nRepresentative component and horizon data for the Blocher Series is in the following data mapunits: DMU ID 124488 for the typical pedon; DMU ID 124480 for the soft bedrock substratum; and DMU ID 124520 for the hard bedrock substratum.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on the typical pedon S92IN143-001 is at the NSSC, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
