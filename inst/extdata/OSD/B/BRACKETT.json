  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used as rangeland. The climax plant community is a tall grass savannah with motts of live oak and Texas oak scattered throughout the landscape. The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other grasses include yellow Indiangrass, sideoats grama, tall grama, seep muhly, slim tridens, hairy grama, silver bluestem, slim tridens, tall dropseed, and perennial threeawns. Woody plants include live oak, Texas oak, kidneywood and shin oak. Forbs, such as bundleflower, sensitive briar, Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann daisy, and gayfeather, are found throughout the site. With over grazing, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of Ashe juniper, Texas persimmon, agarito, live oak, threeawns, Texas grama, hairy tridens, red grama, prairie coneflower, broomweed, and ragweed."
