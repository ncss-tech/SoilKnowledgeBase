  "OVERVIEW": "The Brackett series consists of shallow to paralithic bedrock, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone of Cretaceous age, mainly from the Glen Rose formation. These nearly level to very steep soils are located on backslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus of the Edwards Plateau. Slopes are1 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in).",

The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other grasses include yellow Indiangrass, sideoats grama, tall grama, seep muhly, slim tridens, hairy grama, silver bluestem, slim tridens, tall dropseed, and perennial threeawns. Woody plants include live oak, Texas oak, kidneywood and shin oak. Forbs, such as bundleflower, sensitive briar, Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann daisy, and gayfeather, are found throughout the site. With over grazing, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of Ashe juniper, Texas persimmon, agarito, live oak, threeawns, Texas grama, hairy tridens, red grama, prairie coneflower, broomweed, and ragweed."
