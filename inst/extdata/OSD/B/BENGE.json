  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The sola range from 15 to 24 inches thick.  The depth to the discontinuity and to lime if present is 24 to 36 inches and ranges from 24 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 9 to 14 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 50 degrees to 56 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 to 25 inches for 70 to 90 consecutive days. The upper part of the control section averages less than 10 percent rock fragments and has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It has weak granular or blocky structure and is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry. It is silt loam or loam. This horizon has weak subangular blocky or weak prismatic structure.\nThe C1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist. It is gravelly loam or gravelly silt loam. This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline. The IIC horizon is dominantly gravel with sand filling the voids larger than 1 mm."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Beckley, Cheney, Chewelah and Haley series. Beckley and Haley soils have a coarse sandy loam or fine sandy loam control section. Also, Haley soils lack rock fragments. Cheney soils have a chroma of 4 in the control section. Chewelah soils are calcareous in all parts of the solum."

The soils formed in glacial outwash materials with a mixture of loess in the upper part.  Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. Mean July temperature is 73 degrees F.; mean January temperature is 32 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 135 to 180 days."
