  "OVERVIEW": "The Bogusrim series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from volcanic rock. Bogusrim soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
