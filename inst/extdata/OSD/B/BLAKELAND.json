  "REVDATE": "10/2015",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Blakeland series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvial materials from arkose deposits. They are on uplands, often adjacent to drainageways, and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
