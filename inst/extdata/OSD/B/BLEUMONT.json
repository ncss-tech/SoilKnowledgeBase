  "OVERVIEW": "The Bleumont series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Slope is 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 53 degrees F.",
