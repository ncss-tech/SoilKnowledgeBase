Organic carbon content ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the mineral soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The A1 horizon is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Masses of iron accumulation range from few to many in shades of yellow and brown. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam. The weighted average clay content of the 10- to 40- inch control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay and contains more than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine. A stratified or massive C horizon is in some pedons. It has color and texture similar to the B horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Angelina and Kinston series in the same family and the similar Bibb, Herod, Mantachie, Nahatche, and Wehadkee series. Angelina soils are very poorly drained, are ponded for long periods of time, and are slowly permeable. Kinston soils typically have a stratified control section and are in slightly cooler temperature regimes. Bibb soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Mantachie soils have less than 60 percent of the mass between the Ap and 30 inches dominated by chroma of 2 or less and are not as wet. Herod, Nahatche, and Wehadkee soils have a pH of greater than 5.5 in some part of the control section."

Series was reclassified from a Typic to a Fluvaquentic subgroup 10/2001.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -- 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nFluventic feature -- irregular distribution of organic matter.\nAquic feature -- permanent saturation with water, and a reduced matrix in all horizons below a depth 25 cm from the mineral soil surface."
