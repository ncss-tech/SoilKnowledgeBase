  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except in the surface layer. Organic carbon content ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the mineral soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The A1 horizon is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Masses of iron accumulation range from few to many in shades of yellow and brown. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam. The weighted average clay content of the 10- to 40- inch control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay and contains more than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine. A stratified or massive C horizon is in some pedons. It has color and texture similar to the B horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Angelina and Kinston series in the same family and the similar Bibb, Herod, Mantachie, Nahatche, and Wehadkee series. Angelina soils are very poorly drained, are ponded for long periods of time, and are slowly permeable. Kinston soils typically have a stratified control section and are in slightly cooler temperature regimes. Bibb soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Mantachie soils have less than 60 percent of the mass between the Ap and 30 inches dominated by chroma of 2 or less and are not as wet. Herod, Nahatche, and Wehadkee soils have a pH of greater than 5.5 in some part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F. Frost-days range from 240 to 260. Elevation ranges 20 to 200 feet. Thornthwaite P-E Index ranges from 80 to 84."
