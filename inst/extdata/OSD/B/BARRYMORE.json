  "OVERVIEW": "The Barrymore series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and loess from mixed sources.  Barrymore soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
