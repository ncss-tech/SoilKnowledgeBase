Renshaw soils have 2C horizons that have less than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction.  Arvilla and Binford soils are sandy.  Coe soils are sandy-skeletal.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Brantford soils are on level to gently rolling outwash plains, beach ridges, eskers and terraces.  Slope gradients are mainly l to 5 percent, but ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in a mantle of loamy materials underlain by beds of glaciofluvial sand and gravel containing appreciable amounts of shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 3 to 7 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 410 to 510 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."

Fordville soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.  Sioux soils are sandy-skeletal.  Walum soils are moderately well drained.  Kensal soils are on level and slightly concave areas.
