Deecree soils average 30 to 40 percent calcium carbonate in the particle-size control section. Denay soils lack the sandy-skeletal material in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Eaglecone soils have angular rock fragments. Nirac, Rudeen and Xine soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Pamison soils have weak discontinuous silica and carbonate cementation. Wereld soils are deep to bedrock."
