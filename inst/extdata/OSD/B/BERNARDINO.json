  "OVERVIEW": "The Bernardino series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rock.  Bernardino soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
