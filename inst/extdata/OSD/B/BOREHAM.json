(Bk and 2Bk horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  Loamy-skeletal materials beginning at 42 inches, the top of the 2Bk3.\nPreviously, the concept of this soil was a fine-loamy PSCS and was included with the Avalon series. Laboratory data shows a high percentage of clay sized carbonates causing it to have a coarse-loamy PSCS.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference sample from pedon 92P107 Duchesne County, Utah 4/93 and partial reference sample from pedon 93P579 Uintah County Utah 12/93.  The cation exchange activity class was determined from laboratory data.\nTaxonomic version:  Eight Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
