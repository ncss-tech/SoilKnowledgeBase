  "OVERVIEW": "The Boreham series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium over loamy-skeletal alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Boreham soils are on fan remnants and strath terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

(Bk and 2Bk horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  Loamy-skeletal materials beginning at 42 inches, the top of the 2Bk3.\nPreviously, the concept of this soil was a fine-loamy PSCS and was included with the Avalon series. Laboratory data shows a high percentage of clay sized carbonates causing it to have a coarse-loamy PSCS.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference sample from pedon 92P107 Duchesne County, Utah 4/93 and partial reference sample from pedon 93P579 Uintah County Utah 12/93.  The cation exchange activity class was determined from laboratory data.\nTaxonomic version:  Eight Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
