It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam but is loam or clay loam in some pedons. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 2 to 5 (3 to 6 dry); and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is silty clay or clay but is silty clay loam or clay loam in some pedons. Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a Btk horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bt.\nThe Bk or BCg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 to 6 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 1 to 4. They typically are silty clay loam, silty clay or clay loam but are silt loam or loam in some pedons. The Bk horizon has common to many accumulations of carbonates. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline in the BC horizon and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the Bk horizon. Some pedons have few to common accumulations of gypsum and other salts in the lower part.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 to 7 (5 to 8 dry), and chroma of 1 to 6. It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam. In some parts, the Cg horizon has few accumulations of carbonate. Some pedons have few to common accumulations of gypsum and other salts. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has colors similar to the Cg horizon. It typically is clay loam or loam, but is sandy clay loam in some pedons. Some pedons have few accumulations of carbonate. Some pedons have few to common accumulations of gypsum and other salts. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons do not have a 2C horizon."

Badger soils are formed in alluvium or alluvium over glacial till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29 inches). Average growing season is 120 to 160 days. Average growing season precipitation ranges from 330 to 457 millimeters (13 to 18 inches). Elevation above sea level is 305 to 701 meters (1,000 to 2,300 feet). Growing degree days range from 2,500 to 3,000."

The moderately well drained Aastad, Brookings, Svea, and Waubay soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on higher parts of the landscape. The well drained Barnes, Forman, Peever, Poinsett and Vienna soils have a thinner mollic epipedon and are on higher parts of the landscape. The somewhat poorly drained Cubden, Hamerly, and McKranz soils have a calcic horizon and are on slight rises above swales and depressions. The very poorly drained Oldham soils are calcareous to the surface and are in closed depressions and basins of shallow lakes. The very poorly drained phase of Parnell soils are in closed depressions and have saturation at the surface. The poorly drained phase of Parnell are on similar landscape positions but have saturation within 30 cm (12 inches) of the surface. The poorly drained Tonka soils have an albic horizon and are in closed depressions and basins."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is .15 to .5 centimeters (.06 to .2 inches) per hour. Seasonal high saturation occurs as high as 1 foot, typically in the spring in normal years. Very brief, frequent flooding can occur where this soil occurs in drainageways."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 89 centimeters (35 inches) (Ap, Bt1, Bt2 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 23 to 89 centimeters (9 to 35 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); aquic suborder- Value of 5 or more and chroma of 2 or less and redox features that have higher chroma. Vertic subgroup based on more than 6 cm of COLE in the upper 102 centimeters (40 inches) (clay content is 35 to 50 percent in the argillic).\nIn the past this series was correlated as both poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained.  This created interpretive problems for hydric soils and overlap with the Parnell series.  The central concept of this series is somewhat poorly drained.  The poorly drained phase of Parnell is the hydric component on the landscape.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon National Soil Survey Lab number S87SD-077-016 for results of the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
