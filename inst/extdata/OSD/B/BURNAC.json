  "OVERVIEW": "The Burnac series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed from basalt, sandstone, and shale alluvium.  Burnac soils are on basalt flows and benches with slope of 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 50 cm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
