Acel soils have cracks wider than 1 centimeter at a depth of 20 inches.  Bario and Iles soils have calcic horizons.  Echolake, Dandrea and Silesca soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at 20 to 40 inches.  Loghill soils do not have E horizons. Siesta soils have cinders in the lower part of the Bt.  Spud soils have argillic horizons with the base more than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Burnac soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep, convex basalt flows where elevations range from 7,000 to 11,000 feet.  The soils formed in stony, fine textured alluvium weathered from basalt, sandstone and shale.  The climate is continental with average temperature estimated at 41 degrees F. to 45 degrees F. and average summer temperatures estimated at 47 degrees F.  The annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 23 inches of which about 60 percent falls during the frost-free period.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Frost free period is 70 to 100 days."
