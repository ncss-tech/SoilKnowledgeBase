  "OVERVIEW": "The Burnac series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed from basalt, sandstone, and shale alluvium.  Burnac soils are on basalt flows and benches with slope of 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The soils formed in stony, fine textured alluvium weathered from basalt, sandstone and shale.  The climate is continental with average temperature estimated at 41 degrees F. to 45 degrees F. and average summer temperatures estimated at 47 degrees F.  The annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 23 inches of which about 60 percent falls during the frost-free period.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Frost free period is 70 to 100 days."
