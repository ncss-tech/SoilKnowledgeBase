Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches (205 to 307 mm), and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F (7 to 11 degrees C). The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Annabella, Braffits and Sevy soils. Annabella soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on fan terraces upslope from the Bandag soils. Braffits soils occur on alluvial fans on elevations below the Bandag soils. The Sevy soils have an argillic horizon and occur on convex slopes of fan terraces where Bandag soils occur in drainageways."

In Utah this series is correlated with semi-desert range sites."
