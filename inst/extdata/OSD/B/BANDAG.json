  "REVDATE": "10/2014",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bandag series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Bandag soils are on fan skirts, toeslopes of alluvial fans and alluvial flats and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. (10 degrees C), and the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches (256 mm).",

The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches (205 to 307 mm), and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F (7 to 11 degrees C). The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Braffits soils occur on alluvial fans on elevations below the Bandag soils. The Sevy soils have an argillic horizon and occur on convex slopes of fan terraces where Bandag soils occur in drainageways."
