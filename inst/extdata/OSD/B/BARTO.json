Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  The till is 20 to 51 cm in thickness and overlies basalt, granite or gabbro bedrock. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 cm. Annual frost-free days range from 80 to 140 . The elevation above sea level ranges from 200 to 600 meters."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  On the Highland moraine, these are the Ahmeek, Canosia, Giese, Greysolon, Hermantown, Mesaba, and Normanna soils.  The well drained Ahmeek soils occur on shoulders and sideslopes.  The poorly drained Canosia soils occur on toeslopes, flats and in slight depressions. The very poorly drained Giese soils occur in depressions and swales.  The moderately well drained Greysolon soils are on bedrock controlled areas, are typically less sloping or less convex than Barto soils and have saturation above a depth of 102 cm.  The somewhat poorly drained Hermantown soils occur on footlsopes, flats and slight rises on flats.  The well drained Mesaba are on similar landscape but have bedrock at 51 to 102 cm in the profile.  The moderately well drained Normanna soils occur on summits and sideslopes.\nOn the Toimi drumlin field these are the Brimson, Nevens and Toimi soils. The somewhat poorly drained Brimson soils occur on footslopes, summit flats and some backslopes and shoulders.  The poorly drained Nevens soils occur on flats and toeslopes.  The moderately well drained Toimi soils occur on shoulders, summits and sideslopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: ochric horizon - from the surface to a depth of 5 cm (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 5 cm to 33 cm (Bw horizon); great group class based on base saturation above 60 percent in a layer between 25 and 75 cm from the soil surface.\nThe initial review draft (DHP-HRF, 6/70) of this series had a placement of Lithic Haplorthods. Subsequent laboratory analyses indicate that the upper part of the B horizon of these soils meet all of the requirements for a spodic horizon except for item 3.a. of chapter 3, page 32 of Soil Taxonomy. However, this series is challenged for Haplorthods because the B horizon is marginal to a spodic horizon. For clarity, a new type location was chosen.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station Central File Code No. 572 for results and some laboratory analysis of the typical pedon and to No. 592 and 909 for results of analyses of two additional pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
