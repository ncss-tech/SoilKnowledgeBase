  "OVERVIEW": "The Bothwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments and silty alluvium influenced by loess.  They are on lake terraces, fan terraces, and hillsides. Permeability is moderately slow.  Bothwell soils have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
