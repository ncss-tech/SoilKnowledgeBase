  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock are more than 6 feet.  Fragments of chert, sandstone, geodes and quartzite pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and Bt horizons and from 0 to 25 percent in the 2Bt horizon. The soil is moderately acid to very strongly acid in the A and Bt horizons and strongly acid or very strongly acid in the 2Bt horizon.  The surface layer is less acid where limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Severly eroded areas also have hue of 5YR and chroma of 6.\nSome pedons have a thin BA horizon that have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is silt loam.\nThe upper Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe lower Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of red, yellow or brown in some pedons.  It is silty clay loam or rarely silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of red, yellow or browm and in the lower part of some pedons gray.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe control section averages between 25 and 35 percent clay and from 5 to 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  A lithologic discontinuity is not evident in all pedons and is not a requirement of the series."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bewleyville soils are on undulating to hilly uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. They formed in a silty mantle 2 to 3.5 feet in thickness and the underlying material.  The underlying material is either old alluvium or residuum from limestone.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 51 inches."

Dickson soils, on slightly higher landscapes on more level ridgetops, and the Guthrie and Taft soils on lower lying areas have fragipans.  Waynesboro soils, on slightly lower lying landscapes have a clayey control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In recent years,The Bewleyville soils have been classified in the Pickwick series in Tennessee.  This series was placed on the inactive list about 1960. The type location had been moved to Kentucky some time before that.  The series was reactivated in 1974 with the type location in White County, Tennessee.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Grain counts by the Beltsville Soil Survey Laboratory show only traces of weatherable minerals in the Bt horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 8 to 72 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 28 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
