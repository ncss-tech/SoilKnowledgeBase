  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The clay content of the control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Base saturation at 50 inches below top of Bt ranges from 5 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 3 and 4, chroma of 1 through 3. The E horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, chromas 3 and 4. The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, and loamy fine sand. Reaction is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR and 5YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 4 through 8. Mottles range from none to common with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, chroma of 1 through 8. These mottles are concentrated in the lower part. The texture is clay or sandy clay. Gray shale fragments range from none to common. Some pedons have 7.5YR hue in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Strata of sandy clay loam occurs in\nplaces. The Bt horizon contains 1 to 10 percent by volume of angular ironstone fragments. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe B/C or BC horizon has reddish brown or yellowish colors and is stratified or mottled with these and grayish colors. The degree of weathering is variable and some pedons have BC horizons with only a few visible parent material fragments. It is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam with or without weathered sandstone and shaly materials. Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon is stratified beds of clay, soft weathered shale, and sandy materials with colors of gray, brown, and red. Flakes of mica occur along cleavage planes between stratas in some pedons. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Albertville, Badin, Bengal, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Cullen, Cunningham, Cuthbert, Enders, Endsaw, Fluvanna, Galilee, Gritney, Kirvin, Luverne, Masada, Mattaponi, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Remlap, Sweatman, Tatum, Totier, Townley, Urland, Uwharrie, Vance, and Williamsville series. Albertville, Carnasaw, Enders, Gritney, Kirvin, Mattaponi, McQueen, Remlap, Tatum, Urland, Uwharrie, and Williamsville soils have sola thicker than 40 inches. Badin, Endsaw, Sweatman, Totier, and Townley soils have more silty Bt horizons. Bengal and Catharpin soils have 2Bt horizon over shale\nor sericite schist. Cullen soils typically have dark red subhorizons and overly mixed piedmont rocks. Cunningham and Galilee soils lack rock fragments or ironstone fragments in the soil profile. Cuthbert soils have Cr horizons at 20 to 40 inches and have appreciable mica in the C horizon. Fluvanna and Vance soils are developed in residuum from crystalline piedmont rock. Luverne soils have slightly cooler annual temperatures and lack ironstone fragments. Mayodan soils are less dry during the growing season. Masada soils have quartz pebbles in the solum. Nason and Tatum soils overly sericite schist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bonwier soils are on sloping to steep uplands of the West Coastal Plains. The soils formed in stratified loamy and clayey weakly consolidated sediments of Pleistocene age, mainly from the Willis formation. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent. The climate is humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches. Summer rainfall\nranges from 30 to 40 inches. Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 72."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Urland series, and the Doucette, Newco and Stringtown series. Doucette soils are on lower slopes and have thick sandy epipedons. Newco soils occur in concave positions near heads of drains and have gray mottles. Stringtown soils occur on similar positions and have fine-loamy control sections. Urland soils occur on less sloping landscapes and are developed to a depth of\nmore than 40 inches."
