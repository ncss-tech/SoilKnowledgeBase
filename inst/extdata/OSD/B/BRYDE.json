    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series.  Similar soils are the Cadell, Crockett, Gillett, Zack, and Zulch.  Cadell, Crockett, Zack and Zulch have a thermic temperature regime.  In addition, Cadell and Zack soils have iron depletions that are due to wetness.  Crockett soils have red and yellow masses of iron accumulation.  Zulch soils have an aquic moisture regime and have gleyed Bt horizons.  Gillett soils have sola less than 40 inches thick."
