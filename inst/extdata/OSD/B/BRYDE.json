  "OVERVIEW": "The Bryde series consists of soils that are deep to sandstone.  They are well drained, slowly permeable soils on gently sloping uplands.  They formed in loamy and clayey sediments over thinly interbedded weakly consolidated sandstone deposits of fine sandy loam texture.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.",
