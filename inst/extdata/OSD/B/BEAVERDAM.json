    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cimarron, Cucharas, Gourley, Heathcoat, Sudduth, Toponce, Wetopa and Youman series.  Cimarron soils lack an O horizon and formed in glacial till with rock fragments dominated by stones.  Cucharas soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Gourley soils have calcareous material at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Heathcoat soils have a calcic horizon at 10 to 30 inches.  Sudduth soils are pachic with a mollic epipedon beging 16 to 50 inches thick.  Toponce soils are pachic with a mollic epipedon 18 to 25 inches thick.  Wetopa soils have a mollic epipedon over 16 inches thick.  Youman soils have hue of 5YR to 10R throughout the subsoil and substratum."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beaverdam soils are on mountain slopes on all aspects.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Elevation is 5,500 to 7,500 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks dominantly quartzite and sandstone.  The average annual temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches.  The frost-free season is less than 50 days."

Cedarhill and Ireland soils have calcic horizons and are loamy skeletal.  Greys soils are fine-silty.  Harkness and Mikesell soils lack mollic epipedons.  Sedgway soils are loamy-skeletal.  Toponce soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 16 inches.  The Cedarhill and Ireland soils are on south and west-facing slopes where associated with Beaverdam.  The Greys and Toponce soils are on mountain footslopes at lower elevations and on slopes of less than 30 percent.  The Harkness and Mikesell soils are at higher elevations on mountain slopes, but where they are associated with Beaverdam they will occupy the colder positions.  The Sedgway soil is on mountain slopes, but usually occupies a more convex position higher on the slope."
