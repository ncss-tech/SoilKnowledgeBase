  "OVERVIEW": "The Beaverdam series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes.  They formed in colluvium from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks, dominantly quartzite and sandstone.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 26 inches and the average annual temperature is 39 degrees F.",

Cimarron soils lack an O horizon and formed in glacial till with rock fragments dominated by stones.  Cucharas soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Gourley soils have calcareous material at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Heathcoat soils have a calcic horizon at 10 to 30 inches.  Sudduth soils are pachic with a mollic epipedon beging 16 to 50 inches thick.  Toponce soils are pachic with a mollic epipedon 18 to 25 inches thick.  Wetopa soils have a mollic epipedon over 16 inches thick.  Youman soils have hue of 5YR to 10R throughout the subsoil and substratum."

Cedarhill and Ireland soils have calcic horizons and are loamy skeletal.  Greys soils are fine-silty.  Harkness and Mikesell soils lack mollic epipedons.  Sedgway soils are loamy-skeletal.  Toponce soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 16 inches.  The Cedarhill and Ireland soils are on south and west-facing slopes where associated with Beaverdam.  The Greys and Toponce soils are on mountain footslopes at lower elevations and on slopes of less than 30 percent.  The Harkness and Mikesell soils are at higher elevations on mountain slopes, but where they are associated with Beaverdam they will occupy the colder positions.  The Sedgway soil is on mountain slopes, but usually occupies a more convex position higher on the slope."
