The soils formed in recent alluvium derived in part from glacial outwash.  Elevations are 1,500 to 3,200 feet. . The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Garrison, Phoebe, Springdale, and Winthrop soils have a mesic temperature regime. In addition, Garrison and Phoebe soils are well drained, and Springdale and Winthrop soils are somewhat excessively drained. Sanpoil soils are poorly and very poorly drained. Wapal soils are sandy-skeletal and somewhat excessively drained."
