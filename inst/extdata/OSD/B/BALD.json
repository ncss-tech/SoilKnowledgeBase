    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soil is usually moist but is dry between depts of 4 and 12 inches for more than 45 consecutive days within the period following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 55 degrees F.  The thickness of the sola and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent in the A horizons and 35 to 80 percent in the B horizons, and dominantly are pebbles and cobbles.  The solum ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It has weak, fine or medium, subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It is loam or light clay loam and has more than 35 percent cobbles and pebbles.  This horizon has weak or moderate, medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe underlying bedrock is basalt that may be partially fractured with thin tongue of soil material in the fractures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash and colluvium weathered from basalt over basalt bedrock.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches.; The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 51 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The frost-free season (32 degrees ) is 100 to 140 days and (28 degrees F.) 140 to 180 days."
