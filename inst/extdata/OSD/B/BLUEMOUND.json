  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluemound series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in 10 to 20 inches of loess overlying Sioux quartzite bedrock. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",
