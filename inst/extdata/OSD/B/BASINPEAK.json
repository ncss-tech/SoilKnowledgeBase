Lag soils have O horizons, Bw horizons, and soil temperatures of 2.2 to 4.4 degrees C.\nSteepshrub soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have O and Bw horizons.  Sup soils have 5 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Timmercrek soils have 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have O, Bw and Bt horizons, and formed in till.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Basinpeak soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on convex backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite and minor amounts of granite. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,160 to 3,170 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm,  mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
