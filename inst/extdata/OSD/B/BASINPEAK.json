  "OVERVIEW": "The Basinpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite and minor amounts of granite. Basinpeak soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
