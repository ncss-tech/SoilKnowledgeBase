  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bucklake soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt and andesite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 2,400 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 310 mm and annual snowfall totals 500 to 1,020 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 to 0 degrees C., and mean July temperature is 17 to 19 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
