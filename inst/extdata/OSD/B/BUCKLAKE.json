  "OVERVIEW": "The Bucklake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or andesite.  Bucklake soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 310 mm and annual snowfall totals 500 to 1,020 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 to 0 degrees C., and mean July temperature is 17 to 19 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
