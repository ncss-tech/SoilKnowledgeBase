  "OVERVIEW": "The Billycreek series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy material weathered from sandstone and transported short distances. Billycreek soils are on mountain sides and canyon walls and have slopes of 6 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Small, flat or angular rock fragments of sandstone range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A&B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. The lamellae are usually fine and discontinuous, ranging in thickness from 1/16 to 1/4 inch, and the combined thickness is less than 6 inches. The lamellae are sandy loam or sandy clay loam. This horizon is slightly acid or moderately acid."
