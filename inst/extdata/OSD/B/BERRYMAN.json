    "content": "REMARKS: Classification History\n(1) Fine, mixed, mesic Typic Ustochrepts (original concept)\n(2) Fine-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Aridic Ustochrepts (1987).  Based on lab data S80NM-039-005 from NMSU and a better understanding of soil moisture regimes in New Mexico.\n(3) Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustepts (2000 taxonomy change)\n(4) Fine-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Haplocalcidic Haplustepts (~ 2003)\n(5) Fine-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Aridic Haplustepts (~ 2016)\nThe classification was changed from Haplocalcidic Haplustepts back to Aridic Haplustepts.  To be Haplocalcidic, the soil must have a calcic horizon within 100cm, and also be leached of carbonates in the top 18cm after mixing.  The historical concept of this series meets neither of these requirements.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 16 inches (Bw horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
