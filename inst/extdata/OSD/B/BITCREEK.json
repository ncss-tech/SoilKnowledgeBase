  "OVERVIEW": "The Bitcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These soils formed in residuum weathered from shale and/or sandstone. Bitcreek soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
