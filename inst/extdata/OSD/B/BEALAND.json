  "OVERVIEW": "The Bealand series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium dominantly from limestone.  They are on mountainsides, ridgetops and foothills.  Slopes are 10 to 70 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
