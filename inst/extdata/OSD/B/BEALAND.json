Adek soils average more than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have silica coats or pendants on rock fragments above 30 inches.  Dryadine soils have bedrock at 21 to 40 inches.  Whitore soils have an 0 horizon, 16 to 26 inches of annual precipitation and 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium dominantly from limestone.  Slopes range from 20 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches, most of which is in the form of snow.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 40 to 55 days."
