Oakville soils are excessively drained, Ottokee soils are moderately well drained, and Spinks soils are well drained; in addition, these soils do not have 2B or 2C horizons of medium textured lacustrine sediments, and are on higher beach ridges and dunes. Tedrow soils do not have 2B or 2C horizons of medium textured lacustrine sediments."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. The clayey substratum phase has a perched water table. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy upper material and moderately high in the medium textured lacustrine sediments. Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper material and moderate in the medium textured lacustrine sediments."
