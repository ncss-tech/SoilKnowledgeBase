  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bixler soils are on ridges, low knolls, and backslopes on lake plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in sandy lacustrine materials over medium textured, stratified lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

Colwood and Lamson soils are poorly and very poorly drained and are on flats or in depressions. Dixboro and Kibbie soils do not have an arenic epipedon. Oakville soils are excessively drained, Ottokee soils are moderately well drained, and Spinks soils are well drained; in addition, these soils do not have 2B or 2C horizons of medium textured lacustrine sediments, and are on higher beach ridges and dunes. Tedrow soils do not have 2B or 2C horizons of medium textured lacustrine sediments."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. The clayey substratum phase has a perched water table. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy upper material and moderately high in the medium textured lacustrine sediments. Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper material and moderate in the medium textured lacustrine sediments."
