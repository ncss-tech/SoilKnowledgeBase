  "OVERVIEW": "The Bispen series consists of deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits and alluvium derived from Navajo sandstone. These soils are on dunes structural benches with slopes of 2 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is 10 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
