    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bryce soils are on low-lying areas on till plains or glacial lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slope gradients commonly are less than 1 percent and range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in clayey water-sorted sediments and in the underlying clayey calcareous till. The upper sediments are lacustrine or local colluvial sediments from surrounding slopes or a combination of both kinds of sediments and increment or admixed loess. The sediments have a broader spectrum of clay minerals, lower bulk density, and greater available water capacity than the underlying till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 155 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 170 to 235 meters (558 to 771 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Mokena, Rutland, and Swygert soils are on nearby higher elevations or more sloping areas or both. Mokena soils are fine-loamy. Rutland soils contain 35 to 45 percent clay in the control section and have loess in the upper few feet of the solum. Swygert soils formed in similar materials and form a drainage sequence with Bryce soils. The very poorly drained, very slowly permeable Rantoul soils are in nearby lower-lying depressions and have higher COLE values."

Where drained, depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot)  below the surface at some time between January and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low (less than 0.42 micrometers per second). Permeability is very slow."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In soils such as this, with materials in the control section of mixed origin, clay mineralogy determinations are imprecise. Several indicators should be used. The X-ray diffraction patterns at NSSL indicate a montmorillonitic placement. However, that method should be compared to weighted CEC/clay and LE/clay ratios which are outside the limits commonly set for the smectitic mineralogy class. The relative proportions of clay minerals, is a function of the kind and amount of mixing of materials over the till. In all pedons the mineralogy of the till is illitic.\nA bedrock substratum phase is recognized. These soils will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if new series needed.\nAn evaluation of Bryce soils in the map unit \"Bryce silty clay loam, 0 to 2 slopes\" in MLRA 110 identified a possible densic restriction in the Cg horizon. Existing lab data, pedons and similar soils were reviewed to come to this conclusion. Additional collection of lab data on bulk density and water table fluctuations are necessary to determine whether the water table is epi or endo in nature.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 48 cm (0 to 19 inches) (Ap1, Ap2 and Bg horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 48 to 152 cm (19 to 60 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and 2BCg horizons)."
