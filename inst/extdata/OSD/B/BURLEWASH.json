  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Burlewash series consists of moderately deep to tuffaceous sandstone. These well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in materials weathered from tuffaceous sandstone or siltstone. These gently sloping to very steep upland soils are on interfluves and side slopes of ridges. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.",
