  "OVERVIEW": "The Brumley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone.  Brumley soils are on terraces and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
