The soil between depths of 6 inches and 19 inches is moist in all parts from January 1 through March 30 and is dry in all parts from June 1 through October 15.  Soil is influenced by some amorphous material.  The clay content continues to increase with depth to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 6/2, 6/4; or 10YR 6/3, 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4; 10YR 3/4 or 5YR 3/4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Gravel content is 5 to 15 percent.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 5YR 4/6, 5/6, 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 2.5YR 4/6.  Chromas of 6 occur in at least the lower part of the argillic horizon.  It is clay, gravelly clay, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.  The particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay.  Gravel content is 5 to 25 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 5 percent.  It is weakly or moderately smeary."

The soils are formed in volcanic ash, breccia, or tuff.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 25 to 40 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 205 days."
