  "OVERVIEW": "The Benridge series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in amorphous material primarily weathered from dacite, or pyroclastic tuff and breccia.  Benridge soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F.",

Soil is influenced by some amorphous material.  The clay content continues to increase with depth to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 6/2, 6/4; or 10YR 6/3, 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4; 10YR 3/4 or 5YR 3/4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Gravel content is 5 to 15 percent.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 5YR 4/6, 5/6, 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 2.5YR 4/6.  Chromas of 6 occur in at least the lower part of the argillic horizon.  It is clay, gravelly clay, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.
