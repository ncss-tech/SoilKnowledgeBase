  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Batan soils are on stream terraces, flood plains, and alluvial flat remnants. These soils formed in silty alluvium form mixed rock sources of mostly volcanic origin that are high in loess and pyroclastic material. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,865 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."

Hessing soils are coarse-loamy and have less than 20 percent durinodes in the Bq horizon. Landco, Rosney, and Sonoma soils lack a Bq horizon. Landco soil also are coarse-silty over clayey, and Sonoma soils are saturated at some period in most years. Ocala soils are somewhat poorly drained."

The vegetation on salt and sodium affected areas is principally weak greasewood, shadscale, littleleaf horsebrush, suaeda, and basin wildrye. On less salt and sodium affected areas vegetation is principally bud sagebrush, saltbush, bottlebrush squirreltail, pepperweed, and other mustards."
