These soils have developed in gravelly colluvium materials, usually from 40 inches to several feet thick, from igneous hills and mountains. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 12 to 20 inches. The winter and spring months are the driest and summer and fall are the wettest. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 66 degrees F. Frost free period ranges from 180 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 3,300 to 6,695 feet."
