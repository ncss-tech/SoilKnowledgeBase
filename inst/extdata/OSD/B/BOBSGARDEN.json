The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35  percent clay and 35 to 65 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Solum thickness is 25 to 40 inches.  The solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bobsgarden soils are on metastable broad ridgetops and active south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.   Elevations are 2,500 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 160 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."
