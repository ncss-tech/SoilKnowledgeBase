  "OVERVIEW": "The Bobsgarden series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Bobsgarden soils are on broad ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 145 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
