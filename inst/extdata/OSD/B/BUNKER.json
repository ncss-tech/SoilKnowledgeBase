Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average l5 to 35 percent.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 95 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 15 to 20 percent for air dried samples.  Organic carbon is less than 4 percent in some part of the upper 2/3 of the particle-size control section. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of l to 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  It has 0 to l5 percent pebbles.  It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 5YR through l0YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  It ranges from loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam with l0 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It has 1 to 10 percent organic matter decreasing to less than 7 percent below 20 inches."

These soils formed in colluvium weathered from basalt. Winters are cool and moist and summers are warm and dry.  The average annual temperature is about 50  F., average January temperature is about 38 F., and average July  temperature is about 60  F.  Annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 120 inches.  The growing season (28 F.) is 180 to 240 days."
