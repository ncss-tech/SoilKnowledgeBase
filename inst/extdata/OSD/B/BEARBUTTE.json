    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bearbutte soils are on plateaus, mountains, and hills.  They typically occur on footslope, backslope and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from tuffaceous rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
