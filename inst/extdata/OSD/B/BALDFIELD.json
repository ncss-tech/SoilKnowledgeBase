  "OVERVIEW": "The Baldfield series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in residuum and alluvium from shale on fan piedmonts, stream terraces, valley sides, and valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",
