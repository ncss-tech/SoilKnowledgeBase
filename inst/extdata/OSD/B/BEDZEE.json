The paralithic materials below the contact are soft, tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.\nParticle-size control section:  Clay content: 35 to 60 percent.\nRock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as rhyolite and andesite.\nA horizon\nValue: 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.\n2Bt horizon\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nClay content: 40 to 60 percent.\nStructure: Fine or medium, prismatic or angular blocky; lower Bt horizon if present may be massive.\nConsistence: Moderately sticky or very sticky, moderately plastic or very plastic.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brisbois, Chalco, Espint, Gumble, and Xman series.\nBrisbois soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon and have identifiable secondary carbonates.  Chalco soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Espint soils have Bt1 horizons with 27 to 40 percent clay and are moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer.  Gumble soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C. and have noneffervescent Bt horizons.  Xman soils are shallow to weathered rhyolite or andesite, have mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C., and also have hard bedrock, below the weathered bedrock, at depths of 50 to 100 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bedzee soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  The sediment composing these rocks is Tertiary in age, tuffaceous in nature, and was deposited in a lacustrine paleoenvironment.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,615 to 1,920 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Jobpeak soils are very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, have ochric epipedons, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Loomer soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons."
