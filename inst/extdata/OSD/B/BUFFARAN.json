  "OVERVIEW": "The Buffaran series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Buffaran soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
