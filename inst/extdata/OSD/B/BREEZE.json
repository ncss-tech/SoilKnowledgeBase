  "STATES": "NJ,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Breeze series consists of very deep, well drained soils. The soil formed in a thick mantle of sandy human-transported soil materials intermingled with demolished construction debris. These soils occur on modified landscapes in and near major urbanized portions of the Northeast. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the surface and very high in the subsoil and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C Mean annual precipitation is about 1196 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the human-transported soil materials range from 1 to 2 meters or greater and may originate from sandy marine deposits, sandy eolian deposits, or sandy glaciofluvial deposits, usually from a very local source. The human artifacts may include plastic, glass, rubber, brick, lumber, asphalt, coal ash, unburned coal, gypsum board, concrete, and steel artifacts. Coarse fragments range from 2 to 34 percent by volume throughout the profile with greater than 10 percent human artifacts within the particle size control section. Textures range from sandy loam to coarse sand, and gravelly-artifactual to bouldery-artifactual texture modifiers can occur. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Moist color hues range from 2.5YR through 2.5Y throughout.\nThe ^Au or ^A horizon has value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is characterized by granular structure and by organic matter accumulation. Consistence is very friable to firm. Some pedons have a ^ACu or ^AC with similar properties.\nThe ^Bu has value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Structure is subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^Cu has value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is single grain or massive and consistence is loose or very friable. Some pedons have a 2^C with similar properties."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Breeze soils are on nearly level to moderately steep artificially-created or human-altered landforms. These soils formed in human-transported materials consisting of sandy soil materials intermingled with human artifacts (typically construction debris). The sandy soil materials may originate from sandy glaciofluvial deposits, dredged sandy marine deposits, or sandy eolian deposits. The construction debris material commonly originates from the demolition of buildings and roads. The dominant human artifacts are concrete, asphalt, brick, coal ash, and steel. Natural rock fragments, if present, are derived mainly from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Some pedons are underlain by sandy dredge materials with low artifact content. Slope commonly ranges from 0 to 15 percent but the range includes up to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1230 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 17 degrees C."

Barren, Bigapple, Fortress, and Jamaica soils formed in sandy dredge materials with low human artifact content. Hooksan soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. Gravesend soils contain more than 35 percent human artifacts and/or rock fragments in the control section.  Ipswich, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, Sandyhook, and Westbrook soils are subject to tidal flooding. Verrazano soils have a contrasting particle size class within 100 cm from soil surface."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is very low to low on vegetated slopes less than 20 percent, and medium on vegetated slopes 20 percent and greater. The potential for surface runoff is one class more rapid where the soil is unvegetated or the surface is poorly protected from erosion. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the surface and very high in the subsoil and substratum."

Recreational use is unlikely where surface fragments and boulders have not been removed or covered. Phragmites, mugwort, goldenrod, and beachgrass are typical plants found growing on this soil."
