  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 20 to 40 inches. The weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the weighted average content of fine or coarser sand is less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle; from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy lower subsoil (transition zone).   Volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average and from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon but it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Free carbonates are absent to depths of more than 5 feet.  Redoximorphic concentrations are within a depth of 40 inches.  Redoximorphic depletions are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon in some pedons.  These are due to periods of saturation caused by restricted internal drainage associated with contrasting porosity at the sandy outwash contact.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where moist value is 3, dry value is greater than 5.5.  Uncultivated areas have a 1 to 5 inch thick A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  It is silt loam or silt.\nBrill soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt horizon described above.  Some pedons with B/E horizons do not have Bt horizons.\nThe 2Bt transition horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt or 3BC horizon (2Bt or 2BC horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) has color like the 3Bt horizon described above.  It is stratified layers of sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Anigon series.  Similar soils are the Brander and Sconsin series. Anigon soils do not have a zone of saturation with redoximorphic within the series control section. Brander soils are Oxyaquic Glossudalfs that have an apparent seasonal water table within 40 inches of the surface for longer than 30 days duration in normal years.  Sconsin soils average 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

Anigon soils are on more sloping landscape position.  Brander, Poskin, and Rib soils are on lower landscape positions associated with apparent water tables, or are adjacent to moraines.\nThe moderately well drained Blackriver and Ribriver soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Maplehurst soils are on nearby landscapes with Brill soils where the silty mantle is more than 40 inches thick.  Blackriver soils are on similar landscape positions.  Ribriver and Maplehurst soils are on lower landscape positions associated with apparent water tables, or are adjacent to moraines.\nThe well drained Rosholt soils, moderately well drained Scoba and Scott Lake soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Oesterle soils are on nearby landscapes with Brill soils where the silty mantle is thin or absent.  Rosholt soils are on similar, higher, or more sloping landscape positions.  Scoba, Scott Lake, and Oesterle soils are on lower landscape positions associated with apparent water tables, or are adjacent to moraines."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is medium or low.  Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Brill soils have a perched seasonal high water table above the sandy outwash contact at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet for up to 30 days duration at some time during the period of March to May in normal years. Internal drainage is restricted by contrasting pore size at the sandy outwash contact, resulting in a perched zone of saturation in the silty and loamy mantle during wet periods."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

Native vegetation is dominantly deciduous forest with a few conifers in some areas.  Common trees are sugar maple, American elm, red maple, white pine, and white spruce predominant."
