  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A horizon ranges widely in color, from 5YR 2/1 through 10YR 4/4.  Its texture ranges from loam to silt loam. It is absent or very thin in some pedons.  Matrix colors in the C horizon range from 2.5Y 4/2 through 5Y 5/3.  Textures range from silt loam to gravelly loam; the proportion of gravel usually increases with depth.  Depth to the permafrost table ranges from 20 to 80 inches, and is inversely correlated with the thickness and proportion of moss in the O horizon.  COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bradway, Dotlake, and Tanana series of the same family.  The Bradway and Tanana soils have substantial mica and are free of gravel.  Dotlake soils have stratas of fine sand in the lower control section."

The regolith is weathered sedimentary or metamorphic rock, in places mixed with or covered by thin deposits of loess.  The climate is subarctic continental, with long cold winters and short warm summers.  Mean annual air temperatures are less than 32 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is less than 20 inches."
