  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. These soils form cracks when dry that extend to depths of 20 inches or more and remain open for 10 to 30 days during normal years.  PLE calculated from the COLE is 6 to 10 cm. in the upper 40 inches of the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where value is 3, the thickness of the layer is 4 inches or less, and the soil material when mixed to a depth of 7 inches has value of 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown or olive.  Most peds have dark gray or very dark gray, silty or clayey coatings.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline. In some pedons, one or more subhorizons of the Bt horizon contain 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate concretions that are 2 to 20 mm. in diameter.\nThe 2ABg horizon, where present has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown or olive.  Most peds have dark gray or very dark gray, silty or clayey coatings.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btg or BCg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown or olive.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons, the 2Btg or BCg horizon contains 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate concretions that are 2 to 20 mm. in diameter.\nThe 2Cg or Cg horizon, where present has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown or olive.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on the middle and lower parts of natural levees. Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent. Baldwin soils formed in alluvium from older runs of the Mississippi River where sediments have weathered enough to develop argillic horizons.  The climate is humid temperate; mean annual precipitation is 56 inches, and mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F. near the type location."

Dundee, Galvez, and Loreauville soils are on the higher parts of the natural levee, and have less than 35 percent clay in the subsoil.  Iberia soils are on lower, backswamp positions, form slickensides, and have a dark colored surface layer more than 12 inches thick."
