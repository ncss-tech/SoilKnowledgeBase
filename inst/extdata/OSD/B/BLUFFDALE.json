The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 55 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 65 degrees to 75 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days or more in more than 7 years out of 10.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It contains 0 to 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and is mildly to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay loam (more than 35 percent clay) or silty clay. This horizon has moderate to weak medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate and strong, angular and subangular blocks.  It contains few to continuous, thin to moderately thick clay films. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the upper part and 15 to 30 percent in the lower part, but the clay films on faces of peds may be noncalcareous. Lime is partly disseminated and partly in soft accretions.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5.6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist and chroma of 1.6 through 3. It has few to many, faint to distinct mottles. This horizon is silt loam to silty clay. It contains 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in veins, flakes or soft accretions, and is moderately to very strongly alkaline."

The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 150 days. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches."

The series is used in the Salt Lake Area Soil Survey.  This 1974 publication indicates that the seasonal high water table is below 60 inches and that the soil is moderately well drained.  No explanation is provided for the presence of mottles.  Further investigation is needed to determine if there is a seasonal high water table.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
