  "REMARKS": {

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - from 6 to 16 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nAndic feature - from mineral soil surface to 6 inches (A horizon). Based on lab data from similar soils and field observations. This soil does not classify into an Andic subgroup since the Lithic subgroup classifies out first in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nLithic subgroup - very strongly cemented sandstone at 19 inches\nParticle-size control section (Loamy-skeletal family) - from 11 to 16 inches (Bw2 horizon).\nThe Cr over R bedrock is recognized as a diagnostic feature for this series.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available for S01OR003-011, NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 5/02.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
