  "OVERVIEW": "The Bit series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Bit soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone but includes dolostone, quartzite, and some reworked lacustrine deposits that may contain volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 6,100 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 and 12 inches that comes mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

The series is not extensive and its acreage was remapped with other soils.\nThe revision of January 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Xeric Petrocalcids and recognizes the presence of a calcic horizon."
