Lithology of fragments are mainly limestone or dolostone.\nA horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nStructure: Weak or moderate, very thin through thick platy.\nConsistence: Soft or slightly hard.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nC horizons - Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nClay content: 10 to 18 percent.\nReaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline (up to pH 9.6).\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 20 percent.\n2Bk horizons - 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nClay content: 7 to 15 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 50 percent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 60 percent.\n2Bqkm horizons - Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nCementation:  Individual laminae are 1 to 1 to 5 mm thick. The combined thickness of all laminae is 5 to 20 mm.  The laminae are stratified with strongly or weakly lime cemented materials, or alternating strata of the 2.  These materials are hard to extremely hard, and firm to extremely firm.  Few to common discontinuous 1 mm or less thick silica laminae are in some pedons and have chroma of 3 through 5.  These are in the strongly or weakly cemented materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bit soils are on planar to slightly concave stream terraces and on fan remnants.  They typically occur on tread or summit positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone but includes dolostone, quartzite, and some reworked lacustrine deposits that may contain volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 6,100 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 and 12 inches that comes mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 2 inches (A horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 24 to 34 inches (2Bk horizon).\nPetrocalcic horizon - The zone from 34 to 38 inches (2Bkqm1 and 2Bkqm2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 34 inches (C3 and 2Bk horizons and part of the C2 horizon).\nThis series was inactivated in August 2008 due to the extensive revision of the soil survey of Meadow Valley Area, Nevada (NV613).  The series is not extensive and its acreage was remapped with other soils.\nThe revision of January 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Xeric Petrocalcids and recognizes the presence of a calcic horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
