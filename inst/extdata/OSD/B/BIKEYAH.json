Elevation ranges from 8,400 to 9,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Berland soils are very shallow to sandstone and occur on adjacent knolls and benches.  Captom soils lack mollic epipedons and occur on steep backslopes.  Klizhin soils are well drained, wooded, and occur on footslopes below Captom soils.  Retaw soils are very poorly drained and have standing water on the surface."
