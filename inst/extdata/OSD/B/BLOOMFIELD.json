  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development is 60 to more than 80 inches 152 to 203 cm). The argillic horizon occurs as lamellae and banded layers up to 8 inches (20 cm) in thickness. The combined thickness of the lamellae above a depth of 60 inches (152 cm) is more than 6 inches (15 cm).\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma typically of 2 to 4. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid, and can range to neutral where limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E and Bt or C horizon averages between 75 and 95 percent total sand. The fine sand plus medium sand content ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the total soil. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand and occurs as interband material and typically is single grain and loose. The Bt lamellae and banded layers have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. The lamellae and banded layers are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand, and less commonly sand. A few lamellae can range to fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. The Bt lamellae and bands typically have weak subangular blocky structure. They are wavy and discontinuous in the upper part, joining and separating across a single pedon, and becoming thicker and more continuous with increasing depth.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or sand and is single grain and loose. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 0 to 20 percent."

Slope gradients dominantly are 4 to 12 percent and range from 1 to 60 percent. Bloomfield soils formed in wind-deposited sands. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 48 inches (762 to 1219 mm). Frost free days range from 150 to 200.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Bloomfield series was originally correlated in Greene County, Indiana in 1906. The series included soils now classified in the Princeton Series. The original series was dropped in 1913 (U.S. Bur. Soils Bul. 96), and was redefined when established in 1952. The data in both Illinois and Indiana supports the change in classification from coarse-loamy to a sandy family.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 inches (96 cm), (Ap, E1 and E2 horizons); argillic horizon - the Bt lamellae to a depth of 80 inches (203 cm), (E and Bt horizons); udic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
