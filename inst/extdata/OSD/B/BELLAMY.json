  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellamy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of loamy colluvium and alluvium.  They are on stream terraces in the Ridge and Valley portion of the Southern Appalachians. They have some properties of a fragipan beginning at a depth of about two feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
