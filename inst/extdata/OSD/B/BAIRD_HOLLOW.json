  "OVERVIEW": "The Baird Hollow series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on mountain slopes and glacial moraines.  They formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and colluvium from basic igneous rock and some sedimentary rocks.  Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",

At the lower elevations, these soils are on steep slopes with north aspect.  Slope gradients are mainly 3 to 25 percent and range from 3 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and colluvium from basic igneous rock and some sedimentary rocks.  The climate is humid with 22 to 35 inches of precipitation falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 34 to 41 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is less than 59 degrees F. The freeze-free period is 40 to 70 days."
