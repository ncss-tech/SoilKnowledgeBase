    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe Bt horizon extends into cracks in the sandstone. A few sandstone rock fragments are on the surface. A thin mat of roots is often present at the point of contact above the sandstone.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: the zone from the surface to a maximum depth of 20 inches (A and Bt horizons). Argillic horizon: the zone from 5 to 13 inches (Bt horizon).\nThe Brownson series was formerly included in the Canyon and Rosebud series.\nThe 2Cr is being investigated as a petrocalcic horizon. The petrocalcic horizon formed in the Ash Hollow formation of the Ogallala group deposited 5 to 10 million years ago during the Pliocene Epoch. There are areas of the petrocalcic horizon that have fractures less than the required horizontal spacing of 10cm.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
