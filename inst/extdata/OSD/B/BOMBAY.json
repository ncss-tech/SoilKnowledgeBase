  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to carbonates is 25 to 70 inches. Redoximorphic features occur within 40 inches of the mineral soil surface. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent, by volume, in the mineral solum and from 10 to 35 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure, and very friable or friable consistence. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. The horizon is massive, or it has weak or moderate granular, subangular blocky, or platy structure. Consistence is very friable to firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with higher value that replaces the BE horizon.\nThe Bt/E horizons have properties like the Bt horizon in the interiors of the peds, and E-like material on the exterior of ped. The E material has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 and chroma of 2 through 6. Redoximorphic accumulations may or may not be present in the Bt/E horizons. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Redoximorphic accumulations range from few to many. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has texture and color similar to the Bt horizon except for value which is generally higher. Structure is subangular blocky or platy, or the horizon is massive. Redoximorphic accumulations range from few to many. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or may have weak or moderate plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm. Redoximorphic accumulations range from few to many. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Galen and Mt. Zion series are in the same family. Galen soils contain more sand in the Bt horizon than the Bombay soils, which formed in till. The Mt. Zion soils formed in residuum and are more acid.\nConesus, Hilton, Lima, Madrid, Aftad, Blowers, Feldhauser, Freeon, Haugen, Neopit and Scott Lake are similar series in related families. Conesus, Hilton and Lima soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections. Madrid soils lack redoximorphic features above a depth of 40 inches. Aftad, Blowers, Feldhauser, Freeon, Haugen, Neopit and Scott Lake have a frigid soil temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bombay soils are in nearly level to strongly sloping landforms on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils developed in late Wisconsin till derived mainly from sandstone and limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and the frost-free period ranges from 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 95 to 700 feet above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Madrid soils, the somewhat poorly drained Massena and Appleton soils, and the poorly and very poorly drained Sun soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Amenia and Nellis soils, which have cambic horizons and the finer textured Honeoye, Lansing, Mohawk and Ontario soils and their wetter associates are on nearby till plains. Alton, Howard, Kars, and Palmyra soils are on nearby glacial outwash plains and terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previous classification was Glossoboric Hapludalfs. Because of changes in the 8th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy, this soil now falls into the subgroup of Oxyaquic Hapludalfs. New pedon from Essex County was used to reflect the Oxyaquic Hapludalfs characteristic which is dominant in New York State.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon:\n1) Ochric Epipedon - from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Glossic horizon - from 10 to 18 inches (Bt/E horizon).\n3) Argillic Horizon - from 10 to 25 inches (B part of Bt/E, and Bt horizons).\n4) Oxyaquic Subgroup - as evidenced by redoximorphic accumulation of iron above 40 inches (Bt/E, Bt, and BC horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Additional data from pedon S85NY019-11 Cornell University Lab.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
