  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more\nthan 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Volume of rock fragments, commonly gravel of sandstone and fragments of chert, ranges from\n0 to 10 percent throughout the soil.  Unless limed, the soil is\nvery strongly through moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe BW horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon above the fragipan has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The Bt1 horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Average content of fine sand and coarser is more then 40 percent.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Both low and high chroma mottles\nare common or many in these horizons.  The Bx horizon is sandy\nloam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 6 through 8.  The 2Bt2 horizons range from sandy\nloam to clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in the same\nfamily.  Related series in other families are the Boonton,\nHibernia, Laidig, Landisburg, Monongahela, and Rockaway.  Boonton, Hibernia, and Rockaway soils have more than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the control section.  Laidig, Landisburg, and\nMonongahela soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle\nsize control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burketown soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The upper part of these soils formed in old alluvium from soils derived largely from acid sandstone and shale.  The lower part formed in alluvium derived from limestone influenced soils or in limestone residuum.  The average annual temperature is less than 57 degrees F with a range from about 50 degrees to 57 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 42 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Frederick, Millrock, Monongahela, and Shenval soils.  Frederick and Shenval soils have over 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and are redder in color.  Millrock soils lack both an argillic horizon and\na fragipan.  Monongehela soils have fine-loamy particle size\ncontrol sections."

The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not laboratory data.  Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon descriptions (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision date: 5/84\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
