  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Burketown series are very deep and moderately well drained.  They formed in old alluvial material derived from acid sandstone and shale.  These soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

Volume of rock fragments, commonly gravel of sandstone and fragments of chert, ranges from\n0 to 10 percent throughout the soil.  Unless limed, the soil is\nvery strongly through moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe BW horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon above the fragipan has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The Bt1 horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Average content of fine sand and coarser is more then 40 percent.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Both low and high chroma mottles\nare common or many in these horizons.  The Bx horizon is sandy\nloam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 6 through 8.  The 2Bt2 horizons range from sandy\nloam to clay."

The upper part of these soils formed in old alluvium from soils derived largely from acid sandstone and shale.  The lower part formed in alluvium derived from limestone influenced soils or in limestone residuum.  The average annual temperature is less than 57 degrees F with a range from about 50 degrees to 57 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 42 inches."
