  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 43 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 35 inches.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons, but a major part of the solum and C horizon above 50 inches has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above 50 inches and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or light clay but averages 35 to 50 percent clay, 10 to 40 percent silt, and 15 to 50 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It is typically loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with more than 18 percent but less than 35 percent clay.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arling, Brolliar, Buckskin, Florissant, Getta, Gothic, Gurney, Heath, Jerry, Judy, Little Horn, Mayoworth, Needleton, Owen Creek, Segal, Sessions, Sneffels, Trout Creek, Turk, Waters, and Youman series.  Arling soils have a significant component of volcanic ash and pyroclastic material throughout the solum and C horizon.  Brolliar, Getta, Judy, Little Horn, Sneffels, and Waters soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Buckskin soils have solums thicker than 40 inches have prominent skeletons on faces of peds.  Florissant, Mayoworth, Owen Creek, Trout Creek, and Truk soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Gothic soils have more than 35 percent clay in all parts of the solum and C horizon above a depth of 50 inches.  Gurney soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments most of which are larger than 10 inches in diameter within the solum.  Also, Gurney soils dominantly have 5YR hue in the B2t horizon.  Heath and Jerry soils are calcareous above a depth of 40 inches and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Needleton soils have at least 5 percent rock fragments that effervesce in acid throughout the solum and C horizons and have a CaCO3 equivalent of 8 to 39 percent.  Segal soils have a B2t horizon with an abrupt upper boundary and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower solum and C horizon.  Sessions and Youman soils have lithochromic hues of 5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Brinkert soils are on gentle to moderately sloping alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes typically range from 2 percent to about 15 percent.  The soil formed in thick noncalcareous, alluvial fan materials derived principally from gneiss, schist, granite, and sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F and mean summer temperature is 55 degrees F."
