  "OVERVIEW": "The Bulletproof series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitoid. These soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the average annual temperature is 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
