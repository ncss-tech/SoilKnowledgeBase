  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the till ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Content of rock fragments is 2 to 15 percent by volume in the upper part and 5 to 20 percent in the lower part.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology, mostly igneous in origin.  Some areas have enough stones on the surface to recognize as a phase.  The control section has 8 to 18 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent fine sand or coarser material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The A horizon commonly is sandy loam, but the range includes fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is commonly sandy loam, but includes fine sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Some pedons have thin EB or BE transitional horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and has faint to prominent mottles.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and has faint to prominent mottles.  Clay films are on faces of peds or in pores in some pedons.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  This horizon is restrictive to root penetration due to the platy soil structure, which is a property of the dense till, but is not as restrictive as the Cd horizon.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or gravelly analogues, and has faint to prominent mottles.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nA bedrock substratum phase is recognized."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping drumlins and ground moraines.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  Brainerd soils formed in noncalcareous dense loamy glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature is about 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1400 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Flak, Nokay, Parent, and Prebish soils which form a drainage sequence with the Brainerd soils.  The Flak soils are well drained and are on steeper and higher lying positions.  Nokay soils are somewhat poorly drained soils on less sloping and lower lying positions.  Parent soils are poorly drained soils on flats or swales.  Prebish soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions."
