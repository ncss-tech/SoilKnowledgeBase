  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 55 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is from 5 to 50 feet or more.  Depth to low chroma mottles ranges from 16 to 30 inches.  The solum or C horizons are stratified within 40 inches and stratified sand and gravel is at depths of 30 to 72 inches.  Rock fragments of dominately gravel range from 0 to 30 percent in the A and Bw horizons and from 20 to 50 percent in the Bx horizon.  Reaction, where not limed, ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid above the Bx, and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the Bx and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 through 6, and it can be mottled.  It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth.  Structure is weak fine or medium subangular blocky.  Consistency is friable.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 through 6, and it is mottled.  It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth.  Structure is weak very coarse prismatic parting to weak medium or thick platy.  Consistency is firm and brittle.  Some pedons have thin BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 5YR.  It  is usually gravelly loamy sand or sandy loam and includes stratified layers of sand, gravel, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Bath, Broadalbin, Ira, Lackawanna,  Mardin, Rushford, Sodus, Swartswood, Wellsboro,  and Wurtsboro soils are in the same family.\nAll of the listed series lack stratified materials within the series control section, do not have C horizons that have loamy sand textures or have Cd horizons.  Montauk soils lack Bx horizons and lack mottles above a depth of 30 inches.\nThe Atherton, Bridgeville, Fredon, Jimtown, Ludlow,  Montauk, Nantucket, Red Hook, Rexford, Sciotoville, and Wethersfield soils are in related families.  All of these soils except Rexford and Sciotville soils lack fragipans.\nRexford soils have a horizon with 50 percent or more redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches of the mineral surface and redoximorphic concentrations with 12 inches of the surface.  Sciotoville soils have an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Braceville soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on terraces, beaches, fans, and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in glacial outwash of stratified sand, silt, and gravel derived largely from noncalcareous gray sandstone and shale, but contain small amounts of reddish rocks and limestone.  Some pedons have a thin silty mantle.  Climate is humid and temperate, with mean annual precipitation of 34 to 44 inches; average annual temperature of 45 degrees to 52 degrees F., and the growing season is 120 to 170 days."

Alton, Chenango, Conotton, Riverhead, and Tunkhannock soils are well drained or somewhat excessively drained, lack fragipans, and commonly are on uplands above the Braceville soils.  Atherton soils are poorly or very poorly drained on depressions or lowlands.  Fredon, Red Hook, and Rexford soils have a horizon with dominant chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches."
