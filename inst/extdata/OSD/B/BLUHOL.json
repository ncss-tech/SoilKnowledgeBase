  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluhol series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in gypsiferous alluvium .  These nearly level soils are in depressions and on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from  0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
