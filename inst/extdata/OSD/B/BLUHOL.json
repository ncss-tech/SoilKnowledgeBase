Water table ranges from depths of 1 to 3 feet and is spring fed.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in gypsiferous alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 60 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 180 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,000 feet."
