Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except where lime has been added.  Fragments of gravel range from none to 10 percent in the A, Bt, and Btx horizons.  Depth to hard bedrock is greater than 5 feet.  Transition horizons have color and textures similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe Ap and A horizon have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Where severely eroded, the Ap has colors and textures similiar to the Bt horizon.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Redox features in shades of brown, black, and gray range from none to common in the lower part of the horizon.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and less commonly silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Common to many redox features are in shades of brown, black, yellow, red, and gray  Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and less commonly silty clay loam."

Captina, Dickson, Gigger, and Paden soils are fine-silty. Monongahela and Captina soils are have a mesic temperature regime. Sango soils have a coarse-silty.particle size control section.  Swafford soils are siliceous and do not have a fragipan.  Tarklin soils are siliceious and have a gravelly gravelly fragipan."
