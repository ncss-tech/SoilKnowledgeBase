These soil are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.\nThe A horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, with a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Structure is weak or moderate granular, weak fine platy or weak or moderate crumb.\nThe Bw horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist with a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Structure is weak or moderate medium to coarse prismatic or weak medium subangular.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and has 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist with chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.
