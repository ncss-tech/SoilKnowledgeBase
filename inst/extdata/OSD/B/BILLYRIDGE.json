  "OVERVIEW": "The Billyridge series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Billyridge soils are on fans and terraces at elevations from 1,100 to 1,700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be 47 to 49 degrees F.  These soil are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.\nThe A horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, with a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Structure is weak or moderate granular, weak fine platy or weak or moderate crumb.\nThe Bw horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist with a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Structure is weak or moderate medium to coarse prismatic or weak medium subangular.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and has 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist with chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Texture is sandy loam or loamy sand and has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments."
