The soils are usually dry but are moist in some part between a depth of 8 inches and bedrock for 60 to 80 days in the spring.  Basalt bedrock is at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. This horizon is slightly or strongly effervescent."
