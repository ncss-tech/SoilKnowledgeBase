  "OVERVIEW": "The Bobzbulz series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from fanglomerate dominated by granite, schist and gneiss clasts. The Bobzbulz series are on dissected fan terraces and ballenas. Slopes are 2 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",
