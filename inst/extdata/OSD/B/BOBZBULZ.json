    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bobzbulz soils are on summits and side slopes of dissected fan terraces and ballenas. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from fanglomerate dominated by granite, schist and gneiss clasts. Slopes are 2 to 55 percent. The elevations are 1500 to 2800 feet. The climate is arid with mild, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 9 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F. The frost free period is 210 to 350 days."
