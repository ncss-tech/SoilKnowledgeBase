  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackloup series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy deposits over sandy and gravelly alluvium on flood plains. Permeability is rapid or very rapid below the loamy deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean air annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",
