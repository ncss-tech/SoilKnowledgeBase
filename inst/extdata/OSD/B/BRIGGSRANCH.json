  "REVDATE": "03/2012",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Briggsranch series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from conglomerate, quartzite, limestone and dolomite. These soils occur on escarpments, mountain slopes and canyons.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
