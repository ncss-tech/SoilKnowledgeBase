  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is greater than 60 inches. Depth to cherty bedrock is greater than 5 feet. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed. Rock fragments are mostly gravel, cobbles, and stones of chert and range from 20 to 85 percent in individual horizons but average between 35 and 80 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the Bt horizon also has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8. Mottles, in shades of brown, yellow and red, range from none to many throughout the Bt horizon. The lower part may be mottled with no dominant matrix color. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Caston series is the only other series in this family. The Panama series is in a closely related family. Caston soils formed in colluvium from sandstone and shale and the fragments in the soil are mostly sandstone. Panama soils have a clayey 2Bt horizon and are in an active CEC activity class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bodine soils are on sharply dissected uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The soil formed in residuum weathered from cherty limestone. The uppermost layers often are influenced by colluvium from soil creep. Near the type location, average annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 52 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dickson, Fullerton, and Mountview series on uplands, the Minvale series on foot slopes, the Humphreys series on stream terraces and the Ennis and Lobelville on flood plains. All of these series contain less than 35 percent rock fragments. Dickson and Mountview soils formed in a loess mantle. Dickson soils have a fragipan and Mountview soils have a clayey 2Bt. Fullerton soils are clayey. Humphreys and Minvale soils are loamy with 15 to 35 percent fragments. Ennis and  Lobelville soils do not have an argillic horizon."
