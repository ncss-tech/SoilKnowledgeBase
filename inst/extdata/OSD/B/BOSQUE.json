  "OVERVIEW": "The Bosque series consists of very deep to loamy alluvium, well drained soils that formed in loamy, calcareous alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from limestone and shale.  These nearly level soils are on treads of flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 786 mm (30.95 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.7 degrees C (63.8 degrees F).",
