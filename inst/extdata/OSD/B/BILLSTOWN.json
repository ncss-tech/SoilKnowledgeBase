Slopes are generally 1 to 15 percent, but may be as steep as 35 percent in some places. These soils formed in clayey sediments overlying marl or chalk. The average annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 18 degress C (60 to 65 degrees F), and the average annual precipitation ranges from 1220 to 1420 mm (48 to 56 in)."
