  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigpool series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks on nearly level high flood plains along major rivers. Permeability is moderately slow to slow. Slopes ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 50 to 54 degrees F., and annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 50 inches.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Adelphia, Blairton, Holmdel, Kensington, Trackler, Wharton, Whiteside, and Woodstown soils are in the same family. Fenwick and Tuscarawas series were competing under the old classification and are potential competitors pending assignment of cation-exchange activity class. Adelphia and Holmdel soils have olive hues and contain glauconite. Adelphia soils formed in glauconite bearing eolian and/or fluviomarine deposits.  Blairton and Fenwick soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to sedimentary bedrock. Holmdel soils have formed in unconsolidated marine or reworked marine deposits in which glauconite is common. Kensington soils formed in loess and Illinoian age or Wisconsinan age till.  Trackler soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum from fine-grained igneous rocks, predominantly rhyolite. Tuscarawas soils formed in channery colluvium and in residuum weathered from clayey acid shale. Wharton soils formed in residuum from interbedded clay shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone on uplands. Whiteside soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from materials weathered from felsic to mafic crystalline rocks. Woodstown soils formed in sandy marine and old alluvial sediments."
