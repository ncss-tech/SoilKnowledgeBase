Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid through out the pedon. Rock fragments content commonly ranges from 2 to 20 percent by volume in the solum, and 5 to 25 percent in the substratum. Rock fragments are mainly rounded gravel and cobbles of sandstone and shale.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 4 through 6, and chroma 3 through 8. Texture is commonly silt loam, but the range includes loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 through 6, chroma 4 through 6. Texture is commonly silt loam, but the range includes loam, and fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 4 through 6, chroma 3 through 8.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Adelphia, Blairton, Holmdel, Kensington, Trackler, Wharton, Whiteside, and Woodstown soils are in the same family. Fenwick and Tuscarawa series were competing under the old classification and are potential competitors pending assignment of cation-exchange activity class. Adelphia and Holmdel soils have olive hues and contain glauconite. Adelphia soils formed in glauconite bearing eolian and/or fluviomarine deposits.  Blairton and Fenwick soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to sedimentary bedrock. Holmdel soils have formed in unconsolidated marine or reworked marine deposits in which glauconite is common. Kensington soils formed in loess and Illinoian age or Wisconsinan age till.  Trackler soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum from fine-grained igneous rocks, predominantly rhyolite. Tuscarawas soils formed in channery colluvium and in residuum weathered from clayey acid shale. Wharton soils formed in residuum from interbedded clay shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone on uplands. Whiteside soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from materials weathered from felsic to mafic crystalline rocks. Woodstown soils formed in sandy marine and old alluvial sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bigpool soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks on nearly level high flood plains along major rivers,commonly 25 to 30 feet above the water line at normal summer flow. Slopes gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F., and annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 55 inches. Elevation ranges from 200 to 600 feet above sea level."

Combs soils are well drained and are commonly found on the stream levee position. The Dunning and Melvin soils are very poorly and poorly drained, and commonly found in the back water areas. Lindside soils do not have argillic horizons. Downsville, Monongahela, and Tyler soils are found on adjacent higher stream terraces."
