Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Ap and AB horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is clay or silty clay and in some places, silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 4 in the upper part and 4 or 5 in the lower part and chroma of 2 or less.  Iron masses have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons have thin horizons of coarser textured material.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or less. It is clay or silty clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Booker soils are on flood plains along major rivers or glacial lake plains. Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 1 percent, but range to 2 percent. These soils formed in thick clayey alluvium or clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Aholt, Blake, Bremer, Norborne, and Waldron soils. The Aholt soils are calcareous and occur on similar landscapes. Blake soils are fine-silty and occur on slightly higher landscape positions. Bremer soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and average less than 60 percent clay in the particle size control section. Norborne soils are less clayey and occur on slightly higher positions. Waldron soils occur on flood plains and average less clay in the particle size control section."

In most years, an apparent water table has an upper limit of +0.5 to 1.0 foot where very poorly drained from November to July, and 0.0 to 1.0 foot where poorly drained from November to June."
