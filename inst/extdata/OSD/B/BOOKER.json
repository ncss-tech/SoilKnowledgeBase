  "OVERVIEW": "The Booker series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvium on flood plains or clayey lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Ap and AB horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is clay or silty clay and in some places, silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 4 in the upper part and 4 or 5 in the lower part and chroma of 2 or less.  Iron masses have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons have thin horizons of coarser textured material.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or less. It is clay or silty clay."

Blake soils are fine-silty and occur on slightly higher landscape positions. Bremer soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and average less than 60 percent clay in the particle size control section. Norborne soils are less clayey and occur on slightly higher positions. Waldron soils occur on flood plains and average less clay in the particle size control section."
