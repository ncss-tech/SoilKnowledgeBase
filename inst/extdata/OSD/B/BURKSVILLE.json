  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development is 35 to 70 inches.  Loess thickness is more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 7 percent sand.  Sand content of the A and E horizons is less than 10 percent and includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions.  Exchangeable sodium, in concentrations of 5 to 15 percent, is in one or more subhorizons between depths of 10 and 40 inches.  An exchangeable sodium concentration greater than 15 percent is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons contain carbonates in the middle and lower parts of the argillic horizon and in horizons or strata below the argillic horizon.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap or A) has value of 3 or 4 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content is 12 to 27 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe second part of the control section (Eg) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content is 11 to 25 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe third part of the control section (Btng, and BCg, where present) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is dominantly silty clay loam, but includes silt loam in some subhorizons.  Clay content averages 27 to 35 percent in the upper part and ranges from 25 to 35 percent in the lower part.  Sand content is less than 7 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe lower part of the control section (Cg) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent and sand content is less than 7 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Burksville soils are on broad interfluves and nearly level summits on the Illinoian till plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in loess and contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 200 days, and elevation is 400 to 800 feet above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Blair, Bunkum, Marine, and Oconee soils and the poorly drained Cowden and Pierron soils do not have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil.  Blair and Bunkum soils are in the upper end of drainageways below the Burksville soils.  Cowden and Pierron soils are on similar landform positions and typically are intermingled with the Burksville soils.  Marine and Oconee soils are on similar nearly level and gently sloping parts of the landform nearby.  The somewhat poorly drained Coulterville soils are on more convex summits and in drainageways nearby.  The somewhat poorly drained Grantfork soils are in drainageways where the mantle of loess is thinner.  The poorly drained Piasa soils have a natric horizon and are in similar landform positions nearby."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were previously mapped as Coulterville Variant and Huey Taxadjunct soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this soil include:  Ochric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 13 inches (Ap and Eg horizon).  Albic horizon - from a depth of 7 to 13 inches (Eg horizon).  Argillic horizon - from a depth of approximately 13 to 54 inches (Btng1, Btng2, and Btng3 horizons).  Aquic conditions - periodic episaturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
