Capay soils are moderately well drained, have carbonates throughout the B horizon and formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale.  Ayers soils are well drained and are underlain by bedrock.  Maxwell soils have a Ca:Mg ratio of less than 2:1 and have hues of 5Y and 2.5Y."

Elevation is 115 to 195 feet, (35 to 59 m).  The mean annual precipitation is 21 to 25 inches, (533 to 635 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 61 to 62 degrees F, (16 to 17 degrees C).

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Busacca, Conejo, Galt, and Kusalslough soils.  Busacca soils are on distal fans, and lack intersecting slickensides.  Conejo soils are on fans and are fine-loamy.  Galt soils are in basins on terraces and are moderately deep to a duripan.  Kusalslough soils are on flood plains and lack intersecting slickensides, do not crack, and formed from flood deposits deposited over basin materials."

The soils are occasionally flooded for brief duration from December through March.  A fluctuating water table can occur at depths of 12 to 60 inches, (30 to 152 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through May.  Water occasionally to frequently ponds up to 6 inches, (15 cm) above the surface for brief duration from December through March."

(Ap, Bss)\nCambic horizon - 24 to 60 inches, (61 to 152 cm). (2Bk, 2Bw)\nSlickensides  8 to 24 inches (20 to 61cm) (Bss)\nParticle-size control section- 10 to 40 inches, (25 to 102 cm)\nSoil moisture control section- 7 to 19 inches, (18 to 48 cm).\nA lithologic discontinuity is thought to exist where fine-textured basin alluvium was deposited over older coarser textured fan alluvium.\nAltered hydrology: Dams and levees along the Sacramento River and its tributaries, drainage ditches and leveling for agriculture have altered the natural hydrology.  This alteration has modified the frequency and duration of saturation, ponding and flooding.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
