  "OVERVIEW": "The Barnetmine series consists of very shallow and shallow to bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived from granitoid. The Barnetmine soils are on north facing hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
