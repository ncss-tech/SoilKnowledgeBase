  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 11 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 50 degrees to 56 degrees F.  and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F. at any time. The soil is moist in some part from October until some time in August.  Moist in the summer is due, in part, from heavy fog and low evapo-transpiration rates. It is dry in all parts less than 45 consecutive days in August and September. Gravel averages 35 to 50 percent and base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2; 7.5YR 2/2 or 3/2. It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam and has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/2, 4/3, 4/2, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/4 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 2/2 or 3/2."
