  "REVDATE": "05/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bluesky series consists of very shallow and shallow to sandstone, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvial material derived from sandstone. Bluesky soils are on structural benches and on escarpments of mesas and cuestas. Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
