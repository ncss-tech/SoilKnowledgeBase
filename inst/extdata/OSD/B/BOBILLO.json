Aluf soils have sandy control sections with Bt horizons composed of lamella.  Catilla, Coving, Desan, Padina, Patilo, Silvern, and Vernia soils have annual average soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Coving soils have grayish mottles within 30 inches of the surface, and Silvern soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their control sections. Hitilo, Nueces, and Sarita soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods.  In addition, Nueces soils have grayish mottles within 30 inches of the surface and A horizons less than 40 inches thick.  Vernia soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their control sections."

The soil developed in sandy sediments in areas of the Carrizo Sand geologic formation.  The surface has been somewhat reworked by wind.  The climate is semiarid or dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 260 to 290 days and elevation ranges from 500 to 950 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 25 to 31."

All these soils, except for Aluf and Hitilo soils, have epipedons less than 40 inches thick.  Aluf and Hitilo soils occur at slightly higher elevations.  Aluf soils have lamellae in the Bt horizon and Hitilo soils are more acid.  All other soils occur at slightly lower elevations.  In addition, Tonio soils are calcareous and Webb soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon."
