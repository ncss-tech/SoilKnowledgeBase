  "OVERVIEW": "The Blakabin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from interbedded shale and sandstone.  Blakabin soils are on mountain side slopes and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The depth of the uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 16 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is clay loam, silty clay loam, or light clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout the profile and are sandstone and shale channers less than 3 inches in size.  These soils have continuous horizons of calcium carbonate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it has strong granular structure, but some pedons have moderate fine subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
