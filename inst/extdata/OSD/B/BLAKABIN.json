  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F; the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F.  The depth of the uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 16 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is clay loam, silty clay loam, or light clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout the profile and are sandstone and shale channers less than 3 inches in size.  These soils have continuous horizons of calcium carbonate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it has strong granular structure, but some pedons have moderate fine subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
