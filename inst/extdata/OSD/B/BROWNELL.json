The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The soil contains free carbonates throughout and is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is gravelly loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is very gravelly loam or very channery loam.  Coarse limestone or chalk fragments, 1/2 to 4 inches along the longer axis, range from 35 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 8 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.

Kipson, Nibson, Sogn, and Wakeen soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  In addition, Wakeen soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches; Kipson and Nibson soils have a paralithic contact at 10 to 20 inches; and Sogn soils have lithic contact at depths of 4 to 20 inches.  Heizer soils have lithic contact at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Lebo soils are in a wetter climate and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

The soils formed in local outwash derived from chalky limestone or residuum from the underlying limestone or chalk.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 34 to 42."

All these soils, except Heizer, contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments by volume.  In addition, Armo, Harney, and Mento soils lack bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Armo soils are on side slopes or foot slopes below Brownell soils.  Harney, Mento, and Wakeen soils are on less sloping upland divides.  Heizer soils occupy steeper side slopes or similar positions as Brownell soils."
