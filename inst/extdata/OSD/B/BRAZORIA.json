  "OVERVIEW": "The Brazoria series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments on the flood plains of the Brazos and Colorado Rivers. These gently to moderate sloping soils occur on flood plains of the Coastal Plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation range from 1092 to 1397 mm (43 to 55 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 to 21.7 degrees C (67 to 71 degrees F).",
