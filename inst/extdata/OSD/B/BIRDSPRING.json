  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Dozer soils have 18 to 35 percent clay and moist more than 20 days in the soil moisture control section from June through August. Saguaro soils are moist more than 20 days in the soil moisture control section from June through August and are typical of the Sonoran desert and MLRA 40. St. Thomas soils have mean winter temperature of 8 to 13 degrees C. (47 to 55 degrees F.). The upper part of the soil profile does not freeze during the winter. Umberci soils have 35 to 55 percent rock gragments in the particle-size control section and are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to September following summer convection storms."
