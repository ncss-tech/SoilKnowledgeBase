  "OVERVIEW": "The Badgerwash series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed tephra and outwash over outwash from volcanic rocks. Badgerwash soils are on outwash plains. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches (1143 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F (6 degrees C).",
