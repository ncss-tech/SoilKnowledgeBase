  "OVERVIEW": "The Beavercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly and cobbly loamy recent alluvial and colluvial sediments.  These soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans below steep to very steep hill slopes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
