  "STATES": "NC",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Brickhaven series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils with slow permeability. They formed in residuum from Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, and shale. These soils are on uplands of the Triassic Basin in the Southern Piedmont. Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F. near the type location.",

Depth to a lithic contact with unweathered bedrock (R) is greater than 60 inches.\nRock fragments are less than 35 percent by volume in the A or Ap horizon, less than 15 percent by volume in the E, Bt, and BCt horizons, and less than 35 percent by volume in the C horizon. Exchangeable aluminum is high (greater than 10 meq/100g). Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except where surface layers have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and where eroded, silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Some subhorizons may have a value of 3.  Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in the lower part of the Bt horizon of some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam. In some pedons, the upper Bt horizon may be loam or silt loam. The particle size control section averages more than 30 percent silt or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons may contain mottles in shades of yellow or brown. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in some pedons.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored, weathered Triassic siltstone, mudstone,\nconglomerate, or shale."

The moderately well drained Mooshaunee soils are fine-silty, moderately deep to Cr, and are in slight depressions, adjacent to drainageways, or at the heads of drains. Pinoka soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to R, and are on ridges and shoulder slopes. Mayodan and Creedmoor soils do not have a Cr horizon within 60 inches and are on ridges and hill slopes. The moderately well drained Polkton and White Store soils and\nthe somewhat poorly drained Green Level soils have very high shrink-swell potential and are on ridges and hill slopes. In addition, Polkton soils are moderately deep to a Cr horizon."

This soil is seldom used as cropland due to high aluminum concentrations and very low natural fertility.\nDiagnostic features and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 51 inches below the surface (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons).\nParalithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 51 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon).\nSIR = NC0143 MLRA = 136"
