    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSolum thickness ranges from 25 to 55 inches. Depth to paralithic contact with weathered bedrock (Cr) ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to a lithic contact with unweathered bedrock (R) is greater than 60 inches.\nRock fragments are less than 35 percent by volume in the A or Ap horizon, less than 15 percent by volume in the E, Bt, and BCt horizons, and less than 35 percent by volume in the C horizon. Exchangeable aluminum is high (greater than 10 meq/100g). Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except where surface layers have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and where eroded, silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Some subhorizons may have a value of 3.  Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in the lower part of the Bt horizon of some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam. In some pedons, the upper Bt horizon may be loam or silt loam. The particle size control section averages more than 30 percent silt or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons may contain mottles in shades of yellow or brown. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown may occur in some pedons.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored, weathered Triassic siltstone, mudstone,\nconglomerate, or shale."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Capshaw and Carbonton series in the same family. Capshaw soils have a solum thickness of 40 to 60 inches, a depth to limestone bedrock of 40 to 80 inches, and lack the high aluminum concentrations. Carbonton soils have Cr horizons within 20 to 40 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Brickhaven soils are gently sloping to moderately steep and are on ridges and hill slopes in the Triassic Basins of the Southern Piedmont. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic siltstone, mudstone, conglomerate, or shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 53 inches."

The well drained to moderately well drained Hallison soils are fine-silty and are in slight depressions, adjacent to drainageways, or at the heads of drains. The moderately well drained Mooshaunee soils are fine-silty, moderately deep to Cr, and are in slight depressions, adjacent to drainageways, or at the heads of drains. Pinoka soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to R, and are on ridges and shoulder slopes. Mayodan and Creedmoor soils do not have a Cr horizon within 60 inches and are on ridges and hill slopes. The moderately well drained Polkton and White Store soils and\nthe somewhat poorly drained Green Level soils have very high shrink-swell potential and are on ridges and hill slopes. In addition, Polkton soils are moderately deep to a Cr horizon."
