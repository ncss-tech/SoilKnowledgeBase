    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bunyard soils are on lake terraces. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. The ash is Holocene age and of dacite (acidic) composition. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,345 meters. The climate is semiarid and is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
