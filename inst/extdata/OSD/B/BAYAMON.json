    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is more than 60 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.  Quartz sand grains range from few to many throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Iron concretions range from none to common.\nThe A/B horizon, where present, is a mix of the Ap and Bo horizons.  It has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 or 6; or there is no dominant color and is a mix of the colors of the Ap and Bo horizons.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bo horizon has hues of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Iron concretions range from none to common in the upper part and generally decrease with depth.  Redoximorphic accumulations as coatings on ped faces in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common in the lower horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bayamon soils are in stable coastal plains and in valleys interspersed among the limestone hills (haystacks or pipino hills). They formed in fine-textured sediments of mixed origin.  The stability of the landforms enhances the weathering processes, the leaching of bases and weatherable minerals and the accumulation of more stable minerals and sesquioxides.  The climate is humid tropical. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 65 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F."

Almirante and Vega Alta soils are on  similar positions, have more than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite, and do not have Oxic horizons.  Matanzas soils are on similar positions but are deep to limestone bedrock.  Tanama soils are on higher positions of toeslopes and side slopes of the limestone hills.  In addition, they are shallow to limestone bedrock and do not have an Oxic horizon."
