  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Borco series was originally described as a drained phase of the Borah series.  However, because of artificial drainage the soil moisture regime has changed from aquic to aridic resulting in a different classification and a new soil series.  Although a Bk horizon is present in the Borco series it does not have enough soft powdery lime to qualify as a calcic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches (A, Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (2C1 and 2C2 horizons and part of the 2C3 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
