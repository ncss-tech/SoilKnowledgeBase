  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Borco series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Borco soils are on flood plains and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Borco series was originally described as a drained phase of the Borah series.  However, because of artificial drainage the soil moisture regime has changed from aquic to aridic resulting in a different classification and a new soil series.  Although a Bk horizon is present in the Borco series it does not have enough soft powdery lime to qualify as a calcic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches (A, Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (2C1 and 2C2 horizons and part of the 2C3 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
