  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 30 to 60 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is more than 80 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 16 to 30 inches. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 30 percent in the substratum. In some pedons a discontinuity between the colluvium and residuum is evident. Reaction of the solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 through 6. It is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt and B't horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. There are mottles with high and low chroma. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam.\nThe Btx horizon has colors similar to those in the Bt horizon. There are mottles with high and low chroma in most pedons. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8. There are mottles with high and low chroma in most pedons. It is commonly loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam but the range includes clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are theBuchanan, Calverton, Cookport, Ernest, Glenville, Kedron, and Raritan series in the same family and the Califon, Colfax and Trego series in associated families. Buchanan, Cookport, and Ernest soils contain sandstone and shale rock fragments. Calverton soils have a silty clay loam Bt horizon. Glenville soils are silt loam, channery loam or channery silty clay loam in the layer above the fragipan. Kedron soils have Btl horizons redder than 5YR or redder. Raritan soils contain water rounded gravel. Califon soils do not have low chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Colfax soils are in a thermic family and Trego soils have fragipans that are redder than 7.5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Belvoir soils are on nearly level and gently sloping upland depressions and footslopes and along intermittent drainageways. Slopes are dominantly concave. Gradients are typically less than 4 percent but the range includes up to 8 percent. These soils developed in colluvial and residual material weathered from crystalline rocks. The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 44 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 degrees to 59 degrees centigrade."

The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 4/91\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
