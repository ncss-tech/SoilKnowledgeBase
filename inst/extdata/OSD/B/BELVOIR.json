  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Belvoir series are very deep and somewhat poorly drained. They formed in colluvial and residual material weathered from crystalline rocks. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan layer. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 30 percent in the substratum. In some pedons a discontinuity between the colluvium and residuum is evident. Reaction of the solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 through 6. It is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt and B't horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. There are mottles with high and low chroma.

Buchanan, Cookport, and Ernest soils contain sandstone and shale rock fragments. Calverton soils have a silty clay loam Bt horizon. Glenville soils are silt loam, channery loam or channery silty clay loam in the layer above the fragipan. Kedron soils have Btl horizons redder than 5YR or redder. Raritan soils contain water rounded gravel. Califon soils do not have low chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Colfax soils are in a thermic family and Trego soils have fragipans that are redder than 7.5YR."
