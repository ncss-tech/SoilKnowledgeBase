The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 70 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The control section is 9 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent particles coarser than fine sand.\nDepth to a weakly cemented pan is 40 to more than 60 inches.  Some pedons have Btk horizons in place of the Bk horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. It is moderately acid, slightly acid or neutral.  It has 6 to 12 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
