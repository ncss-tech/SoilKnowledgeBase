  "OVERVIEW": "The Bergquist series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Bergquist soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
