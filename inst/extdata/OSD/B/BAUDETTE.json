  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Baudette series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits. These soils are on glacial lake plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 600 millimeters.",
