  "OVERVIEW": "The Bruffy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Bruffy soils are on slough channels and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.",
