  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F.  The upper portion of the Bt is commonly noncalcareous, but some pedons may be calcareous to the surface.   Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are typically less than 5 percent.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 20 to 35 percent.  Fifteen to 35 percent of the sand is coarser than very fine sand.  Structure is columnar parting to angular or subangular blocky.  Reaction is from strongly alkaline in the upper portion to very strongly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.  In some pedons below the particle-size control section or at 36 inches, sandy loams are common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Avar (CO), Firstview (CO), and Starlake (NM) series.  Avar soils have a natric layer with more than 35 percent clay and the base of the natric horizon is less than or equal to 10 inches below the surface.  In addition, they are underlain by buried horizons.  Firstview soils have lithologic discontinuities of clay at 20 to 36 inches.  Starlake soils have hues of 10YR and yellower in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bunkwater soils are on dissected upland plateaus and structural benches.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in aeolian deposits of mixed sources.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 9 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 90 to 150 days.  Elevation is 5,000 to 6,000 feet."

This revision updates the classification from an Ustollic Natrargid to an Ustic Natrargid.  (1994 Amendments to Soil Taxonomy).  Last updated by the state 3/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
