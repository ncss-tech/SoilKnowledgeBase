    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is ashy sandy loam or ashy loam. It has volcanic glass of 30 to 40 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.2 to 0.3. percent and moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Texture is ashy loam or gravelly ashy clay loam. It has volcanic glass of 10 to 20 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.2 to 0.3 percent.\nThe 3Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma 2 to 4 dry or moist. It is clay, clay loam, silty clay, gravelly clay or gravelly clay loam and averages 35 to 60 percent clay. The 3Bt4 horizon, when present, may range to more than 35 percent rock fragments. Base saturation (NH4OAC) is 75 to 95 percent.\nIn some pedons, a BC horizon is present."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bearrun soils are on mountains. Landscapes are typically hummocky reflecting past land flows of various magnitudes. They are formed in basalt colluvium with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Elevation is 2,150 to 4,900 feet. Slopes range from 3 to 55 percent. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 55 inches. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 40 to 100 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from 1 to 7 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 62 inches\nAbrupt textural boundary at 23 inches (between 2Bw2 and 3Bt1 horizons)\nPSCS - the zone from 23 to 43 inches (3Bt1 and part of the 3Bt2 horizon) with mixed mineralogy based on lab data.\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 1 to 23 inches based on lab data.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nThis series is classified as mixed, active based on lab data for the official type location. NaF pH is greater than 8.4 however 15-bar/clay ration is less than 0.6. The dominant concept used in correlation of similar ash influenced soils within this vegetative zone is isotic mineralogy. Laboratory data is available for similar soils supporting both the isotic and mixed mineralogy.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data for this pedon is available. NSSL pedon number 92P-23, sample number S91WA-077-008.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
