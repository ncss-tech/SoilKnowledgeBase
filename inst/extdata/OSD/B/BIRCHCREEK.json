Droem soils average less than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Leevan and Ravenswood soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section.  Leevan and Roostercomb soils do not include the upper part of the argillic horizon in the mollic epipedon.  McIvey, Threek, Urwil, and Yago soils are very deep.  Sharesnout soils have less than 25 percent rock fragments larger than 8 cm in the particle-size control section.  Tickville soils have a typic xeric moisture regime.  Wilpar soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Yeates Hollow soils are deep to lithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Birchcreek soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from mica schist and quartzite or from andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 55 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,710 to 2,140 meters in Idaho and ranges to 2,440 meters in Nevada.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 75 to 95 days."
