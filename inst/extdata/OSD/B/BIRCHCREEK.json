  "OVERVIEW": "The Birchcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from mica schist and quartzite or from andesite.  Birchcreek soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",

Droem soils average less than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Leevan and Ravenswood soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section.  Leevan and Roostercomb soils do not include the upper part of the argillic horizon in the mollic epipedon.  McIvey, Threek, Urwil, and Yago soils are very deep.  Sharesnout soils have less than 25 percent rock fragments larger than 8 cm in the particle-size control section.  Tickville soils have a typic xeric moisture regime.  Wilpar soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Yeates Hollow soils are deep to lithic contacts."
