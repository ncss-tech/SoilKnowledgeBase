Mountainville soils are dominantly stony, lack sandy textures, and have subhorizons that are very strongly alkaline.  Pagari, Povertyflat and Walsey soils have bedrock within 150 cm. Selti soils lack carbonate and silica cementation and have particle-size control sections dominated by stones."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Belmill soils were classified in the clayey-skeletal, montmorillonitic, frigid family of Durargidic Argixerolls.  In 1988, as a result of current temperature data, Belmill soils have been reclassified from frigid to mesic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (mixed) (A, Bt1, upper part of the Bt2 horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from about 8 to 48 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizon).\nCalcic subgroup - Soft powdery carbonates as coats on gravel in the zone 48 to 152 cm (2Bqk1, 3Bqk2 horizons).\nAridic feature - Aridic moisture regime bordering on Xeric.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from about 8 to 48 cm. (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
