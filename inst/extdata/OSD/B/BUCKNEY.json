  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to carbonates range from 14 to 24 inches.  Buckney soils typically are free of coarse fragments to a depth of 60 inches or more.  Some pedons have 8 to 18 inches of silty overwash.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand.  Reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.  An AC horizon is in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It typically is loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or loamy sand but commonly contains thin strata of silt loam or loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burkhardt, Dickman, and Estherville soils in the same family and the Landes soils.  Burkhardt soils contain 8 to 40 percent gravel in the 2C horizons and are deeper to carbonates.  Dickman soils have a thicker solum and are deeper to carbonates.  Estherville soils contain 10 to 35 percent gravel in the 2C horizon.  Landes soils have a thicker solum and are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Buckney soils are on the slightly raised areas of the nearly level bottoms along major river valleys.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent but are commonly 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in thick sandy and loamy alluvium.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 32 inches."

Blencoe, Cooper, Keg, and Salix soils have finer textures and are on slightly lower elevations on bottom lands.  Hanlon and Spillville soils have thicker mollic epipedons and are on lower-lying first bottom lands."
