  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone is 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the Oa horizon, slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the A and E horizons, and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Btg horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 or less; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Organic materials are composed mostly of decayed leaves, twigs, roots, and other sapric vegetative material.  Percent fiber ranges from about 5 to 15 percent rubbed and from 20 to 35 percent unrubbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, or their mucky analogs.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Iron depletions in shades of gray, and masses or iron accumulation in shades of brown, yellow or red range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Iron depletions in shades of gray, and masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, yellow or red range from none to common.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is composed of soft, weathered, fractured limestone that can be dug with difficulty with a spade, has very firm to extremely firm rupture resistance with low to high excavation difficulty.  It usually contains soft carbonate accumulations along with few to many hard limestone or chert fragments.  It is highly irregular and interspersed with solution holes that range from 4 to 12 inches in diameter and filled with sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil material.  Depth to limestone is variable within short distances.\nThe 2R horizon is composed of hard, unweathered limestone that has slightly rigid to very rigid rupture resistance with very high to extremely high excavation difficulty.  Some areas contain solution holes filled with Btg and/or Cr material."

Thin accumulations of organic materials are on the surface.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Additionally, Chaires soils have a spodic horizon and are on the flatwoods.  Meadowbrook soils have an argillic horizon at depths of greater than 40 inches.  Shired soils have a loamy A horizon, and Wekiva soils have an argillic horizon at depths of less than 20 inches and limestone at depths of 20 to 30 inches.  Meadowbrook and Shired soils are on the same landform.  Wekiva soils are on slightly higher positions."

However, this soil would better classify as a Histic Endoaqualfs if it were in Soil Taxonomy.\nProposal:\nPg. 83 IAJA2.  Other Endoaqualfs that have a histic epipedon.    Histic Endoaqualfs\nThese soils are ponded for 6 to 9 months during most years and are frequently flooded.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nHistic epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Oa horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 32 to 48 inches (Btg horizon).\nAquic conditions - endosaturation throughout.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
