The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F and summer temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 12 and 38 inches is usually dry in all parts from late July to late September and moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Base saturation is 17 to 25 percent and increases with depth.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 15 percent throughout the soil profile.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2 with moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2, 3/1, 2/2.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  Reaction is slightly to medium acid.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 5/3, 5/6, 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3.  Texture and reaction is similar to A horizon."

They also have a mean annual soil temperature of 45 to 47 degrees and are moist in the control section for about 8 or 9 months each year.  They also lack a paralithic contact within 80 inches and have a growing season of less than 100 days.  Haypress soils have a mollic epipedon."

The soils formed in material weathered from granitic rock.  The climate is typified by warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches, much of which falls as snow.

Waca and Windy soils have bulk density less than 0.91 gm/cc and the exchange complex is dominated by amorphous material.  Goodwin soils are loamy-skeletal."
