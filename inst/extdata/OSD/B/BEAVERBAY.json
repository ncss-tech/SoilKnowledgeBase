    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and in the argillic horizon. The content of sand coarser than very fine averages 15 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy alluvium, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium, and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the silty mantle, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the silty mantle and in the loamy alluvium. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in normal years.\nO horizon\nHue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or neutral\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 to 3\nTexture: a mat of partially to highly decomposed forest litter\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon\nHue: 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 to 3\nTexture: silt loam\nE horizon\nHue: 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR\nValue: 4 or 6\nChroma: 2 or 3\n(Colors of 4/3, 5/3, or 6/3 have dry value of 7 or more)\nTexture: silt loam\nBs horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 5\nChroma: 4\nTexture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam\nWhere the silty mantle is thin, some pedons have a 2Bs horizon with colors like the Bs horizon.

Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nBeaverbay soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation below the spodic horizon has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above. Clay content ranges from 8 to 17 percent.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon, has color and texture like the 2E horizon described above. The 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.  Loam texture occurs only immediately below the silty mantle.
