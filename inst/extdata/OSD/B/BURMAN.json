  "OVERVIEW": "The Burman series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  Burman soils are on fan terraces and basin rims.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
