    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 35 to 55 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Organic carbon content of the epipedon ranges from 0.6 to 4 percent, decreasing regularly with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 15 and is dry in some or all parts from July 15 to October 1 in most years.  Clay content averages 25 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 27 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Base saturation ranges from 70 to 80 percent (ammonium acetate).\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3 in the upper part.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  In the lower part it is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4 or 7/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/6 or 7.5YR 4/4.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and may be gravelly.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent, increasing with depth.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 95 percent (ammonium acetate)"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Bruhel soils occur on coastal hills and mountains and associated marine terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 50 to 1300 feet.  The soils are formed in material weathered from sandstone.  The climate is characterized by cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."

Dehaven, Hotel, Irmulco and Tramway soils are on coastal hills.  They occur out of the direct influence of salt laden ocean winds, have conifer vegetation and lack mollic epipedons.  Vizcaino soils occur near primary and secondary ridges and are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Flumeville and Windyhollow soils occur on marine terraces.  Flumeville soils have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, and have fine particle-size control sections.  Windyhollow soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches."
