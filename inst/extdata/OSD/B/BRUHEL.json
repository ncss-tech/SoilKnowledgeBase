  "OVERVIEW": "The Bruhel series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Bruhel soils are on coastal hills and mountains and associated marine terraces and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 15 and is dry in some or all parts from July 15 to October 1 in most years.  Clay content averages 25 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2 or 5/3.

The soils are formed in material weathered from sandstone.  The climate is characterized by cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."

Dehaven, Hotel, Irmulco and Tramway soils are on coastal hills.  They occur out of the direct influence of salt laden ocean winds, have conifer vegetation and lack mollic epipedons.  Vizcaino soils occur near primary and secondary ridges and are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Flumeville and Windyhollow soils occur on marine terraces.  Flumeville soils have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, and have fine particle-size control sections.  Windyhollow soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches."
