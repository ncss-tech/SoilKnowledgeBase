  "OVERVIEW": "The Bigwinder series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed on flood plains and low stream terraces.  They are forming in recent stratified alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 63 to 73 degrees F.  Organic matter content averages from 2 to 4 percent throughout the profile and decreases irregularly with depth. The particle size control section is highly stratified with thin to moderately thick lenses of sandy loam, loam, sand, very fine sandy loam and loamy sand but averages as fine or finer than loamy very fine sand.  It is typically sandy loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos throughout.   These soils have a seasonal high water at one to three feet from April through August in most years. Where mollic colors are present, they are not thick enough to be mollic epipedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AC horizon, when present, has the combined color properties of the A and C horizons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The horizon consists of thin strata averaging sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Textures are highly stratified with thin to moderately thick lenses of sand, loamy sand, loam, and sandy loams with an average texture of sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in stratified deposits derived primarily from sandstone.  Elevations range from 3600 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with over half falling in March, April, May, and June. In South Dakota these soils are mapped at elevations as low as 2000 feet and at precipitation as high as 18 inches.  These soils frequently flood for brief durations during spring months.  A water table is present at a depth of one to three feet in the months of April through August. The mean annual air temperature averages 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 105 to 130 days."
