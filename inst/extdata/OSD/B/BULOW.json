  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to coquina rock ranges from 42 to 60 inches and to more than 80 inches in the cavities of solution chambers.  Depth to the upper boundary of the Bt is 40 inches or more.\nReaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and from slightly acid to neutral in the Bw and Bt horizons.\nThe A or AP horizon has a salt-and-pepper appearance with many clean uncoated sand grains.  When rubbed, it has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or coarse sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Irregular streaks in shades of red and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Irregular streaks in shades of red and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.\nThe R horizon is composed of coquina rock which is typically porous limestone.  However, in places, there are beds of loose, unconsolidated coquina shells.  The rock is pitted at irregular intervals with nearly vertical cylindrical solution chambers that are generally about 1.0 foot in diameter but can range up to 2.0 feet.  They are filled with sandy and loamy soil material from the above horizons.  The soil horizons are roughly parallel to the surface of the rock except over the cylindrical solution chambers where the horizons are broken and irregular with tonguing of soil material into the solution chambers."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Hague soils are the only known series in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Jonesville series.  Hague soils are on similar positions, have the upper boundary of the Bt horizon between 20 to 30 inches, and are very deep.  Jonesville soils are superactive, are on similar positions, have the upper boundary of the Bt horizon between 20 to 30 inches, and are moderately deep to limestone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bulow soils are on low, narrow coastal sand ridges on the low coastal plain in central Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments underlain by differentially weathered coquina bedrock or layers of unconsolidated coquina shells.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

The excessively drained Astatula soils are very deep and sandy throughout.  Cocoa soils are moderately deep to coquina rock.  The excessively drained Paola soils are very deep and have weakly expressed spodic horizons.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and are Spodosols."
