  "REVDATE": "03/2005",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bulow series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils on low, narrow sand ridges in coastal areas.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments underlain by differentially weathered layers of coquina rock and, in places, unconsolidated layers of coquina shells.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes are dominantly less than 5 percent but range up to 8 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to coquina rock ranges from 42 to 60 inches and to more than 80 inches in the cavities of solution chambers.  Depth to the upper boundary of the Bt is 40 inches or more.\nReaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and from slightly acid to neutral in the Bw and Bt horizons.\nThe A or AP horizon has a salt-and-pepper appearance with many clean uncoated sand grains.  When rubbed, it has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or coarse sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Irregular streaks in shades of red and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Irregular streaks in shades of red and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.\nThe R horizon is composed of coquina rock which is typically porous limestone.  However, in places, there are beds of loose, unconsolidated coquina shells.  The rock is pitted at irregular intervals with nearly vertical cylindrical solution chambers that are generally about 1.0 foot in diameter but can range up to 2.0 feet.  They are filled with sandy and loamy soil material from the above horizons.  The soil horizons are roughly parallel to the surface of the rock except over the cylindrical solution chambers where the horizons are broken and irregular with tonguing of soil material into the solution chambers."

Hague soils are on similar positions, have the upper boundary of the Bt horizon between 20 to 30 inches, and are very deep.  Jonesville soils are superactive, are on similar positions, have the upper boundary of the Bt horizon between 20 to 30 inches, and are moderately deep to limestone bedrock."

The excessively drained Paola soils are very deep and have weakly expressed spodic horizons.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and are Spodosols."
