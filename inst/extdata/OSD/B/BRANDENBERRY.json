  "OVERVIEW": "The Brandenberry series consists of moderately deep to fractured hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on continental glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 40 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
