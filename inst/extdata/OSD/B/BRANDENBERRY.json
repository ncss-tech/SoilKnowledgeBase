Mean winter soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties and 50 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 20 to 50 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 15 to 25 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry and value and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.
