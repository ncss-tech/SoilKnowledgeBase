Arritola soils are non-calcareous above the duripan.  Chiara soils are non-calcareous above 7 inches and have a C horizon that has 20 to 60 percent brittle durinodes.  Coltroop soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments and no duripan fragments in the control section. Crooked soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser and are saline-alkaline.  Frohman soils have a thin, rippable duripan and bedrock is deeper than 40 inches.  Minveno soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Nevoyer soils have bedrock above 20 inches. Otoole soils are somewhat poorly drained and are strongly or very strongly alkaline. Peeko soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Plegomir, Scoon, Tenvorrd and Yahoo soils are greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock."
