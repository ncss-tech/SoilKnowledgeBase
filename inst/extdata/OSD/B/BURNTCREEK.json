  "OVERVIEW": "The Burntcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. They are on drainageways and flood plains. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
