  "OVERVIEW": "The Bandbox series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium over loamy-skeletal alluvium derived from sedimentary and quartzite parent rocks. Bandbox soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
