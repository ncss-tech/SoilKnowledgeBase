  "OVERVIEW": "The Bistineau series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments. These soils formed in late-Pleistocene age alluvium on stream terraces associated with the Red River and its tributaries. Slopes are dominantly less than 5 percent, but range to 8 percent. Average annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 46 inches near the type location.",

Attoyac soils have less than 30 percent silt in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon. Elrose soils are on uplands and formed in marine sediments high in glauconite. Caledonia soils are on older terraces not associated with the Red River and typically are darker red in the upper part of the subsoil. Darbonne soils are on uplands and formed in marine sediments that are high in siderite. In addition, they have 5 to 35 percent ironstone fragments in the particle-size control section. Petal soils are moderately well drained with a clayey discontinuity and a perched wet zone at 2.5 to 3.5 feet deep. Salisaw soils are on uplands in mountain valleys and have a gravelly discontinuity at 30 to 60 inches deep."

These data support a coarse-loamy family, however the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt/E1 horizons were resampled and analyses were run on those samples by LSU (S97LA-015-035), which support fine-loamy family.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
