Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4. Texture is very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Attoyac and Elrose series in the same family, and the Caledonia, Darbonne, Petal, and Salisaw series in closely related families. Attoyac soils have less than 30 percent silt in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon. Elrose soils are on uplands and formed in marine sediments high in glauconite. Caledonia soils are on older terraces not associated with the Red River and typically are darker red in the upper part of the subsoil. Darbonne soils are on uplands and formed in marine sediments that are high in siderite. In addition, they have 5 to 35 percent ironstone fragments in the particle-size control section. Petal soils are moderately well drained with a clayey discontinuity and a perched wet zone at 2.5 to 3.5 feet deep. Salisaw soils are on uplands in mountain valleys and have a gravelly discontinuity at 30 to 60 inches deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bistineau soils formed on convex stream terraces in late-Pleistocene age, loamy alluvial sediments from the Red River and its tributaries. Slopes dominantly are 1 to 5 percent, but range to 8 percent. The mean annual temperature near the type location is 65 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 46 inches. Annual frost free rainfall ranges from 25 to 30 inches."

The Forbing, Gore and Mckamie soils are on side slope positions along drainageways and are clayey throughout. Kolin soils are on the flatter landscapes and have aquic conditions within 30 inches of the soil surface. Morse soils are on sililar positions and are vertisols that formed in calcareous clayey alluvial deposits. Wrightsville soils are on broad depressional areas, are gray throughout and have a fine textured control section"

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Tilden and Amite series in the previously published Bossier Parish Soil Survey (8/62).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon\nOchric epipedon--------0 to 14 inches (A, E, BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon-------14 to 83 inches (Bt, Bt/E, 2Bt horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data are available for the type location pedon from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska (Survey Sample No. S94LA-015-012). These data support a coarse-loamy family, however the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt/E1 horizons were resampled and analyses were run on those samples by LSU (S97LA-015-035), which support fine-loamy family.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
