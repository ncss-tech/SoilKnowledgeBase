  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 34 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent gravel in the solum and from 10 to 35 percent gravel and cobble in the 2C horizon.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle size control section has a weighted average of less than 18 percent clay and greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction throughout the profile is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Texture is commonly silt or silt loam, but ranges to include loam and very fine sandy loam.  The Bw1 horizon has value and chroma moist of 3 or less.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist from 0 to 4.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or loam."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Blaquirre soils are on hill and mountain sideslopes on both the mainland and islands.  They are adjacent to major river deltas.  Blaquirre soils formed in a silty loess mantle overlying residuum from bedrock of various origins.  The climate is humid maritime. Average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 110 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 1500 feet."

McGilvery soils are well drained organic soils on steep sideslopes.  Mitkof soils are deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on concave slopes and in depressional areas."
