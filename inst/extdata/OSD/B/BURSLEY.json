The soil formed\nin a thin mantle of recent alluvium over mixed loess and late Pleistocene age terrace deposits.  Slope gradients are typically\nless than 1 percent, but range up to 3 percent.  The climate is\nwarm and humid.  The mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches\nand the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F near the\ntype location."
