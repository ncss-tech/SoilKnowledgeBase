    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral and increases with depth.  Shale and limestone rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and up to 50 percent in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is less than 7 inches thick if the moist color value is less than 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles or streaks of higher value and chroma are allowed in the lower part.  It is silty clay or clay with 45 to 60 percent clay and 4 to 8 percent sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4, and may have mottles or streaks in shades of brown and black.  It is silt loam through clay in the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Bland soils are in sloping to very steep uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in materials weathered from purplish red argillaceous limestone.  Rock outcrops are common on most areas.  These soils are very erosive and characterized by a type of erosion locally called \"slip erosion\" where fairly large areas of soil slide downhill exposing the bare rock.  Mean annual air temperature ranges between 50 and 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges between 38 and 45 inches."
