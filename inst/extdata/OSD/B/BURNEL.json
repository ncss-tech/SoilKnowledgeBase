  "OVERVIEW": "The Burnel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, drainageways, and foot slopes of hills.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
