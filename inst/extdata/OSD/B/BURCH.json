The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 to 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry. It has weak fine or medium granular structure.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry. It is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak prismatic or blocky structure.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.

Calpine soils are moderately acid or slightly acid throughout the particle-size control section and have faint clay films in pores and bridge between grains.  Cashmont and Surprise soils are 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Caphealy, Roloff and Roosevelt soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Snake Hollow soils are calcareous and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in the lower part of the control section.  Rio King soils are moderately well drained.  Shantown soils have 10 to 30 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

They formed in alluvium, primarily of sandstone origin.  These soils occur in a climate with hot dry summers and moist cold summers. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is 26 degrees F. to 28 degrees F., average July temperature is 72 degrees F. to 74 degrees F. and average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and average frost-free season is 145 to 190 days in Washington, and 100 to 120 days in Idaho."
