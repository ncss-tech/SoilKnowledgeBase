Outland soils are loamy-skeletal, are influenced by volcanic ash, and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Penstock soils are loamy-skeletal and have low base saturation.  Ulhalf soils are fine-loamy, are influenced by volcanic ash, have isotic mineralogy, and are deep to paralithic contacts."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of January 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Typic Palexeralfs.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 7 to 63 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 7 to 27 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and part of the Bt3 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location is sampled for the UC Davis Soil Morphology Lab.  In the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon the clay content is 34 percent in the Bt1 horizon, 39 percent in the Bt2 horizon, and 42 percent in the Bt3 horizon measured by the hydrometer method.  Base saturation data is available.  Base saturation is 71.8 to 79.5 percent in the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons by the UC Davis Soil Morphology Lab.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
