The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to sedimentary bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the discontinuity is 25 to 35 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent field estimated clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has an estimated 40 to 60 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is 15 to 25 percent clay and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boardflower soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep side slopes of mountains.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2600 to 3500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
