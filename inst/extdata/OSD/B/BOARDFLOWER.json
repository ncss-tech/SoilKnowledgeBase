  "OVERVIEW": "The Boardflower series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
