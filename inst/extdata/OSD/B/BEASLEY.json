  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to soft calcareous rocks is 40 to 60 inches or more.  Coarse fragments of chert, soft limestone, shale, or siltstone range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum, and from 0 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the upper solum, medium acid to moderately alkaline in the BC horizon, and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 and 5, and chroma of 2, 3, and 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  Some pedons have an A horizon less than 6 inches thick, with colors like the Ap, but include value of 3, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a silty clay loam or silty clay BA horizon, 3 to 8 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 and 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Most pedons have few to many mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow, and shades of gray in the lower part.  It is silty clay or clay.\nThe BC horizons of some pedons have 2.5Y hue, and is silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has matrix and mottle colors in shades of gray, olive, red, and brown.  It is clay, silty clay or in some pedons is silty clay loam.  The C horizons may be in either the residuum from the soft calcareous rocks or in colluvium derived from these rocks.  The soft bedrock has clay beds from 1 inch to more than 12 inches thick in some pedons."

Bledsoe, Brashear, Brookside, Hagerstown, Estate, Gunlock, Jessup, Lamoille, Newnata, and Woodsfield soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick. Briggsville soils formed in glacial lake basins and have lower annual precipitation and temperature.  Derinda soils have a loess mantle 15 to 30 inches thick, and have lower annual precipitation and temperature.  Eden soils have more than 10 percent coarse fragments in the B horizons.  Edenton soils have glacial material in the upper solum.  Elba soils have more than 10 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the B horizon.  Eldean soils have stratified sand and gravel at 20 to 40 inches.  Bucklick, Heitt, Kewaunee, Upshur, and Vandalia soils have hue of 5YR or redder in part or all or the B horizon.  Lowell soils have lithic contact at more than 40 inches.  Markland Vincent, and Medary soils formed primarily in glacial lacustrine sediments.  Miamian soils have loam or sandy loam C horizons at 20 to 40 inches. Bonnell, Losantville, Ozaukee soils formed primarily in glacial till.
