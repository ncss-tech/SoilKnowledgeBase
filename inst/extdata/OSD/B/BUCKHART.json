The well drained Elkhart soils have carbonates within depths of 102 centimeters (40 inches), are on similar parts of the landscape, and are also on sideslopes along drainageways. The somewhat poorly drained Ipava and Muscatune soils and the poorly drained Sable and Virden soils are on nearly level broad interstream divides on positions at lower elevations, and they form a hydrosequence with the Buckhart soils. In addition, the Ipava and Virden soils have a fine-textured particle size control section. The moderately well drained Newvienna soils are on similar positions on the landscape and have a thinner dark surface layer. The well drained Osco soils are on sideslopes along drainageways."
