Classification changed from udic argiustolls to udertic argiustolls based on laboratory samples.\n02/2016 BKN Updated intro to current standards. Added in metric units. Added clay content, sand content, and fragments to RIC. East facing, convex, 27 percent slope, and elevation of 400 meters was added to the typical pedon. Added quadrangle, latitude, longitude, and datum to type location. Changed geographic setting to tabular and added in landform, slope, elevation, precipitation pattern, MAAT, MAP, and FFD to geographic setting. Deleted competing series. Updated geographically associated soils by deleting Irwin, Kipson, and Sogn. Changed permeability to Ksat. Added LRRs and MLRAs to distribution and extent. Added particle-size control section and secondary carbonates to remarks. Added lab data to additional data.\n06/2020 BKN Added RIC for Btk horizon.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nAdditional data: Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory data is available for Pedon IDs 97KS161049 and 69KS161001.
