    "content": "REMARKS: Bacliff soils were formerly included with the Beaumont series.  More than 19,000 acres of this soil was mapped as a taxadjunct of the Beaumont series in Brazoria County, TX.  Classification changed from Entic Pelluderts to Aquic Hapluderts 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify hydrology and classification.\nDiagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - 23 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in) (Bg, Bssg1 and Bssg2 horizons)\nSlickensides - 89 to 203 cm (35 to 80 in) (Bssg horizons).\nAdditional Comments: None\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU characterization lab data on pedon S1965TX157090 (project ID NL400010).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
