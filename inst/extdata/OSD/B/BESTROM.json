  "OVERVIEW": "The Bestrom series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Bestrom soils are on glaciated uplands and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The volcanic ash mantle is 4 to 6 inches thick. Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 51 degrees F. The particle size control section has 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or silt loam. It has 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam and has less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.
