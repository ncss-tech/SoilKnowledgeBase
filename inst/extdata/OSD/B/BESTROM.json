The volcanic ash mantle is 4 to 6 inches thick. Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 51 degrees F. The particle size control section has 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or silt loam. It has 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam and has less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in glacial till with a thin mantle of volcanic ash and loess and are underlain by basalt or granitic bedrock. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 21 inches. Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 100 to 125 days."
