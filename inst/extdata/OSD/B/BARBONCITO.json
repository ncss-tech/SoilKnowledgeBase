  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barboncito series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately and moderately slowly permeable soils that developed in sandy eolian and slope alluvium from sandstone and shale deposited over sandstone.  Barboncito soils occur on hills, ridges, dipslopes of cuestas and summits of mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
