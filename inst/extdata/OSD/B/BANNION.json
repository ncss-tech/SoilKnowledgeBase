  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 66 to 71 degrees F.  The soil is dry for 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  It is usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 55 to 70 days out of the 120 days following June 21.\nDepth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 14 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments are dominantly pebbles but include some cobbles.  It is slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam with 15 to 45 percent rock fragments.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is mainly very gravelly loam and less commonly extremely gravelly loam.\nThe Bkq horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam with 35 to 80 percent rock fragments.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  The Bk or Bkq horizons may be absent in some pedons but both are not absent in any pedon."

These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Deerlodge and soils occur on nearly level fan terraces at slightly lower elevations.  Garbo soils do not have a duripan and occur downslope on fan remnants."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches.  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon - a zone of carbonate accumulation from a depth of about 9 to 27 inches. (Bk and Bkq horizon)\nDuripan - an indurated lime and silica hardpan occurring at a depth of 20 to 40 inches (Bkqm horizon).\nXeric feature - the soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering Xeric.\nThe thickness of the duripan and the materials underlying the pan need to be further defined for this series.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".  The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
