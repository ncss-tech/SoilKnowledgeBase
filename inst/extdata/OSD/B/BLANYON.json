  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 6 to 40 inches and is not shallower than the upper 2 inches of the Bt horizon. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches. Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 10 to 40 inches, but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons. ESP either remains constant or increases with increasing depth ranging from 0 to 15 percent in the solum but exceeding 15 percent in the Ck horizon in some pedons. The control section of some pedons has few faint mottles with chroma of more than 2 in both matrix and mottling. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above 40 inches and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is typically silty clay or silty clay loam but ranges in clay from 35 to 60 percent, silt from 15 to 55 percent, and sand from 5 to 45 percent with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR. It is typically silty clay or silty clay loam but clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent, silt from 15 to 55 percent, and sand from 5 to 45 percent. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from about 3 to 14 percent."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Blanyon soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans, terraces, and in drainageways. Slopes typically range from about 0 to 20 percent or more. The soils formed in thick, calcareous, moderately fine to fine textured materials derived principally from sedimentary bedrock. At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months. Mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 46 degrees F."
