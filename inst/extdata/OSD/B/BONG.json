    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bong soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. These soils formed mainly in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations are 1,500 to 3,700 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, relatively dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches; average January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; and average July temperature is about 68 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

Donavan soils are coarse-loamy and are on glaciated foothills. Garrison soils are loamy-skeletal and are on outwash terraces. Hudnut and Kartar soils have an ochric epipedon, are coarse-loamy, and are on outwash terraces. Marble soils have an ochric epipedon, are sandy, and are on dunelike terraces. Phoebe soils have a pachic epipedon, are coarse-loamy, and are on outwash terraces."
