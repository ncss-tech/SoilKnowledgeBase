  "OVERVIEW": "The Brooke series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with low saturated hydraulic conductivity formed in residuum weathered from fractured limestone. Slope ranges from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1000 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 1.0 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 45 to 99 centimeters. Depth to lithic contact ranges from 51 to 99 centimeters. Coarse fragments of limestone and soft shale range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 30 percent in the B horizon, and 5 to 50 percent in the C horizon. They may make up as much as 40 percent of individual subhorizons of the B horizons. Reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline in the A and B horizons, and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, with values and chroma of 3.5 or less. A2 or A3 horizons have hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, values of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. The A horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe B horizon has hues mostly of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 3 through 5, anc chroma of 3 through 8. Some pedons have hues of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Color variegation included hue of 5Y, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 and may occur within subhorizons of the B horizon in some pedons. The B horizon is silty clay or clay.\nThe C horizon has hues mostly of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The C horizon is silty clay or clay. Most pedons have lithochromic mottles in the C horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Basco, Belpre, Caleast, Fleming, McAfee, and Salvisa series are in the same family. The Basco, Belpre, Caleast, and Fleming soils lack a lithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches; in addition, the Basco soils have textures of silt loam and silty clay loam in the upper part of the B2t horizon and the Belpre soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the solum. The McAfee soils have a subhorizon in the B2t with hue of 5YR. The Salvisa soils typically have low chroma mottles in the lower of the Bt horizon but the 10YR Cynthiana. Lowell, Opequon, Tumbez, and Upshur series are in related families. Chilhowie, Cynthiana, Lowell, Opequon, Tumbez, and Upshur series are in related families. Chilhowie soils have more than 60 percent clay and depth to bedrock does not exceed 25 inches. Cynthiana and Opequon soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface. Lowell soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock. Tumbez soils lack an argillic horizon and have materials with more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent immediately below the surface layer. The Upshur soils have hues redder than 7.5YR and have lighter colored A horizons, and have a paralithic or lithic contact at depths greater than 40 inches."

They are formed in residuum weathered from limestone or interbedded limestone and calcareous shales. The climate is humid temperature with average annual rainfall of 36 to 50 inches and average annual temperature of 50 to 57 degrees F."

The Clarksburg, Gilpin and Westmoreland soils all have less than 35 percent clay in the texture control section. The Guernsey soils have mottling with chromas of 2 or less in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS: Brooke soils are currently only correlated in 5 Soil Survey areas in MLRA 126 that are all over 40 years old and in need of revision.  All recent soil survey work within the last 20 years in areas that had Brooke mapped has recorrelated these soils to Lowell or small areas of Faywood. The Brooke series is a candidate for deactivation.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (Ap horizon).\nb. Argillic horizon--the zone from 23 to 56 centimeters. (Bt horizon)\nc. Lithic contact-- 97 centimeters. (top of R horizon).\nPrevious revision dates: 5/77"
