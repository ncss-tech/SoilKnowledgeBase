  "OVERVIEW": "The Brinker series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and influenced by diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits.  Brinker soils are on lake plains and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
