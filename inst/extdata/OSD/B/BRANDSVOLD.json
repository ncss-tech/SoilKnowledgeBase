    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is commonly ranges from 11 to 36 inches.  A thick solum phase is recognized where the depth to carbonates and the base of the argillic ranges up to 54 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.   The argillic horizon has 18 to 27 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 2 to 12 percent by volume of the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 to 2 moist.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 10 to 20 percent and the sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 2 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 0 to 3 moist.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  Clay films range from few to many and from faint to prominent.  Reaction is typically moderately acid to neutral but may be mildly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 0 to 3 moist.  It is fine sandy loam, loam and sandy loam.  The non-carbonate clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent and the sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  Carbonates are disseminated throughout or are in the form of common to many threads and masses.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 to 4 moist.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy loam.  The C horizon has 10 to 18 percent non-carbonate clay and 45 to 65 percent sand.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
