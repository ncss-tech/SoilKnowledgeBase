Helendale soils are on nearby fan remnants and have an argillic horizon within 25 centimeters of the mineral soil surface. Hypoint soils are on alluvial fans, do not have an argillic horizon and have a sandy particle size control section. Oldwoman soils are on fan remnants, have a calcic horizon as well as an argillic horizon and are loamy-skeletal in the particle size control section. Silvermine soils are on fan remnants, are very shallow to a weakly cemented duripan and are sandy throughout the particle size control section."
