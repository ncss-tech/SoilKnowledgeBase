  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bobbitt soils are on escarpments, canyons, and basalt plains. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt with an influence of loess and volcanic ash. Elevations range from 1,900 to 3,200 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent, but most are more than 35 percent and occur on southerly exposures. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 33 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Blinn soils are on north, east, and west aspects, and have a frigid temperature regime. Dorb soils are on north aspects and have a thick volcanic ash mantle. Lacy soils are on south-facing ridges and are shallow to a lithic contact."
