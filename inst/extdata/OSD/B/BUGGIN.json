The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.  Hard, unweathered rock is within 25 inches of the soil surface.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 3 to 8 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 50 to 80 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 mm diameter) pebbles.  Lithology of fragments are granitic rocks such as granodiorite.\nA1 horizon - Value: 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 1 or 2 moist.\nOrganic matter content: 5 to 8 percent.\nReaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.\nA2 horizon - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nOrganic matter content: 3 to 6 percent.\nTexture: Very gravelly loamy coarse sand or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.\nReaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.\nBw horizon (when present) - Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam or very gravelly loamy coarse sand.\nClay content: 8 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments: 50 to 80 percent.\nReaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Buggin soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 11,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Sofgran soils are very deep with a paralithic contact at 60 to 80 inches.  Temo soils are sandy and have less than 60 percent base saturation in all horizons."
