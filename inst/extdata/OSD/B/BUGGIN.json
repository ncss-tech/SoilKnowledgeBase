  "OVERVIEW": "The Buggin series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Buggin soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.  Hard, unweathered rock is within 25 inches of the soil surface.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 3 to 8 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 50 to 80 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 mm diameter) pebbles.  Lithology of fragments are granitic rocks such as granodiorite.\nA1 horizon - Value: 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 1 or 2 moist.\nOrganic matter content: 5 to 8 percent.\nReaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.\nA2 horizon - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nOrganic matter content: 3 to 6 percent.\nTexture: Very gravelly loamy coarse sand or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.\nReaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.\nBw horizon (when present) - Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam or very gravelly loamy coarse sand.\nClay content: 8 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments: 50 to 80 percent.\nReaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid."
