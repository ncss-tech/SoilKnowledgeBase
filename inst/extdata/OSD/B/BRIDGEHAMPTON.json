  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 56 inches and corresponds closely to the depth to contrasting glacial drift. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 10 feet.  Rock fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the solum.  Stony pedons have 5 to 15 percent cobbles and stones in the solum.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 70 percent by volume in the substratum and are mostly gravel.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt. Structure is weak subangular blocky or the lower part of the horizon is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Some pedons have faint or distinct mottles.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt.  Structure is weak subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B'w horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have faint or distinct mottles. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Many pedons have high chroma iron stains on rock fragments in the upper part of the horizon.  Fine-earth texture ranges from sandy loam through sand.  Sandy loam and loamy sand are typical textures in glacial till materials and loamy sand and sand are typical in stratified glaciofluvial materials.  The horizon is massive or single grain, and is loose, very friable, or friable.  Some pedons have thin firm layers."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hitchcock, Poocham, and Unadilla series. Hitchcock, and Poocham soils have a solum thickness less than 40 inches thick. Unadilla soils have a reaction class that typically is neutral and ranges to slightly alkaline in the substratum and also do not have a bisequal horizon sequence, Bw-E-B'w in the subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bridgehampton soils are nearly level to steep and are on outwash terraces, plains, and upland glaciated landforms. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent, but commonly are 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in thick silty deposits underlain by stratified sand and gravel or coarse-textured glacial till.  Parent materials are derived mainly from gneiss, granite, and schist rocks with some sandstone, conglomerate, and shale.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 135 to 195 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broadbrook, Canton, Charlton, Enfield, Hartland, Haven, Narragansett, Rainbow, Raynham, Scio, Tisbury, Unadilla, and Wapping series on nearby landscapes.  All of these soils do not have a Bw-E-B'w horizon sequence in the subsoil.  Additionally, Broadbrook and Rainbow soils have a thinner solum and a dense substratum.  Canton, Charlton, and Riverhead soils are coarser-textured.  Raynham soils are poorly drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately well drained. Surface runoff is slow to rapid.  Permeability is moderate in the silty solum and moderately rapid to very rapid in the coarse-textured substratum.  Because of the strongly contrasting texture of the substratum, the solum is commonly saturated in the lower part in the winter, spring, and after heavy rains."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Much of the acreage is used for cultivated crops, hay, and pasture.  Common crops are potatoes and silage corn.  Some areas are used for sod farming and for nursery stock.  A few areas are in community development or are wooded.  Common trees are red, white, and black oak, white ash, red maple, white pine, and red pine."
