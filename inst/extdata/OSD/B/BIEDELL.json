  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known competing series in this family and subgroup.  Closely related series are the Kerber, Hooper and San Luis soils.  Kerber soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Hooper soils lack the high water table and low chroma redox features in the solum.  San Luis soils are fine-loamy over the sandy or sandy-skeletal 2C horizon and average less than 27 percent clay."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:\nOchric epipedon: from 0 to 3 inches (E horizon)\nNatric horizon:  from 3 to 27 inches.  (Btn1, Btn2 horizons)\nSecondary carbonate accumulations: from 27 to 32 inches (Bkn horizon)\nLithologic discontinuity: at 32 inches (upper boundary of the 2C horizon)\nEndosaturation and redox features: in the 9 to 27 inch layer and below; this pedon is presumed to be have saturation but not aquic conditions (no chemical reduction)\nParticle-size control section: from 3 to 23 inches (upper 20 inches of the natric horizon)\nThe 01/2012 revision changes the drainage class from poorly to somewhat poorly, and attempts to clarify the saturation characteristics. The original depth to saturation was loosely defined as \"within a meter\". This was revised to \"24 to 40 inches\" to be consistent with the Saguache Area published survey. It is unclear whether this saturation has accompanying chemical reduction, and would consequently be aquic conditions. At the current time, it is assumed chemical reduction is not significant above a depth of a meter.  The 01/2012 revision removed the \"g\" suffix from the Btn2 and Bkn horizons. It remains unclear why the saturation depth was originally given as 2 to 3 feet in the Saguache report, yet redox features are described as shallow as 9 inches in the typical profile.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
