  "OVERVIEW": "The Bedell series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Bedell soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
