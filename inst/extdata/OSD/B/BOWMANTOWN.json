  "STATES": "TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowmantown series consists of nearly level to sloping, very deep, moderately well drained soils. They occur on base slopes and nose slopes, and on interfluve summits capped with alluvium (mostly remnants of dissected stream terraces) in the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys (MLRA 128). These soils formed in a layer of colluvial or alluvial sediments weathered from interbedded sedimentary rocks and the underlying limestone residuum. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to limestone bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 inches). The content of chert or quartzite gravel typically ranges up to about 2 percent in all horizons, but a few pedons range up to 10 percent in the A, AB, and BA horizons, and to about 20 percent in subhorizons of the Bt and 2Bt horizons. The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid, except the A, AB, and BA horizons range to neutral in areas where the soil has been limed. A seasonal high water table is present beginning at a depth between 30 and 75 cm (1 to 2.5 feet). Downward water movement is slowed across the contact between the transported layers and the underlying residual soil that has a higher clay content and slower permeability. This lithologic discontinuity typically occurs below about 75 cm (30 inches) but is higher in the soil profile in some areas.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 10YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, if present, have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. The texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Few to common iron depletions occur in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. The texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Redoximorphic features (iron depletions and iron accumulations) are present in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and red.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8. The texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Lithochromic mottles are present in some pedons in shades of red, brown, and yellow. Few to many iron depletions and/or iron accumulations are present in most pedons, especially in the upper part of the horizon. They are in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and red."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They occupy foot slopes, base slopes, nose slopes, and interfluve summits capped with alluvium (mostly remnants of dissected stream terraces). Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Elevation ranges from 330 to 585 meters (1,100 to 2,000 feet). These soils formed in a layer of colluvial or alluvial sediments weathered from interbedded sedimentary rocks, and the underlying limestone residuum. Mean annual air temperature is 12.7 to 13.5 degrees C (54.9 to 56.3 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 1,041 to 1,168 mm (41 to 46 inches)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as the Pace series in older soil surveys of Washington and Greene Counties, TN. Pace is an inactive soil series for which interpretations have not been maintained. The Bowmantown series is product of field studies conducted on these soils over several years. The range in characteristics is based on field data from 88 representative pedons. Five representative pedons will be sampled and submitted to the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory for characterization.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - zone from 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 inches - A and AB horizons).\nArgillic Horizon - zone from 43 to 200 cm (17 to 79 inches - Bt1 through 2Bt4 horizons).\nRedoximorphic features - iron depletions and iron accumulations in the Bt1 through 2Bt4 horizons.\nLithologic discontinuity - at 89 cm (35 inches) where the alluvium contacts the underlying residuum.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
