They have a water table that fluctuates from 30 to 40 inches for the remainder of the year. Depth to mottles is 30 to 40 inches. Coarse fragments make up 0 to 10 percent of the solum. The mean annual soil temperature is 41 degrees to 45 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or less.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Mottles are district to prominent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Some pedons are weakly cemented by lime and have common 2 to 5 mm manganese oxide shot."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium mainly from acid igneous rocks. Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,000 feet. The climate is Humid continental, cool summers (Trewartha's modified Koppen system) with moist, cold winters and dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is from 12 to 16 inches. Average January temperature is 15 degrees F.; average July temperature is 66 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 39 degrees to 42 degrees F. Frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
