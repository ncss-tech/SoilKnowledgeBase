  "OVERVIEW": "The Brailsford series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from acid igneous rocks. Brailsford soils are on low alluvial terraces in concave depressions and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
