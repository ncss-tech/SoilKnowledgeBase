Bannel soils formed in aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material from Mt. St. Helens present in Bannel soil profiles is (1) fresh ash and pumice including the 176-year-old \"Layer T, (2) pumice of the 400-year-old \"Layer W\", (3) ash, pumice and scoria of the 2,500-year-old \"B set\", (4) ash and pumice of 3,000-year-old \"P set\", and (5) pumice of the 3,500-year-old \"Layer Y\": and in some profiles coarse sand size ash front Pine Creek pyroclastic flow ash cloud.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 115 to 130 inches.  Average January temperature is 30 degrees F; average July temperature is 61 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 4 inches and  a cambic horizon from 10 to 50 inches.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section is assumed to be more than 60 percent vitric material throughout.  From the mineral soil surface to 4 inches qualifies as ashy (A1 and A2), from 4 to 10 inches qualifies as ashy-pumiceous (2Bw1), and from 10 to 40 inches qualifies as medial (3Bw2, 3Bw3 and 3Bw4).  The ashy particle-size class was determined using a weighted average of 0 to 40 inches with no contrasting classes recognized.\nFurther investigation is needed as to the 15-bar moisture content of the \"B\" set ash and pumice layer (3Bw2, 3Bw3, 3Bw4) to determine whether the typical weakly smeary sandy loam textures qualify as medial.  Other geographically associated soils having been formed in the same \"B\" material are now classified as medial.  This tephra set should be handled the same wherever found.\nClassificaiton changed 6/98 based on 1998 Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  This soils was classified as aa ashy, frigid Typic Vitrandepts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
