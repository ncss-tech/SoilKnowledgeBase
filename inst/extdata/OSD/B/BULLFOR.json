These soils formed in sand sheets over mixed alluvium with a large component from volcanic rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 2,000 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is arid with cool winters and hot dry summers, typical of the Mojave Desert.  Distribution of precipitation is relatively even with slight peaks in January and August.  The mean annual precipitation is about 3 to 9 inches; mean annual temperature is about 58 to 64 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 210 to 250 days."
