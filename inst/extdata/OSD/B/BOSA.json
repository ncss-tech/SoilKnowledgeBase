  "REVDATE": "05/2006",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Bosa series consist of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that form in residuum, colluvium, and mixed slope alluvium from igneous rock.  Bosa soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 69 degrees.",
