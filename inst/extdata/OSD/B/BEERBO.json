  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brown and Brownrigg series. Brown soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section, have C horizons above the paralithic contact, and do not have paralithic materials of weathered metamorphic rock in the series control section. Brownrigg soils have secondary carbonates or calcareous C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from gneiss, schist, and altered granitic rocks. Elevations are 5,000 to 7,020 feet. The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and occasional summer convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on ustic. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches; mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
