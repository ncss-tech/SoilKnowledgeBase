  "OVERVIEW": "The Burke series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils formed in loess and glaciolacustrine deposits over a duripan on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to the Bk horizon is 4 to 36 inches.  The Bk horizon has less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  They have value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  The duripan is 6 inches to several feet thick and overlies weakly consolidated alluvium, lake sediments, loess, gravelly alluvial deposits, or basalt.\nThe A horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons.\nThe Bk horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dolman, Minidoka, Nyssa, Sluka, and Stanfield series in the same family and the Koehler, Prineville, and Taunton series. Dolman soils are 14 inches or greater to carbonates.  Prineville, and Taunton soils are coarse-loamy.  Koehler soils are sandy.  Minidoka soils have a Bk horizon with 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Nyssa soils have have average annual soil temperature of 49 to 51 degrees F. and are greater than 13 inches to carbonates.  Sluka soils have 12 to 18 percent clay in the control section and have more than 20 percent durinodes above the pan. Stanfield soils have a decrease in exchangeable sodium from the upper 10 inches to the underlying horizons and have strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline zones above the duripan."

They are in an arid climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  Mean January temperature is 30 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 73 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 135 to 200 days."
