  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Broncho soils are on terraces and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  They formed in mixed alluvium, dominantly from quartzite, limestone, and sandstone materials.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 1,600 to 4,500 feet."

Broxon soils have contrasting particle-size control sections at moderate depths and are calcareous to the surface. Chedehap soils are coarse-loamy and have loose sand at moderate depths.  Declo soils are coarse-loamy and are calcareous to the surface.  Paniogue soils have contrasting particle-size control sections at moderate depths.  Bahem, Broxon, Declo, and Paniogue soils are on the flatter terrace summits.  Chedehap soils are on narrow ridges on alluvial terraces."
