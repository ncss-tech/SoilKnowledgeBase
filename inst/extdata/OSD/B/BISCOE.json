    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Biscoe soils were originally proposed under the name Callistone soils.  Because of the similarity to the Callison series name, the name was changed.  Biscoe soils were formerly included with Callison and Cid soils in mapping. Callison and Cid soils are moderately well drained and Cid soils have a fine particle-size control section and are deep to hard bedrock.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20\ncentimeters (about 0 to 8 inches) (A and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 58 centimeters (about 8 to 23 inches) (Bt and Btg horizons)\nAquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction within 7 to 58 centimeters (about 3 to 23 inches) of the surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 200 centimeters ( about 79 inches) of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone (episaturation)\nRedox concentrations--the zone from 7 to 58 centimeters (about 3 to 23 inches)\nRedox depletions with chroma 2 or less--the zone from 7 to 58 centimeters (about 3 to 23 inches)\nParalithic contact--soft bedrock contact at a depth of 58 centimeters (about 23 inches)\nParalithic materials--the zone from 58 to 104 centimeters (about 23 to 41 inches) (Cr layer)\nHard bedrock--bedrock contact at a depth of 104 centimeters (about 41 inches) (R layer)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 104 centimeters (about 0 to 41 inches)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are not available at this time.
