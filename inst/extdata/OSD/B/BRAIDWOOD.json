  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The individual subhorizons within the C horizon are variable in thickness. The content of rock fragments in the control section ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel, but a few cobbles and channers are present. Cleavage planes and vertical fractures in the C horizon are due to stress impacted on the unweathered silty clay loam glacial till material. The series control section is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A or AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam or silt loam. Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.\nSome pedons do not have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4 (see remarks). It is stratified loam, silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand. Clay content of individual subhorizons ranges from 3 to 27 percent. The fine sand to coarse sand content ranges from 18 to 80 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Braidwood soils are on gently sloping to very steep summits and sideslopes of reconstructed landscapes on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. These soils formed in materials that were excavated during surface and underground mining operations. They formed primarily in calcareous, moderately coarse textured outwash material with or without a small amount of unweathered silty clay loam till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (48 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 171 to 311 meters (560 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ade, Bloomfield, Granby and Watseka soils on adjacent lower, unmined areas on outwash plains. The somewhat excessively drained Ade and Bloomfield soils are on nearly level to gently sloping mounds or elongated ridges. The poorly drained Granby soils are in low lying or depressional areas. The somewhat poorly drained Watseka soils are on nearly level positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped as M.L. (made land), M.D. (mine dump), or S.M. (strip mine) in Will County. These areas were mined for coal, by both underground and surface mining methods. Mining took place before reclamation laws were in effect. Chroma of 2 or less in the C horizon is characteristic of previous formation and not current genetic soil development. The name Braidwood is from the town of Braidwood in southwestern Will County, Illinois.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 inches) (A and AC horizons); udic moisture regime.\n03/2020 Updated Taxonomic Class based on Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data for the typical pedon, S97IL-197-048, is available from the NSSL, Lincoln, Nebraska.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
