  "OVERVIEW": "The Blacksheep series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, alluvium or colluvium from sandstone.  Blacksheep soils are on sedimentary plains, ridges, escarpments and hills.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.",
