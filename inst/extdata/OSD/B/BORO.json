Tongues of A material extend into the C horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has 5Y or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay or clay.  It averages between 45 to 60 percent clay, with high content of silt.  It typically has few accumulations of carbonate.\nThe Bk horizon has 5Y or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 or 6 and 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay.  It typically has common to many accumulations of carbonate.\nThe C horizons have 2.5Y or 5Y hue, values of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay.  Accumulations of carbonate and gypsum crystals typically range from few to many.  Depth to shale is greater than 60 inches, however past correlations have recognized shale at 40 to 60 inches as phases."

Boyd, Labu, Lakoma, and Opal have shale between depths of 20 and 40 inches and are on similar landscapes.  In addition, Boyd and Opal soils have a mollic epipedon.  Kyle, Millboro and Promise soils are on plane to concave slopes below the Boro soils in the landscape. Carter soils are in swales and on nearly level terraces below the Boro soils and have a mollic epipedon and an argillic horizon.   Dupree, Okaton and Sansarc soils are on steeper, more dissected landscapes and have shale between depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Witten soils are in swales and have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick."
