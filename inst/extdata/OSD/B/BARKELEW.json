Barkelew soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and 3 to 5 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 moist, with chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Textures are very cobbly or cobbly clay loam or loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Textures are extremely stony loam or clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam."
