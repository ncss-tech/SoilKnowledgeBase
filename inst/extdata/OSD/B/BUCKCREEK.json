  "OVERVIEW": "The Buckcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and basalt colluvium mixed with small amounts of volcanic ash.  Buckcreek soils are on uplands and have slopes of 45 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth of basalt is 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 when dry and chroma of 1 or 2 when dry.\nThe BA horizon, when present is silt loam, cobbly silt loam or cobbly silty clay loam.  It has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It has value of 3 or 4 when dry and chroma of 1 or 2 when dry.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 when dry, chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and 2 to 4 when dry.  It has 20 to 30 percent gravel and 25 to 40 percent cobbles.  Structure is moderate to strong."
