The control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 when dry and chroma of 1 or 2 when dry.\nThe BA horizon, when present is silt loam, cobbly silt loam or cobbly silty clay loam.  It has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It has value of 3 or 4 when dry and chroma of 1 or 2 when dry.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 when dry, chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and 2 to 4 when dry.  It has 20 to 30 percent gravel and 25 to 40 percent cobbles.  Structure is moderate to strong."
