  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Barfan series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from ash flow tuff with an admixture of calcareous loess.  Barfan soils are on rock pediments and low hills.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
