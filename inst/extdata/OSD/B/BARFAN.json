  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Barfan soils are on rock pediments and low hills.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from ash flow tuff with an admixture of calcareous loess.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
