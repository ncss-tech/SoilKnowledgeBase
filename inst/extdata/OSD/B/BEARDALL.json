  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Some pedons have a thin organic layer at the surface. Depth to bedrock ranges from 24 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 36 degrees to 42 degrees F.  and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 54 degrees to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizons has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam, has 20 to 30 percent gravel and is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is gravelly silt loam with 20 to 30 percent gravel and is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has dominant hue of 7.5YR, ranging to 5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 5. It ranges from silty clay loam or clay loam to very gravelly silty clay loam. Pebbles and cobbles average less than 35 percent. This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline, and is 12 to 20 inches thick.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is flaggy, very flaggy or very stony silt loam, loam or silty clay loam. This horizon has 40 to 70 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Beardall soils are on mountain slopes below glacially modified limestone ridges, at elevations of 8,500 to 10,000 feet. Slopes range from 35 to 80 percent. Mainly north-facing. These soils formed in glacial-colluvial material weathered from quartzite, chert, sandstone and limestone. Mean annual temperature is 36 degrees to 42 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 52 degrees to 58 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 20 to 50 days. Average annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches."
