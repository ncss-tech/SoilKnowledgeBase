  "OVERVIEW": "The Bonnet series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from mixed metamorphic rock sources and limestone.  Bonnet soils are on alluvial fan and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 1 to December 20 and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 1 to November 25.  The soil between the depths of 10 and 30 inches is dry from July 1 to October 15 in most years (100 to 110 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  About 5 to 15 percent of the gravel is subrounded limestone fragments.  Depth to lime ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon is brown grayish brown or dark grayish brown 910YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2).  Moist colors are black, very dark brown, very dark gray, very dark grayish brown or dark brown (10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/2).  It is sandy loam, loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly loam with 5 to 35 percent pebbles.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe upper C horizon is brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, light olive brown, pale brown, very pale brown, or pale yellow (1YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4; 2.5Y 5/4, 6/4, 7/4).  Moist colors are dark brown, dark yellowish brown, brown, or olive brown (10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/4).  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam and has less than 18 percent clay.  It has 35 to 60 percent fine and medium gravel.  The amount typically increases with increasing depth.  It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent and has segregated secondary lime in filaments, seams or as lime coatings on the underside of pebbles.  The lime coatings range from 0.5mm to 3mm thick.\nThe lower C horizon has the same color ranges as the upper C horizon but is loamy sand, sandy loam, or loam and is extremely gravelly with 60 to 80 percent rock fragments."

Alpowa soils are dry for 70 to 90 consecutive days, have mostly silt loam texture, and have formed in material with a large component of loess.  Copperton soils have a weakly or moderately cemented horizon at depths of 12 to 30 inches.  Elquist soils have a silt loam or loam A horizon with a large component of loess and lime at a depth of 8 to 14 inches.  The Cca horizon has 16 to 25 percent calcium carbonate.  Hupp soils have a cambic horizon and have 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Lakewin soils have a cambic horizon and have a very gravelly sand IIC horizon at a depth of 17 to 27 inches.  Middle soils have a cambic horizon and are 20 to 40 inches deep over hard limestone."

The soils formed in alluvium mostly from mixed metamorphic rock sources but include some limestone.  Most rock fragments are smooth and subrounded and consist of schist, shale, graywacke and siltstone.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,500 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 15 to 22 inches.  Mean January temperature is 33 to 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Dotta, Duzel, Facey, Gazelle, Jilson and Stoner soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Also, all except Gazelle and Stoner have an argillic horizon.  Gazelle soils have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches and Stoner soils have an ochric epipedon."
