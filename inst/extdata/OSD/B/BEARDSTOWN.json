  "OVERVIEW": "The Beardstown series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy materials on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11.7 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches).",

Cantril and Riceville soils have more clay in the lower part of the solum and are formed in till. Conover, Metamora, and Romulus soils have sola less than 102 cm (40 inches) in thickness, and contain free carbonates at about the same depth as solum thickness. Dundas soils average more than 30 percent clay in the control section. Manheim soils contain a high content of black shale fragments in the upper part of the sola. Monitor soils contain from 5 to 30 percent gravel within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Schley and Skyberg soils have a 2B horizon formed in glacial till and are not stratified in any part above a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Darroch and La Hogue soils have a mollic epipedon. Whitaker soils have moist color value of 4 through 6 in the Ap horizon."

Ambraw soils are Fluvaquentic Haplaquolls. They are on flood plains or low terraces below the Beardstown soils. The very poorly drained Gilford soils are on nearby level or depressional parts of outwash plains and lake plains below Beardstown soils. Millbrook soils have a fine-silty argillic horizon and are on similar parts of the landscape nearby.
