  "OVERVIEW": "The Bofecillos series consists of very shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt bedrock. Bofecillos soils are on mountains, hills, and plateaus and have slopes of 1 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The precipitation falls mostly as intense rain during afternoon convective thunderstorms from June through September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  The frost free period is 210 to 250 days and the elevation is 3,500 to 5,500 feet."
