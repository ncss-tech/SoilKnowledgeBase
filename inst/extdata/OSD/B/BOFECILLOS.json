  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Bofecillos soils are on mountains, hills, and plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt bedrock.  Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The precipitation falls mostly as intense rain during afternoon convective thunderstorms from June through September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  The frost free period is 210 to 250 days and the elevation is 3,500 to 5,500 feet."

Horsetrap soils occur on similar landforms and formed in similar materials, but have a calcic horizon. Pantak soils occur on similar landforms, but formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from igneous rocks, and have an argillic horizon.  Ohtwo soils developed in colluvium deposited below escarpments, are very deep, and have a cambic horizon."
