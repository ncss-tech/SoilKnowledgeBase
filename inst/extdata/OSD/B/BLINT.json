These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 25 inches.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 23 to 33 percent clay and 40 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The A2 horizon is very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  The upper part is very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam.  The lower part is extremely cobbly silt loam, extremely gravelly loam, or very cobbly clay loam."

Fleener soils have 5YR and 7.5YR hues, NaF pH of 8.6 to 9.0 and are 25 to 40 inches to stones or boulders.  Hehe soils have 10 to 25 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand, and are dry 60 to 90 days after the summer solstice, and are 20 to 40 inches to weathered bedrock.  Lainand soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact.  Leidl soils have a mollic epipedon 10 to 18 inches thick and are dry for 75 to 90 days.  Norod soils are 25 to 38 inches to secondary carbonates and are dry to 100 to 120 days following the summer solstice.  Skooker soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact and are dry for 60 to 90 days."

These soils formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface over basalt colluvium.  Elevation is 2,500 to 3,300 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Average January temperature is 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is 69 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 135 days."
