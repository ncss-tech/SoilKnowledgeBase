  "OVERVIEW": "The Border series includes light-colored Noncalcic Brown gravelly soils occupying terraces, alluvial fans and footslopes.  The soils have formed under comparatively low rainfall and grass and sagebrush cover.  In position and mode of formation they resemble the Aspen soils but may be distinguished by their lack of lime, heavier textured more compact upper subsoils, and less porous substrata.  They differ from the Avon soils, which also occupy fans and footslopes, in being characteristically noncalareous and in the much higher proportion of gravel and cobbles and much lower proportion of fine material in subsoils and substrata.  They are similar to the Hobble soils (tentative series) of the Provo-Goshen Valley Area, Utah.",
