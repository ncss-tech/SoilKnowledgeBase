  "OVERVIEW": "The Befar series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from shale.  These soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 4 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",
