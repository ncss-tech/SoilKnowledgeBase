Biedsaw soils do not have gypsum and due to the variegated nature of the parent material, have Ck horizon hues of 2.5Y through 10R. Bone soils have a consistent salic horizon and crusted surface. Gayhart and Gaynor soils have paralithic contacts between 20 and 40 inches."

The mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year with about 55 percent falling between April and September.  July, August and September are the wettest months, with April, May and June being the driest.  Elevation is 6,000 to 6,600 feet.  Freeze-free period is 100 to 120 days."
