  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev.KDS-AGG",
  "REVDATE": "02/2011",
  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Braham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a sandy glacial outwash or eolian mantle and underlying calcareous, loamy till.  These soils are on moraines.  They have rapid permeability in the upper mantle and moderate to moderately slow permeability in the underlying till.  Slopes range from 6 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches at the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates ranges 27 to 60 inches.  The upper mantle is 20 to less than 40 inches thick.  Rock fragments, by volume, range from 0 to 10 percent gravel in the upper part and 2 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the underlying till. A gravelly lag line up to 5 inches thick may occur at the contact of the upper mantle and the till.  Rock fragments range to 35 percent, by volume, in this horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Cultivated areas include a color value of 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy coarse sand.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. In uncultivated areas the A horizon is 1 to 5 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Thin lamellae may occur in this horizon.\nSome pedons have a thin B/E, 2B/E, E & Bt, or 2E/B horizons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.   The clay content averages more than 18 percent.  The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Carbonate threads or masses are common to many.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with loamy or silty textures.\nThe 2C horizon (when present) has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The moist bulk density is 1.4 to 1.6 g/cc. Redox features with chroma of 1 to 4 are present."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Akeley, Andrusia, DeMontreville, Leaflake, Pomroy and Redeye series. Akeley soils have sandy mantles thicker than 40 inches over lacustrine sediments. Andrusia soils formed entirely in medium and coarse sands and have less than 20 percent clay in the argillic horizon. DeMontreville soils have hues that are 7.5YR or redder in the argillic horizon, are dominated by medium and coarse sands and have less than 18 percent clay. Leaflake soils have underlying glacial till less than 18 percent clay. Pomroy and Redeye soils have argillic horizons with less than 18 percent clay and have formed in dense till with very slow permeability."
