  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the particle size control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  The ratio of coarse silt to fine silt ranges from 1.25 to 2.50 in the silty mantle.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy lower subsoil.  Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and 0 to 10 percent in the sandy outwash.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.  Free carbonates are absent to a depth of 80 inches.  Redoximorphic concentrations are within a depth of 40 inches.  Redoximorphic depletions are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon in some pedons. Saturation occurs within a depth of 40 inches at some time in most years.  Periods of saturation are caused by restricted internal drainage associated with contrasting porosity at the sandy outwash contact.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have a A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.   The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nBlackriver soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Some pedons with a B/E horizon do not have a Bt horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt (2Bt horizon in pedons without a loamy 2Bt horizon) horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy 2Bt horizon) has color like the 3Bt horizon described above.  It is typically stratified layers of sand or coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly.  It averages more than 85 percent sand in the fine earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Campia, Dobie, Doritty, Nunica, Otterholt, and Wickware soils. A similar soil is the Ribriver series. Campia, Nunica, and Wickware soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section.  Doritty soils have less than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Dobie soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone at 20 to 40 inches.  Otterholt soils have a densic contact with till within the series control section.  Ribriver soils are Oxyaquic Glossudalfs that have an apparent seasonal water table within 40 inches of the surface for longer than 30 days duration in normal years."

Both soils are on lower landscape positions associated with apparent water tables, or are adjacent to moraines.\nThe moderately well drained Brander and Brill soils, the somewhat poorly drained Poskin soils, and the poorly drained Rib soils are on nearby landscapes with Blackriver soils where the silty mantle is less than 40 inches thick. Brander and Poskin soils are on lower landscape positions associated with apparent water tables, or are adjacent to moraines.  Brill soils are on similar landscape positions.  Rib soils are in depressions and drainageways."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is slow or medium.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy substratum. Blackriver soils have a perched seasonal water table above the sandy outwash contact at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet. Saturation within a depth of 40 inches has duration of up to 1 month at some time during the period of March to May in normal years.  Saturation below a depth of 40 inches has duration of 1 month or more during the same period. Internal drainage is restricted by contrasting pore size at the sandy outwash contact, resulting in a perched zone of saturation in the silty and loamy mantle during wet periods."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of this soil has been cleared and is used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay.  Some areas are in woodland.  Native vegetation is northern hardwood forests with scattered conifers.  Second growth of sugar maple, American basswood, northern red oak, yellow birch, quaking aspen, big tooth aspen, white ash, and black cherry is common at present time."
