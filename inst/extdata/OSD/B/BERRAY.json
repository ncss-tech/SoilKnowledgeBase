  "OVERVIEW": "The Berray series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
