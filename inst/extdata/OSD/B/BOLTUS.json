  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise noted the entire range of properties permissible for the subgroup and family in which the series has been placed applies to the series as well.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Weighted average gypsum content of the control section ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos in the control section.  Continuous subhorizons of genetically concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate should not occur within the control section although visible calcium sulfate and/or carbonate occurs throughout the control section as a natural feature of the parent materials.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent and coarse fragments ranging from 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter predominate.  Mottling within the control section not due to segregated lime may range from no mottling to a few fain mottles but if the soil is consistently mottled the base chroma of the matrix material must be more than 2.  The control section should be uniform with only minor stratification.  Color of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 5 to 7 dry or 3 to 6 moist, and in chroma from 2 to 4.  Reaction normally ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Hue of the C horizon ranges from 5Y to 7.5YR.  Reaction normally ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Texture is usually a loam or silt loam ranging to clay loam or silty clay loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series presently in this subgroup and family.  Similar and related series include the Chipata and Coaldraw series.  The Chipata series differs in lacking the high content of gypsum, in having mixed mineralogy, and in being in a mesic family.  The Coaldraw series differs in being coarser textured with less than 35 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Boltus series occurs on gently to steeply sloping upland hills and ridges.  Slopes typically range from 2 percent to about 40 or more percent.  The soil is developing in thin, calcareous, gypsiferous materials weathered from gypsiferous shales.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 8 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F., mean summer air temperature is 65 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F."
