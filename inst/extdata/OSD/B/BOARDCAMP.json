  "OVERVIEW": "The Boardcamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 2540 millimeters (100 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
