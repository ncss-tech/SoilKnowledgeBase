  "OVERVIEW": "The Blackspar series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from quartzitic sandstone and conglomerate.  Blackspar soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
