  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Baldknob soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of glacially scoured foothills and mountains.  These soils formed mainly in colluvium and residuum from rhyolite and andesite, with a minor component of glacial till.  The upper part of the soil also contains a mixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 670 to 1675 m (2,200 to 5,500 feet).  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 380 to 610 mm (15 to 24 inches). The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Johntom soils are on mountain ridges and are mesic. Northstar soils are on mountain ridges. They are mesic and are 50 to 100 cm (moderately deep) to a lithic contact. Thout soils are on glaciated mountain sides and are 50 to 100 cm (moderately deep) to a lithic contact."
