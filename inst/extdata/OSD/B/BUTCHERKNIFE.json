Borunda soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock.  They are on convex erosional hillslopes and pediments.  Chilicotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are on alluvial fans.  Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are on gently sloping Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains."
