The soils formed in fine textured residuum and alluvium derived from tuffaceous materials of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches, with most occurring from July to September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

Beewon and Quadria soils have argillic horizons and are on mid-Pleistocene pediments and are higher in the landscape.  Borunda soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock.  They are on convex erosional hillslopes and pediments.  Chilicotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are on alluvial fans.  Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are on gently sloping Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains."

Overland flow may occur once in 7 to 20 years for a duration of less than 2 days.  When overland flow occurs it is usually in the months of July through September."

Gypsum content determined by the water loss method of Nelson, Klameth and Nettleton, 1978, SSSA Journal 42: 659-661\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 30 to 41 inches (BCkyz horizons)\nUstic feature - The moisture control section is dry in all parts for less than three-fourths of the time (cumulative) when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is 5 degrees Centigrade or higher, and has an aridic moisture regime that borders on an ustic moisture regime\nSuperactive cation activity class - CEC to percent clay ratio is 0.60 or greater.  This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals in the Duff and Pruett Tuffs, and laboratory data from similar soils in Presidio County, Texas.\nThese soils were previously included in the Verhalen series\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nUpdate and revision for the recorrelation of Brewster County, TX, Main Part, 2/8/08, CEM.\nRevised for the correlation of Presidio County, Texas ; Oct, 2012, WWJ\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
