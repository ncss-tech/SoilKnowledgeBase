  "OVERVIEW": "The Brinnum series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in silty over sandy alluvium derived from mixed rocks. These soils are on lake plains and basin floor remnants. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
