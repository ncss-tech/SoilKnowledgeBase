Slopes are dominantly 15 to 45 percent and range from 5 to 60 percent. The Beaumain soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, tuff and other extrusive igneous rocks. The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F (14 to 18.3 degree C). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches ( 406 to 508 mm) and occurs mainly as thundershowers in July and August and rains in December and January. The frost-free period is 150 to 210 days."
