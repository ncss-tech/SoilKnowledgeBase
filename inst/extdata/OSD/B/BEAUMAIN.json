  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Beaumain series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basic igneous rock. Beaumain soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F (16 degrees C).",

Slopes are dominantly 15 to 45 percent and range from 5 to 60 percent. The Beaumain soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, tuff and other extrusive igneous rocks. The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F (14 to 18.3 degree C). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches ( 406 to 508 mm) and occurs mainly as thundershowers in July and August and rains in December and January. The frost-free period is 150 to 210 days."
