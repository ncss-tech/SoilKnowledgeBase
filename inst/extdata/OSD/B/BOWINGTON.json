  "OVERVIEW": "The Bowington series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone. Bowington soils are on flood plain steps. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
