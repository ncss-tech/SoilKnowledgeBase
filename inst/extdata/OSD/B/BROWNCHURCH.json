NAD 83.\nType location lat long was wrong, MLRA SS Leader sent a corrected lat long to the MO on 10/30/2008.  However; that corrected location is in the woods on a southeast facing slope, so it seems that is still not correct so the MO used its historic type location which puts this pedon on a NW slope in a cultivated field."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 15 centimeters.\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 15 to 157 centimeters.\nBrownchurch soils are recognized below backslopes where the sandstone is a significant factor in creating the loamy slope alluvium. The Churchtown series occurs in the same landform position in nearby areas where the sandstone has less influence and are fine-silty. Redox features in the lower part of the profile are relict or an indicator of a zone of near saturation of short duration during wet periods. The internal drainage appears to be restricted by structure differences in the lower part of the argillic horizon and 2BC or 2C horizon. Brownchurch soils, however, are considered to be well drained.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None available.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
