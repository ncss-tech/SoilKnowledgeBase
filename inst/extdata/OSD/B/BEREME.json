  "OVERVIEW": "The Bereme series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from sandstone. Bereme soils are on hills and canyons of islands. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F. (17 degrees C.)",
