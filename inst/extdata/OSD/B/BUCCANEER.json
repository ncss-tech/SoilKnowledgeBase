  "OVERVIEW": "The Buccaneer series consists of very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick deposits of clayey sediments of marine origin. These soils are in well defined drainageway, broad, nearly level swamps and low hammocks on flood plains. They are flooded for six months or more during most years. Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The only series in the same family is the Armenia series. It differs by being in a different landform and forming from basic residual rock. Other competing series are the Bayboro, Brookman, Cape Fear, Carwile, Jeanerette, Morey, Muldrow, Samba, Santee, and Stono. Bayboro, Brookman, Cape Fear, and Samba soils have umbric epipedons. Carwile and Mildrow soils are dry for longer periods of time. Jeanerette and Morey soils have fine-silty particle size control sections. Santee soils have mixed mineralogy. Stono soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils are on low marine terraces from 5 to 25 feet above sea level. They formed in clayey marine sediments, which in places is underlain by calcareous materials at depths ranging from 4 to 15 feet below the surface. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 57 inches."

Ellabelle soils occur in similar positions and have loamy argillic horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the soils surface. Meggett, Chaires, and Goldhead soils occur on slightly higher elevations. Meggett and Goldhead soils have ochric epipedons and Chaires soils have spodic horizons."
