The soil is strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon; medium acid to mildly alkaline in the Btg horizon and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Cg horizon. The particle - size control section has 35 to 55 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3. It is clay loam, sandy clay or clay.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon is typically a part of the mollic epipedon. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3. The lower part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Mottles and streaks in shades of gray, red, brown, yellow or olive are in the lower part of most pedons. The texture is clay or sandy clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y, 5G, and 5GY, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, or it is neutral with value of 5 or 6. It typically has mottles and streaks in shades of olive and gray."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The only series in the same family is the Armenia series. It differs by being in a different landform and forming from basic residual rock. Other competing series are the Bayboro, Brookman, Cape Fear, Carwile, Jeanerette, Morey, Muldrow, Samba, Santee, and Stono. Bayboro, Brookman, Cape Fear, and Samba soils have umbric epipedons. Carwile and Mildrow soils are dry for longer periods of time. Jeanerette and Morey soils have fine-silty particle size control sections. Santee soils have mixed mineralogy. Stono soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Buccaneer soils are in narrow to broad, well-defined drainageways, swamps and low hammocks on flood plains of the coastal plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils are on low marine terraces from 5 to 25 feet above sea level. They formed in clayey marine sediments, which in places is underlain by calcareous materials at depths ranging from 4 to 15 feet below the surface. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 57 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the similar Brookman series. In addition are the Ellabelle, Meggett, Chaires, and Goldhead series. Ellabelle soils occur in similar positions and have loamy argillic horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the soils surface. Meggett, Chaires, and Goldhead soils occur on slightly higher elevations. Meggett and Goldhead soils have ochric epipedons and Chaires soils have spodic horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; very slow runoff; very slow permeability. The water table is within 12 inches of the soil surface for 6 months or more in most years. Areas in the drainageways are flooded frequently and the low hammocks are flooded rarely during the summer months."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: In the drainageways the vegetation is cabbage palm, red maple, cypress, willow oak, sweetgum, water tupelo, waxmytle, dwarf palmetto, and sawgrass. In low hammocks the vegetation is loblolly pine, water and laurel oak, red maple, cabbage palm, southern magnolia, waxmytle, dwarf palmetto and sawgrass."
