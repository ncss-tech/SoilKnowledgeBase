  "OVERVIEW": "The Blanfort series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over alluvium derived from calcareous sandstone. Blanfort soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
