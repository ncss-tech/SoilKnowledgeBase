Austin soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact of chalky limestone.  Bolar, Carbengle, Sunev, and Venus soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Nuff, Bolar and Carbengle soils have sola less than 40 inches thick. Lewisville soils have mixed mineralogy.  Lott soils lack calcic horizons. Denton soils have a lithic contact at a depth between 40 and 60 inches."

The soil formed in calcareous silty and clayey sediments of Miocene age mainly of the Lagarto formation.  The climate is warm subhumid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F.and precipation ranges form 35 to 43 inches.  Frost free days range from 240 to 270 days and elevation ranges from 300 to 600 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices ranges from 48 to 64."
