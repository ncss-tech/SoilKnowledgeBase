The paralithic materials below the contact are tuff-breccia, conglomerate, or tuff.\nVolcanic glass content: 60 to 95 percent, mainly as glass shards in the coarse silt through fine sand fractions.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 15 to 25 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments is pyroclastic and similar volcanic rocks such as cinders or obsidian.\nA horizons\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist. A dry value of 6 is only in the upper 5 cm in some pedons and the upper 18 cm when mixed has a dry value of 5.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nOrganic matter content: 1 or 2 percent.\nBw horizon\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nClay content: 10 to 18 percent.\n2C horizon\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nClay content: 10 to 18 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Boltz soils are on plateaus. They occur on north-facing shoulder and backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from andesitic tuff-breccia, conglomerate, and similar pyroclastic or volcaniclastic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,770 to 2,125 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
