  "OVERVIEW": "The Boltz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from andesitic tuff-breccia.  Boltz soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
