  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to a lithic contact in sandstone ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid throughout.  Some pedons do not have a Cr horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  A horizons with color value less than 3.5, are too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  This horizon is fine sandy loam or loam.  A stony phase that has stones covering 0.01 to 3 percent of the surface is recognized.  Individual stones are about 1 to 8 meter apart.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or their gravelly analogues.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. A series in a similar family is the Ramsey series.  Ramsey soils are subactive, and are wetter in the moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Also, Ramsey soils have an E horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Basehor soils are on erosional uplands, usually adjacent to local drainageways.  Slopes are plane or convex with gradients that range from 3 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in loamy residuum from noncalcareous, fine-grained sandstone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 38 inches.  Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 58 to 68."

Mandeville, Sibleyville, and Vinland soils are on similar positions.  Nodaway soils are stratified and are in the adjacent drainageways.  Sharpsburg and Shelby soils have mollic epipedons and are on higher positions mantled by till or loess."
