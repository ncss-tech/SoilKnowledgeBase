  "OVERVIEW": "The Bellota series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well and moderately well drained soils formed in material weathered from weakly to moderately consolidated andesitic tuffaceous sediments overlain by alluvium from mixed rock sources. Bellota soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.",

Pentz (backslopes) and Peters (toeslopes) soils do not have a duripan and have a paralithic contact at 25 to 50 cm. Pardee soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and occur on summits of ridges that are erosion remnants of alluvial plains, and in areas with cobbly colluvium derived from upslope alluvial deposits."
