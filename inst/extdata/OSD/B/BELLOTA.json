  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Bellota soils are on footslope positions on hillslopes at elevations of 40 to 105 meters. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent and are commonly concave. These soils formed in material weathered from consolidated andesitic tuffaceous sediments overlain by colluvium derived from remnant terrace alluvium of mixed origin. Climate is Mediterranean with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 400 to 450 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C; average January temperature is 7 degrees C, and the average July temperature is 25 degrees C. The frost-free period is 250 to 275 days."

Keyes soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and a duripan at less than 50 cm. They are on fans, terraces and low hills with mound-swale microrelief. Pentz (backslopes) and Peters (toeslopes) soils do not have a duripan and have a paralithic contact at 25 to 50 cm. Pardee soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and occur on summits of ridges that are erosion remnants of alluvial plains, and in areas with cobbly colluvium derived from upslope alluvial deposits."
