  "OVERVIEW": "The Bielenberg series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from granitic and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, mountains, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
