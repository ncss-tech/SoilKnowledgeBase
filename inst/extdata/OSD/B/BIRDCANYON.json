  "OVERVIEW": "The Birdcanyon series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite. Birdcanyon soils are on fan aprons. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C.",

Atina, Azulgar and Toquop soils contain secondary calcium carbonate. Bluepoint soils are calcareous and formed from eolian material. Brazito, Bluepoint, Cajon, Copia, and University soils are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section July through September. Copia soils also do not have a hue of 10YR. University soils are calcareous. Koehn soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 18.1 to 22 degrees C. Maynard Lake soils contain more than 20 percent volcanic ash or pumice and are calcareous. Moapa soils are moderately deep to calcareous sandstone bedrock. Pintura soils have a hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. Yturbide soils have secondary calcium carbonate in the lower profile and receive maximum precipitation in the summer."
