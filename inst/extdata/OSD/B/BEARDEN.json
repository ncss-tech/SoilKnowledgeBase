  "OVERVIEW": "The Bearden series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately to slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous silt loam and silty clay loam lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on glacial lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam but some is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay.  The A horizon contains 1 to 10 percent carbonates.  Some pedons have tongues of A horizon extending into Bk horizon.\nThe ABk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 5 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It contains 15 to more than 30 percent carbonates.  Most of this is disseminated.  Some pedons contain few or common, faint to prominent redoximorphic features in this horizon.  Some pedons have Bky or BCk horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In some pedons below 30 inches the hue is neutral and the chroma is 1 or less.  The texture of the C horizon typically is silty clay loam or laminated silt loam and silty clay loam.  In some pedons below a depth of 40 inches the textures range from gravelly coarse sand to clay.  Some pedons do not have a C horizon within a depth of 60 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cubden, Gunclub, McIntosh, McKranz, and Saunders series (it is assumed the Cubden series is competing pending on update in the classification).  Cubden, McIntosh, and McKranz soils formed in a silt mantle over glacial till and have 2C horizons containing 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Gunclub soils have clay till within depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Saunders soils are poorly drained and have silty clay and clay textures within a depth of 40 inches."

Antler soils are on adjacent interbeach areas where lake sediments are moderately deep over till.  They are fine-loamy.  Beotia, Colvin, Overly and Perella soils are in a drainage sequence with Bearden soils.  Beotia and Overly soils are at higher elevations in the lake plain.  They do not have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches and have Bw horizons.  Colvin and Perella soils are in swales and lower lying flats and basins.  Colvin soils are poorly drained.  Perella soils do not have calcic horizons within a depth of 16 inches.  Glyndon soils are on adjacent areas.  They are coarse-silty.  Gardena soils are on nearby lake plains at higher elevations.  They do not have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches and are coarse-silty.  Hegne soils are on adjacent lake plains.  They are fine. Lamoure soils are on floodplains of streams. They have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick."
