  "OVERVIEW": "The Bachelor series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from shale, sandstone, and tuff.  Bachelor soils are on mountainsides, ridges, alluvial fans, and foot slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 34 percent in the particle-size control section.  Calcium carbonate is usually present in all parts, except the surface layer may be leached in some pedons.  Lime is visible as a few fine white spots and streaks in some pedons, with no visible lime in others.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, with clay content ranging from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
