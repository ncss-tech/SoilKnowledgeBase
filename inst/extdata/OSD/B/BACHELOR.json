  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 34 percent in the particle-size control section.  Calcium carbonate is usually present in all parts, except the surface layer may be leached in some pedons.  Lime is visible as a few fine white spots and streaks in some pedons, with no visible lime in others.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, with clay content ranging from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Bachelor soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from sedimentary rocks and tuff.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., and the mean annual summer temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F.  Elevation is 8,700 to 10,000 feet."
