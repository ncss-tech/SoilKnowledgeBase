  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Borpark soil is calcareous throughout, although the A horizon may be leached in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 15 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments are dominantly cobble and stone size.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is slightly alkaline.\nThe upper Bt has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.  The lower Bt horizon has values of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 4 to 15 percent.  Clay content is 28 to 35 percent.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 35 percent.  The percentage of calcium carbonate decreases in the C horizon.  Texture is extremely cobbly silt loam, loam, or clay loam."

Bendire, Blaincreek, and Crackerville soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Curecanti, Harol, Hilger, Holter, Ironco, Sawbuck, and Shirttail soils lack carbonates in the Bt horizon.  In addition, Shirttail soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Harpole soils have 20 to 27 percent clay in the Bt horizon and a lithologic discontinuity between 20 and 40 inches. Shawmut soils have thinner Bt horizons and have gravel that dominates the control section.  Widtsoe soils have strongly cemented calcic horizons below the argillic horizon.  Also, Ironco soils are greater than 50 inches thick to the base of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Borpark soils are on steep stony breaks.  Slopes are 40 to 75 percent.  The soil formed in colluvium and glacially worked materials derived mainly from basalt and shale.  Elevations are 5,800 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperatures range from 40 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 85 to 110 days."
