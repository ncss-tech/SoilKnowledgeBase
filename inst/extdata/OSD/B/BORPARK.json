  "OVERVIEW": "The Borpark series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stony breaks.  They formed in colluvium and glacially worked materials derived mainly from basalt and shale.  Slopes are 40 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments are dominantly cobble and stone size.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is slightly alkaline.\nThe upper Bt has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.  The lower Bt horizon has values of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 4 to 15 percent.  Clay content is 28 to 35 percent.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 35 percent.  The percentage of calcium carbonate decreases in the C horizon.  Texture is extremely cobbly silt loam, loam, or clay loam."

Bendire, Blaincreek, and Crackerville soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Curecanti, Harol, Hilger, Holter, Ironco, Sawbuck, and Shirttail soils lack carbonates in the Bt horizon.  In addition, Shirttail soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Harpole soils have 20 to 27 percent clay in the Bt horizon and a lithologic discontinuity between 20 and 40 inches. Shawmut soils have thinner Bt horizons and have gravel that dominates the control section.  Widtsoe soils have strongly cemented calcic horizons below the argillic horizon.  Also, Ironco soils are greater than 50 inches thick to the base of the argillic horizon."
