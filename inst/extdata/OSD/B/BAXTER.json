  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 120 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid, unless lime has been added.  Chert fragments ranges from about 5 to 45 percent in individual layers, but the weighted average of the control section ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Chert fragments range from 2 mm to 10 inches in size.  Some pedons have few to common black or dark brown manganese concretions, coatings, or stains.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. In forested areas, the A horizon is 1 to 5 inches thick and has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam. In severely eroded pedons, texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hues of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has colors and textures like the Bt1 horizon.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hue of 5YR through 10R, values of 3 to 5, and chroma or 4 to 8.  Some pedons have chroma of 3 in individual layers, and some common mottles in shades of brown, olive, or gray in the lower part.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay or clay. A few pedons have texture of the fine earth fraction of silty clay loam in the upper part.\nThe Bt4 horizon is commonly mottled in shades of red, brown, olive, and gray, but the range allows colors of the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay or clay.\nThe C or BC horizons, where present, have colors and texture similar to the Bt4 horizon."
