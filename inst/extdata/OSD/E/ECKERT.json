  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eckert series consists of soils that are shallow to indurated limestone bedrock. These well drained soils formed in residuum derived from limestone of Ordovician and Cambrian age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus.  Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent slopes. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 668 mm (26 in).",

Mid and short grasses along with forbs and a few small shrubs are present. The dominant grass is little bluestem.  Other grasses include green sprangletop, sideoats grama, Arizona cottontop, vine mesquite, pinhole bluestem, fall witchgrass, and hooded windmillgrass. Woody plants include live oak, tasajillo, Texas persimmon, yucca, and mesquite. Forbs, such as sagewort, and gaura are present.  With heavy stocking rates the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant community of  croton, pricklypear, tasajillo, Texas persimmon, mesquite, and other woody plants."
