  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland.  The climax plant community is grassland with an occasional live oak and low shrubs throughout the landscape. Mid and short grasses along with forbs and a few small shrubs are present. The dominant grass is little bluestem.  Other grasses include green sprangletop, sideoats grama, Arizona cottontop, vine mesquite, pinhole bluestem, fall witchgrass, and hooded windmillgrass. Woody plants include live oak, tasajillo, Texas persimmon, yucca, and mesquite. Forbs, such as sagewort, and gaura are present.  With heavy stocking rates the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant community of  croton, pricklypear, tasajillo, Texas persimmon, mesquite, and other woody plants."
