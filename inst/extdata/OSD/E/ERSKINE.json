  "OVERVIEW": "The Erskine series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from acid and basic igneous rock on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
