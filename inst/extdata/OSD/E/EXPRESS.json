  "OVERVIEW": "The Express series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in materials weathered from dioritic igneous rock. Express soils are on side slopes interfluves and drainages of hills and mountains on islands. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F).",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are Oboship, Bosun, Nauti, Flyer, Loadline and Marpol. Oboship soils are found on predominately north aspects under continuous stands of oak and chaparral. Bosun soils are skeletal and found on side slopes especially lower portions, Nauti soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon. Flyer soils have an argillic horizon. Loadline soils are shallow and typically found on convex positions like crests of interfluves and side slopes. Marpol soils are fine textured. All these soils are found on hills and mountains of islands."
