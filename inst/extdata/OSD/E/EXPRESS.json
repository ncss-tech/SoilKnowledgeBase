  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are Oboship, Bosun, Nauti, Flyer, Loadline and Marpol. Oboship soils are found on predominately north aspects under continuous stands of oak and chaparral. Bosun soils are skeletal and found on side slopes especially lower portions, Nauti soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon. Flyer soils have an argillic horizon. Loadline soils are shallow and typically found on convex positions like crests of interfluves and side slopes. Marpol soils are fine textured. All these soils are found on hills and mountains of islands."
