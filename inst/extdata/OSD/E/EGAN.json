  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to loam or clay loam till ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The silty solum has few or common granitic pebbles up to 2 inches in diameter.  The depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 19 inches thick and extends into the Bw horizon in most pedons.  The series control section is silty clay loam or silt loam averaging 25 to 35 percent clay and 3 to 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay loam but is silt loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and 2Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bk horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam and the 2Bk horizon is clay loam or loam.  They are slightly or moderately alkaline.  There are few to many accumulations of carbonate.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Distinct or prominent mottles are common or many in the 2C horizons."

These soils formed in silty materials that mantle loam and clay loam glacial till between depths of 25 and 40 inches.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent, and surfaces are convex to plane.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches."

Moody and Wentworth soils are on plane to concave slopes near the Egan soil.  Beadle, Shindler, and Ethan soils formed in glacial till and are on the steeper convex areas in close association with Egan soils.  Viborg, Trent, and Whitewood soils are in swales.  Chancellor soils have a fine textured argillic horizon and have an aquic moisture regime and are in swales.  Clarno soils are fine-loamy, formed in glacial till, and are on convex parts of the landscape.  Huntimer soils have a fine textured control section and are on flats above the Egan soils.  Tetonka and Worthing soils are in depressions and are wetter and have fine-textured argillic horizons.  Whitewood soils have an aquic moisture regime."
