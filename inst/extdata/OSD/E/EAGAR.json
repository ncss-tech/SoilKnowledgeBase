  "OVERVIEW": "The Eagar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from basalt basic tuff with some influence from old alluvium. These soils are on terraces of fans. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
