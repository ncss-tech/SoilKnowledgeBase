The soils are formed in mixed alluvium from basalt basic tuff with some influence from old alluvium. These soils are at elevations of 6,900 to 7,800 feet in a continental climate. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 44 degrees F. to about 48 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 128 days."

All of these have less than 50 percent coarse  fragments in the control section and lack the calcic horizon that is  characteristic of the Eagar soils. Apache soils are shallow over bedrock and the Nutrioso soils are stratified and members of a fine-loamy family. Clover Springs soils are in a fine-silty family, and  Luth soils are fine-textured."
