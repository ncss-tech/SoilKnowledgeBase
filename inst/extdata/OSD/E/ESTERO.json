    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil reaction of the Oa and A horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline by field test and from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline after drying.  The Bh\nhorizon is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from about 245 to 350 mmho/cm in the Oa horizon and from about 15 to 45 mmho/cm in the mineral\nhorizons.\nThe Oa horizon or Oe horizon has hue 10YR, value 2 or 3, chroma 1 or 2.\nThe A1 horizon has hue 10YR, value 2, chroma 1, or value 3 or 4, chroma 1 or 2; hue 2.5Y, value 3 or 4, chroma 2; or hue N, value 2 to 4.  Where value is 3 or less and chroma 2 or less thickness is less than 10 inches either before or after mixing with the Oa or Oe to a depth of 10 inches.  Texture is sand, fine sand, mucky sand, or mucky fine sand.\nThe A2 horizon has hue 10YR, value 5 to 7, chroma 1 or 2 with or without mottles and streaks of brown, yellow, red, or gray. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue 10YR, value 2, chroma 1, or value 3, chroma 1 or 2; hue 7.5YR, value 3, chroma 2; or hue 5YR, value 2, chroma 1 or 2, or value 3, chroma 1 to 4.  Colors with higher chroma as described do not occur in the B21h horizon of all pedons.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  Few to common uncoated sand grains are in the upper part of the horizon\nThe B3 horizon has hue 10YR, value 3, chroma 3, or value 4, chroma 2 to 4; hue 7.5YR and 5YR value 4, chroma 2 or 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue 10YR, value 4 to 7, chroma 3 or less. Texture is sand or fine sand.  Some pedons have shell mixed with the sand."

All the associated soils lack histic epipedons and are on higher upland landscapes.  Basinger, Boca, Canaveral, and Pompano soils lack spodic horizons.  In addition, Boca soils have argillic horizons underlain by\nlimestone; Canaveral soils are better drained and are mixed sand and shell; Pompano soils lack subsurface diagnostic horizons; and Basinger soils have non-spodic Bh horizons.  EauGallie soils have\nan argillic horizon beneath the spodic horizon.  Immokalee soils have a spodic horizon at deeper depths and Waveland soils are on an orstein family."
