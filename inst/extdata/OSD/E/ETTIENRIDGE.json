  "OVERVIEW": "The Ettienridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from limestone.  These soils occur on mountain slopes, hillslopes, canyons, and structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
