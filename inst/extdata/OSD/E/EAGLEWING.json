  "OVERVIEW": "The Eaglewing series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy calcareous till or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, moraines and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
