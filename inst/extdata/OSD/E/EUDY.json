  "OVERVIEW": "The Eudy series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess and the underlying clayey residuum from cherty dolostone. These soils are on gently sloping ridgetops and toeslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
