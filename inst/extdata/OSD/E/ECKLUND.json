  "OVERVIEW": "The Ecklund series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils formed in residuum and eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Ecklund soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
