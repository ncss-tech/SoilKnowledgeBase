  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The histic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches thick.\nThe Oe horizon contains many partially decomposed stems and leaves.  It has chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have a thin Oi horizon at the surface.  The Oa horizon has chroma of 1 or 2.  They are neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 3. It is silt loam, mucky silt loam, silty clay loam, or mucky silty clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It, typically, is silt loam or silty clay loam, but strata of silty clay occur in some pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Iron stains and 10 to 15 percent snail shells are common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Eramosh soils are in deep depressions on glacial moraines and collapsed glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 1 percent.  The Eramosh soils formed in silty water-sorted sediments overlain by organic materials.  These organic materials consist of moderately decomposed slough sedge, bullrushes, cattails, and leaves from surrounding aspen trees.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 39 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 26 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bottineau, Kelvin, Metigoshe and Rolla soils.  These soils do not have a histic epipedon.  In addition, Bottineau and Kelvin soils contain more sand and formed in glacial till on adjacent slopes.  Metigoshe soils have gravelly C horizons and formed in glacial outwash.  Rolla soils contain more clay and formed in clayey lacustrine sediments on nearby uplands.  The Bottineau, Kelvin and Metigoshe soils are well drained.  The Rolla soils are moderately well drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Runoff is ponded.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic portion and moderate in the underlying mineral portion.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 2.0 feet above the surface to 1.0 foot below the surface at some time during the period of November through July.  It is at a depth of up to 5.0 feet above the surface in the ponded phase."
