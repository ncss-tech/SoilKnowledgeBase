  "OVERVIEW": "The Egeria series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Egeria soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
