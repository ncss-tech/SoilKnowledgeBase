It is usually dry, in some part, for more than 120 cumulative days during the same period.  It is continuously moist in some part November through April, but not moist in all parts for 45 consecutive days from January through April.  The period of maximum precipitation is July through October.  The soil is driest during April and May.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Eicks series occurs on very broad, gently sloping lake plain of Pleistocene age.  The surface soil appears to be reworked alluvium and Bt appears to be developing in lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation of about 14 to 16 inches and a mean annual air temperature 57 to 60 degrees F.  (The series is apparently borderline between the thermic and mesic temperature families).  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 5,500 feet.  Frost-free period is 160 to 180 days."

The Anamite soils lack argillic horizons; the Forrest series contain between 15 and 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and lack mollic epipedons; the Cloverdale series are non-skeletal."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 15 inches (A,\n2A and 3A horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 62 inches (Bt horizons).\nThe series needs study to determine if mottles are significant to present genesis, or if relict from lacustrine sediments.  The clay in the Bt may not be pedogenic but may be lacustrine in origin.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A site near the type location was sampled (S92-023-001) for characterization.  This site had redder colors (5YR) and was clayey-skeletal.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
