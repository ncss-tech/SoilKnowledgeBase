  "OVERVIEW": "The Ezell series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous sandy alluvium of Recent age. These soils are on nearly level broad flood plains of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.",

Saline salts are present and electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 8 dS/m throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, moist value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand. It has few to common, red to yellowish brown iron concentrations and grayish brown or gray iron depletions. Some pedons have accumulations of salt or gypsum crystals.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, moist value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or sand and may be stratified with finer textured material. It has few to common, redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red and brown, and grayish brown or gray redoximorphic depletions. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Homeland series. Similar soils are Dillwyn, Gaddy, Gracemont, Gracemore, and Lincoln soils. Homeland soils have 5Y and 5GY colors throughout. Gaddy and Lincoln soils are somewhat excessively drained and do not have a water table within 60 inches of the surface most of the year. Dillwyn soils lack an irregular distribution of organic matter within 50 inches of the surface. Gracemont soils have a coarse-loamy textural control section and lack a water table within 12 inches of the surface during most of the year. Gracemore soils lack a water table within 12 inches of the surface during most of the year and also lack redoximorphic features within 10 inches of the surface."

Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 32 to 52. Frost free days range from 185 to 230. Elevation ranges from 800 to 2200 feet."

A water table fluctuates from 12 inches above the soil surface to 12 inches below the surface during most of the year. These soils are frequently or occasionally flooded for very brief periods during March through August. Ponding is common for long to very long duration. These soils are affected with episaturation and endosaturation."
