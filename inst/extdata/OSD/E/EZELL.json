  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are slightly or moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout. Saline salts are present and electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 8 dS/m throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, moist value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand. It has few to common, red to yellowish brown iron concentrations and grayish brown or gray iron depletions. Some pedons have accumulations of salt or gypsum crystals.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, moist value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or sand and may be stratified with finer textured material. It has few to common, redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red and brown, and grayish brown or gray redoximorphic depletions. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Homeland series. Similar soils are Dillwyn, Gaddy, Gracemont, Gracemore, and Lincoln soils. Homeland soils have 5Y and 5GY colors throughout. Gaddy and Lincoln soils are somewhat excessively drained and do not have a water table within 60 inches of the surface most of the year. Dillwyn soils lack an irregular distribution of organic matter within 50 inches of the surface. Gracemont soils have a coarse-loamy textural control section and lack a water table within 12 inches of the surface during most of the year. Gracemore soils lack a water table within 12 inches of the surface during most of the year and also lack redoximorphic features within 10 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ezell soils are on nearly level broad flood plains of the Central Rolling Red Plains and Central Rolling Red Prairies. They formed in calcareous sandy alluvium of Recent age. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 32 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F. Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 32 to 52. Frost free days range from 185 to 230. Elevation ranges from 800 to 2200 feet."

Gaddy, Jester, and Lincoln soils are found on higher areas and lack a water table within 60 inches from the surface. Gracemont and Gracemore are found on similar areas but are somewhat poorly drained, lack a water table within 12 inches and do not pond water for long periods of time."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Ezell soils are very poorly drained. Runoff is negligible. Permeability is rapid. A water table fluctuates from 12 inches above the soil surface to 12 inches below the surface during most of the year. These soils are frequently or occasionally flooded for very brief periods during March through August. Ponding is common for long to very long duration. These soils are affected with episaturation and endosaturation."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used as rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly sedges and rushes with lesser amounts of Switchgrass and other tall grasses. Common trees are Buttonbush, Tamarisk, and Willow."
