  "OVERVIEW": "The Eguaje series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt. Eguaje soils are on rolling basalt mesas and lava plateaus. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
