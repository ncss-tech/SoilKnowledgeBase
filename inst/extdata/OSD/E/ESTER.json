  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loess mantle over weathered bedrock ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The organic mat ranges in thickness from 8 to 16 inches.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 2 to 14 inches below the mineral surface. Texture of the control section is silt loam or silt with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay.  There is a substantial mica content, but less than 40 percent.  Weighted average coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 35 percent and is dominantly gravel size schist fragments.   Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  This horizon may be very thin or absent in some profiles.\nThe 2Cf horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 2, 3 or 4; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  There is greater than 40 percent weathered angular schist fragments.\nThe 2Crf horizon is perennially frozen weathered schist overlying consolidated schist at depth."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ester soils formed in a thick organic mat overlying a micaceous loess mantle underlain by weathered schist bedrock.  They occur on steep, dominantly north facing mountain sideslopes.  Slopes range from 7 to 100 percent.  The climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 24 to 28 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Runoff is moderate to rapid.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic mat and moderate in the mineral soil above the permafrost.  The profile is saturated and free water is present above the permafrost.  Loss of the organic mat may results in lowering of the permafrost level with subsequent release of meltwater."
