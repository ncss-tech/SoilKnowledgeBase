  "OVERVIEW": "The Exfo series consist of very shallow, somewhat excessively well drained soils that formed in material weathered from massive, exfoliated Miocene Picture Gorge Basalt.  They are on sideslopes and associated with horizontal layers of exposed basalt.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 1 to 8 inches but is typically 4 to 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry and value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry.  It is loamy coarse sand with 5 to 10 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent coarse gravel derived from fractured, Picture Gorge Basalt and 15 to 35 percent fine gravel formed in place from exfoliated, basalt.  Organic matter is 0.5 to 1.0 percent."

These soils formed in material weathered from massive, exfoliated Miocene Picture Gorge Basalt.  Elevation is 1,400 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."

Brisbois soils are on steep slopes near Badlands, clayey family, and are formed over weathered tuff.  Drinkwater, Gooserock, Haystack and Ninetysix soils are all loamy-skeletal and are very deep to bedrock.  Drinkwater and Lickskillet soils are on south slopes.  Gooserock soils are on north slopes.  Haystack soils are on alluvial fans.  Lickskillet soils have a mollic epipedon and are 12 to 20 inches to bedrock."
