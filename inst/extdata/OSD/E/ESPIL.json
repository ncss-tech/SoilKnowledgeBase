  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the duripan ranges from 8 to 14 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 6 to 10 inches and may include part or all of the argillic horizon.  The soils are usually dry during most years.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 63 degrees F.  The soils are usually noncalcareous, but may be calcareous in the duripans.  pH values range from 6.1 to 6.8 in the noncalcareous part of the profile, and as high as 8.8 where lime occurs in the duripan.  Color of the A1 horizons includes hues of 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry and 2.5 to 3.5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3.  When the surface 7 inches is mixed, the color values are less than 5.5 and 3.5 moist.  The upper part of the A1 horizon is normally massive, but may range to weak thin or medium platy structure.  The lower part of the A1 horizon ranges from weak to strong, very fine to medium, subangular blocky or granular structure.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.  An A2 or A&B horizon may be present ranging up to 4 inches thick and containing many bleached sand grains.  Color of the B2t horizon includes hues of 7.5YR but may be 5YR or 10YR, values of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 3 or 4.  Texture is predominantly clay or light clay, but may occasionally include heavy clay loam.  Structure ranges from moderate or strong, fine or medium subangular, angular blocky, or prismatic.  Occasionally the B2t horizon will include very thin (less than 3/4 inch thick) discontinuous lenses of heavy clay.  The color of the duripan includes hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, or N, values of 6 to 8 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 0 to 6.  The upper 2 to over 18+ inches are indurated and the lower part is strongly cemented. Continuous opal laminae are present in the upper part of the duripan."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Powley and Stampede soils have been classified in the same family.  Powley soils differ by having 16 to 20 Inch thick sola and depth to duripans, and 6 to 11 inch thick B2t horizons.  Stampede soils differ by having 18 to 32 inch thick sola and depth to duripans, and very hard and very firm B2t horizons.  Beber, Donna, Reeser, Salisbury, and Satt soils are similar.  Beber, Reeser, and Salisbury soils differ by having mean annual soil temperature greater than 47 degrees F.  In addition, Reeser soils differ by having developed in a loess mantle, having 17 inch thick mollic epipedons, and 36+ inch depth to the duripan.  Salisbury soils differ by having 10 to 19 inch thick B2t horizons.  Donna soils differ by having abrupt AB boundaries, fine clay B2t horizons, and 16 to 26 inch thick sola and depth to duripan.  Satt soils differ by having 20 to 30 inch thick sola and a weighted average of 50 to 70 percent coarse fragments in their argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Espil soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping terraces and truncated alluvial fans with slope gradients of 0 to 15 percent.  They have developed in loamy valley-fill materials derived mainly from siliceous tuffs, with admixtures from basalt, andesite, and rhyolite.  These soils are at elevations from 5,500 to 6,500 feet in a cold, continental climate having a mean annual precipitation of 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Espil soils occur in the same general area as Hart Camp, Fertaline, and Home Camp soils.  In addition to the aforementioned Powley soils.  Home Camp soils are very deep and lack duripans.  Fertaline soils have clay natric horizons and lack mollic epipedons.  Hart Camp soils have clay loam B2t horizons and are shallow over tuff bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil is being removed from the Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area soil survey. The areas mapped as Espil in the area are in a mesic soil temperature regime. Espil in Washoe County, Nevada, Central Part (NV771) will likely be correlated to a mesic soil in the near future. It is anticipated that the Espil series will be mapped in the Sheldon Antelope Refuge, Nevada (NV792) area. Espil soils were formerly classified as Chestnut soils.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 5/68.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
