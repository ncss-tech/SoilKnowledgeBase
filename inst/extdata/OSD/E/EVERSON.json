Annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has a least one Everson Series inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
