  "OVERVIEW": "The Everson series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits, loess, and glacial outwash.  Everson soils are in depressions on outwash terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The  average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
