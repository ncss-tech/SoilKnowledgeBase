It is usually moist, in some part, less than 50 cumulative days during the same period. It is intermittently moist in some part November through March. The period of maximum precipitation is July through October. The soil is driest during April, May and June. Typic aridic to ustic aridic moisture regime based on precipitation.\nCapillary water rises from a fluctuating water table throughout the year and rainfall and flood waters moisten the profile in the late summer.\nSoil Temperature: 48 to 57 degrees F.\nSilicate clay content: control section weighted average - 2 to 10 percent.\nRock fragment content: control section weighted average - 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nReaction: slightly to moderately alkaline.\nDepth to seasonal water table: 40 to 60 inches.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent; none to slightly effervescent depending on texture, due to very finely disseminated carbonates.\nRedoximorphic features: none to many, fine to medium, and faint to distinct, dark yellowish brown, redox concentrations. Redox depletions are present below 40 inches and generally in finer textured layers.\nSalinity: EC of 0 to 4 mmhos/cm\nSodicity: SAR of 0 to 5\nC horizons\nHue - 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist\nChroma: 2 through 4\nTexture: stratified coarse sand to silty clay; most horizons are dominantly fine sand, loamy fine sand, and sand, with laminations and thin strata of very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, silt loam and silty clay; individual horizons are laterally discontinuous and cross laminated"

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bebeevar (NM), Bowington (UT), Carwalker (NV), Labyrinth (UT), and Sagouspe (NV) series. The Bebeevar soils are calcareous throughout, have rock fragments that range up to 35 percent in the particle size control section and are derived from granite, quartzite, and sandstone. Bowington soils have a lithologic discontinuity at moderate depths. The Carwalker and Sagouspe soils have an aridic (torric) moisture regime that borders on xeric.  The Labyrinth soils have hues redder than 10YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Escawetter soils are on nearly level flood plains of intermittent rivers and streams. These soils formed in stratified recent alluvium and stream alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Elevation ranges from 5100 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 13 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October. These soils receive up to 5 inches of additional moisture from summer flooding and capillary rise above a fluctuating water table. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 55 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nEntisol and Fluventic features: The lack of diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons due to continual deposition of fresh sediments and alluvial stratification, with strata of loamy fine sand and finer in subhorizons between 10 and 40 inches (C3 and C4 horizons). An irregular decrease in the percentage of organic carbon with depth.\nOxyaquic subgroup: Saturation due to the presence of a seasonal high water table within 60 inches of the surface for more than 1 month in most years.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
