    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 48 inches. Depth to the densic materials commonly is more than 19 inches but the range includes 15 to 35 inches.  The volume of rock fragments larger than 3 inches ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 10 percent in the B and C horizons.  Rock fragments smaller than 3 inches range from 5 to 35 percent in the A and B horizon and 10 to 35 percent in the C horizon. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the B horizon and in the Cd horizon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid except where limed.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 4. Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture of the A horizon ranges from loamy sand to fine sandy loam and includes gravelly analogs.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon. The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 7. Texture of the Bw1 horizon is sandy loam and includes gravelly analogs. Maximum depth of sandy loam texture is 18 inches from the soil surface.\nThe Bw2 and Bw3 horizons have hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Texture of the Bw2 and Bw3 horizons is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or their gravelly analogs.  The B horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive.  It is friable or very friable.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogs.  It has weak thin, medium or thick platy structure or it is massive.  It is firm or very firm.  Some pedons have friable C layers with loamy sand or sand textures and similar colors."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Essex soils occur on glacial till upland plains, hills and ridges.  Slope gradients are mainly 3 to 25 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent.  The regolith consists of sandy glacial till derived principally from granite and gneiss.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. and the mean precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  Average frost free period ranges from 120 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Canton, Gloucester, Merrimac, Montauk and Scituate soils on nearby landscapes.  The poorly drained Norwell and very poorly drained Brockton soils are associated with Essex in drainage sequence. Canton and Gloucester soils lack a firm substratum.   Merrimac soils formed in glacial outwash and are somewhat excessively drained. Montauk and Scituate soils have an 18 to 30 inch loamy mantle over a loamy sand firm substratum, and Scituate soils, in addition, have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the cambic horizon. Also associated are Charlton and Hollis soils on nearby landscapes.  Charlton soils have fine sandy loam texture and lack a firm substratum.  Hollis soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Other less extensively associated soils are the Carver, Hinckley and Windsor which developed in thick deposits of sands and gravel on outwash plains."

The Montauk series, which includes soils with, fine sandy loam A and B horizons overlying a firm loamy sand substratum were included in the Essex series in New England prior to about 1965.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Oe and Ap horizon);\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 31 inches (Bw1,Bw2, and Bw3 horizons);\n3. Densic contact - firm, root-restrictive layer at 31 inches (Cd horizon);\n4. Oxyaquic subgroup - presence of water table at 18 to 24 inches November through March.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
