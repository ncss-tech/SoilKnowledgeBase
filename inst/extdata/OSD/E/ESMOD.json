  "OVERVIEW": "The Esmod series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with eolian surficial additions of volcanic ash.  Esmod soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
