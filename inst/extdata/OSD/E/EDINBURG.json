Butler and Carbika soils have free carbonates at 46 to 203 cm (18 to 80 inches). Chancellor, and Worthing soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 61 cm (24 inches).  Clarinda, Haig, and Minnetonka soils average more than 40 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Coatsburg soils average more than 10 percent sand in the control section. Fosterburg soils have concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. Lodgepole soils are dry in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 30 days of the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Mazaska soils average more than 10 percent sand in the lower one-quarter of the control section. Sacville soils have rock fragments in the subsoil and substratum and formed entirely in alluvium. Sampsel soils have free carbonates at depths of less than 127 cm (50 inches).   Sampsel soils also have coarse fragments of shale in the lower one-third of the control section.  Taintor soils average more than 32 percent clay in the first one-quarter of the control section.  Virden soils do not have an E horizon or noticeable clean silt grains in the control section.  Winterset, and Worthing soils average less than 12.2  degrees C (54 degrees F) mean soil temperature in the soil temperature control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Edinburg soils are in shallow depressions or on flat summits on loess covered Illinoian till plains.  Slope gradients commonly are less than 1 percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in loess.  Upon drying, the Edinburg soils normally appear grayer on the landscape than other surrounding Mollisols.  The mean annual temperature varies from 10.0 to 13.9 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation varies from about 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches)."

Denny soils are in similar shallow depressions on nearby upland plains and are only adjacent to Edinburg soils in a few places.  The somewhat poorly drained Ipava soils are on slightly higher positions.  Virden and Sable soils are nearly level but adjacent to and slightly higher than Edinburg soils."

The Clarinda, Coatsburg, and Sampsel soils are competed here even though they are still listed as being in the \"sloping\" family.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 41 cm (16 inches) (Ap, A, and BE horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 41 to 104 cm (16 to 41 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons); aquoll feature - distinct mottles in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
