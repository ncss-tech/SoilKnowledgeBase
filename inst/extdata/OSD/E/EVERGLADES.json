  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic material is more than 51 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout.  The pH is more than 4.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride in all horizons.\nThe Oa or Oap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 2.  Fiber content ranges from about 10 to 40 percent before rubbing and less than 17 percent after rubbing.  Texture is muck.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Fiber content ranges from about 35 to 80 percent before rubbing and about 17 to 40 percent after rubbing.  Color of the Sodium pyrophosphate extract is in shades of gray and brown.  Texture is mucky peat.\nSome pedons have Oi horizons.  Where present, colors are similar to the Oe horizon but also include value of 4.  Fiber content after rubbing is more than 40 percent.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract color is in shades of gray.  Oi horizons are less than 10 inches thick if they occur within the 12 to 51 inch control section.  They may be thicker below 51 inches.  The bottom tier ranges from fibric to sapric material."
