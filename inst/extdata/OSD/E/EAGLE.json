  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eagle soils are on stream terraces at elevations of 748 to 869 meters. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in alluvium (Holocene) mainly from granitic rocks. The average annual precipitation is 254 to 330 mm. The average annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C. The frost-free period is 145 to 155 days."

Eagle soils are subject to rare flooding where not protected. Under flood irrigation these soils are regularly saturated to depths of less than 50 cm during the growing season."
