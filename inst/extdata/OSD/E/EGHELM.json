  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)\nRemarks:  The soil moisture regime is borderline to xeric because of the snow melt beginning nearly 45 days before the end of the 120 days after the winter solstice.  This snow melt moistens all parts of the moisture control section.  The moisture control section is also dry in all parts for more than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  It, however, is not moist in some part for half the time the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. or for 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is above 8 degrees C.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Seventh Edition, 1996\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
