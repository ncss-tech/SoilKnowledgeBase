  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the fill materials is greater than 100 cm. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 60 percent, with a weighted average of less than 35 percent in the control section. The weighted average of human artifacts exceeds 10 percent in the control section. Textures are commonly sandy loam, loam or silt loam but may include loamy sand or sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Free carbonates derived from artifactual materials are found within 100 cm.\nThe ^A or ^Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Structure is granular or subangular blocky with very friable or friable consistence, although compacted areas may have platy structure and/or firm consistence.\nThe ^Bw horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Structure is commonly subangular blocky with friable consistence, although compacted areas may have platy structure and/or firm consistence.\nThe ^C horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, value 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8. Structure is commonly massive with friable to firm consistence. Some pedons may have plate-like divisions.\nNatural horizons may occur under the human transported material. Their properties are similar to comparable natural soils of the region."
