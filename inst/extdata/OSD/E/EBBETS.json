  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ebbets series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thick mantle (greater than 100 centimeters) of loamy human transported material with more than 10 percent human artifacts. They occur in anthropogenically altered landscapes in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in areas where the soil cap has not been compacted, but is only moderately high where it has been compacted. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1190 mm.",

Coarse fragments range from 0 to 60 percent, with a weighted average of less than 35 percent in the control section. The weighted average of human artifacts exceeds 10 percent in the control section. Textures are commonly sandy loam, loam or silt loam but may include loamy sand or sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Free carbonates derived from artifactual materials are found within 100 cm.\nThe ^A or ^Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Structure is granular or subangular blocky with very friable or friable consistence, although compacted areas may have platy structure and/or firm consistence.\nThe ^Bw horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Structure is commonly subangular blocky with friable consistence, although compacted areas may have platy structure and/or firm consistence.\nThe ^C horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, value 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8. Structure is commonly massive with friable to firm consistence. Some pedons may have plate-like divisions.\nNatural horizons may occur under the human transported material. Their properties are similar to comparable natural soils of the region."
