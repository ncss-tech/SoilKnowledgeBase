  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: El Dara soils are exposed on side slopes of a highly dissected upland ridge.  They are included with the Dissected Till Plains geographic section.  Slope gradients range from 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy materials of Cretaceous age.  Some pedons formed in as much as 20 inches of loess.  Some of the area is believed to be unglaciated.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 5l to 55 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches, frost free period ranges from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 650 to 850 feet above sea level."

Clarksdale, Ipava, Keomah, and Timewell soils are somewhat poorly drained, formed in loess, average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and are found above El Dara soils on less sloping areas.  Downsouth, Winfield and Wakenda soils formed in loess, average less than 15 percent sand in the particle-size control section, and are found above El Dara soils on less sloping areas.  In addition, Wakenda soils are well drained.  Gosport soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, formed in shale residuum, have a paralithic contact at depths below 20 inches, are well drained, and are on slopes below the El Dara soils.  Keswick soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, are on similar slopes below El Dara soils, and formed in Pre-Illinoian age glacial till.  Lindley soils are on similar or steeper slopes, typically at lower elevations, are well drained, and formed in Pre-Illinoian age glacial till.  Passport soils formed in loamy pedisediments and in Illinoian glacial till that contains a strongly developed paleosol, and are somewhat poorly drained.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification adjusted to agree with lST Issue #17 on 23 Aug 94 by CLG. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 6 to 61 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, Bt6, and Bt7 horizons).  Oxyaquic subgroup based on soil saturation above a depth of 40 inches.  Well drained El Dara soils will be included in the Oxyaquic subgroup.\nSeries relocated and adjusted for Adams County Update 5/14/97 by RDC-RT Changes made to location, description, geology, competing series, geographically associated soils, drainage, and permeability.\nIt is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the   modern solum from those of the older materials.  Development can go down several feet.\nNote:  El Dara soils may range to somewhat poorly or poorly drained if a paleosol is present near the surface.  As slope and erosion increase, coarse-loamy and sandy textures become dominant and may warrant new series because of the uniqueness of the Cretaceous aged Baylis formation in western Illinois.  The Baylis formation resembles the Dakota formation in western Iowa and is composed of layered sand, pink and gray clays, and gravel members.  A small area near Wedron, Illinois may also have this type of formation.\nEl Dara was formerly identified as being formed in outwash materials. Areas mapped El Dara outside Cretaceous boundaries should be investigated during MLRA update activities.  Many of the geographically associated soils in the Cretaceous areas are formed in deposits not recognized in their respective Official Series Descriptions.  Clayey and very sandy soils are considered unnamed inclusions in mapping units of the El Dara series.  There is not sufficient acreage for separate series in this geologic sequence to represent new series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for a different El Dara pedon is identified by laboratory numbers 22641-22649. It is on file at the NRCS MLRA Office Region 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
