  "OVERVIEW": "The Elpedro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in Colluvium, alluvium and eolian materials derived from limestone and siltstone on fan piedmonts, mesas, benches, valley sides, low hills, alluvial flats and rolling plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
