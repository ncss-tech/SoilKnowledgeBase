Elevation ranges from 5,450 to 7,800 feet.  The soils formed in eolian materials, alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone and siltstone.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 100 to 130 days."
