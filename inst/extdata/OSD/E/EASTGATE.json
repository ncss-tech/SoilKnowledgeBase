These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from andesite and other igneous and sedimentary rocks with a component of aeolian material from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,213 to 1,890 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 to 150 mm, mean annual temperature is about 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 110 to 140 days."
