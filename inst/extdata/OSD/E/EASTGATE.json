  "OVERVIEW": "The Eastgate series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and aeolian deposits on alluvial fans, fan skirts and fan piedmonts often with sand sheets.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
