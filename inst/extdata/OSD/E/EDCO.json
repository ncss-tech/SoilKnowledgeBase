  "OVERVIEW": "The Edco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation.  These soils are on flats on coastal prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1116 mm (44 in).",

    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Edna series.  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime. The classification was changed from Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs to Oxyaquic Vertic Hapludalfs in 2016 during the update of MLRA 150A.  The Aquertic Chromic classification was based on preliminary analysis of a soil moisture study on a similar soil on a similar landform. Upon further analysis, the previously noted aquic conditions occurred during abnormally wet years. During normal years, these soils will become saturated in the zone above the argillic horizon but not long enough for reduction to take place. The series classification supports mixed mineralogy and is based on reference samples analyzed for mineralogy by Texas A&M University.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in) (Ap and A horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 18 to 173 cm (7 to 68 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk and BCtk horizons)\nVertic feature: Cracks and/or wedge-shaped aggregates within the upper part of the argillic horizon.\nSecondary carbonates: 112 to 203 cm (44 to 80 in) (Btk, BCtk, BCk1, and BCk2 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  S97TX-089-13-2, Texas A&M University.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
