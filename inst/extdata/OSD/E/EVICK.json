    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to volcanic tuff is 10 to 14 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 10 percent field estimated clay.  It has phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.2 to 0.8 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 15 percent (air dried).  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It contains 25 to 35 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Evick soils are on steep to very steep south-facing side slopes on canyons.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic tuff with an influence of volcanic ash.   Slopes are 30 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 2200 to 3200 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Happus soils are on south-facing toe slopes, ashy-pumiceous, and moderately deep to pumice.  Spilyay soils are on south-facing foot slopes, fine, montmorillonitic, and very deep to volcanic tuff."
