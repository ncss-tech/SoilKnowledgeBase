  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Texture of the profile other than surface soil ranges from silty clay loam to loamy fine sand.  The heavier textures have in most places been associated with heavier textured surface soils, medium textured soils with medium textured surface soils, and the moderately light textured subsoils with moderately light textured surface soils.  Lime veining is very faint in places.  The soils may be very uniform in texture throughout, or it may consist of several strata."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  This series is associated with Genola and Calita series.   These soils have less gray and more\npinkish color than the Genola soils and lack the lime developed horizon and the mottling that characterizes Calita soils.  They have characteristics somewhat similar to those of the Ackmen series, but they are not nearly so dark colored or so high in organic matter and humus.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING;  Smooth surface, slightly undulating in places.  Slopes range from 1 to about 6 percent."
