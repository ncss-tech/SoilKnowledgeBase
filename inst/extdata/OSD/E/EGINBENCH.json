  "OVERVIEW": "The Eginbench series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on river terraces.  These soils formed in alluvial and eolian sand.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Permeability is rapid.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

An increase in the use of sprinkler irrigation is resulting in the lowering of the water table down slope from the sprinklers."
