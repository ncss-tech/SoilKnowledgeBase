Elevations are 4500 to 5200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with 3 to 4 feet of snow in winter. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F."

Grassy Butte soils are calcareous throughout and are on basalt plains.  St. Anthony soils are on lower terraces and have more than 35 percent gravel in the control section.  Wolverine soils are on established dunes at higher elevations."

An increase in the use of sprinkler irrigation is resulting in the lowering of the water table down slope from the sprinklers.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
