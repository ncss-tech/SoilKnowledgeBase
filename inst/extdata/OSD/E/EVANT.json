  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the petrocalcic horizon ranges from 14 to 20 inches thick.  Pebbles and cobbles of chert and limestone range from none to 35 percent by volume.\nThe A horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is mainly silty clay but silty clay loam, clay loam and their gravelly counterparts are included.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt and Bk horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 to 6.  They are clay or gravelly clay with average clay content of 60 to 80 percent.  The Bt reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.  The Bk horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkm horizon has colors in shades of white or pink with thin horizontal seams of yellow or brown.  It is plugged with carbonates and is weakly to strongly cemented.  This horizon has an indurated laminar cap 1/4 to 1 inch thick.  The cap is thinnest in landscape positions with the most slope and is absent in some pedons.  Roots enter this horizon only along fractures and in some of the softer horizontal seams.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly or strongly cemented chalky limestone.  It is massive or platy.  Some pedons are strongly cemented and platy in the upper part and weakly cemented and massive below.  It can be chipped or dug with a spade when moist."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Soils in similar families include Gruene, Mitre, Roughcreek, Slaughter, Speck, and Tarpley series.  Gruene, Mitre, Slaughter, and Speck soils have mixed mineralogy.  Mitre and Roughcreek soils are skeletal.  Roughcreek, Speck, and Tarpley soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon and are underlain by indurated limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Evant soils have plane to convex surfaces with slopes of 1 to 3 percent.  They mainly occur on gently sloping upland plateaus and low ridges.  These soils formed in clays and materials weathered from limestone of the Kiamichi Clay and Edwards Limestone undivided of the Fredericksburg Group of the Lower Cretaceous Period.  Mean annual precipitation is 28 to 34 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F. Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 56."
