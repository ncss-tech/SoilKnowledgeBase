  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Enet series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy sediments and the underlying stratified sand and gravel on the glacial outwash plains and flood plains.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying sand and gravel.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sand and gravel is about 24 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to carbonates commonly correspond to the depth of sand and gravel.  The upper control section has 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam, but some pedons are silt loam or fine sandy loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  This horizon typically is loam, but some pedons are clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The lower part up to 5 inches thick is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in most pedons.\nSome pedons have a BC or Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand and contains 15 to 45 percent gravel by volume.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The undersides of pebbles in the upper part of this horizon are coated with carbonate in most pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are nearly level to gently rolling on glacial outwash plains and flood plains.  The soils on flood plains are subject to rare flooding.  Typically, slope gradients are less than 4 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  They formed in loamy alluvium and the underlying stratified sand and gravel from glacial outwash sediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."

Alwilda, Blendon, Delmont, Hand, and Henkin soils are on similar landscapes.  Alwilda soils have a sandy control section. Blendon and Henkin soils have a coarse-loamy control section and do not have sand and gravel between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Delmont soils have sand and gravel at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Hand soils do not have sand and gravel between depths of 20 and 40 inches and formed in glacial drift."
