Emmons soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine sand and coarser in the particle-size control section. The A horizon contains up to 45 percent coarse fragments and the particle-size control section has 0 to 15 percent pebbles and cobbles. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent in the calcic horizon.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  It is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days following the  summer solstice to October 20, nor for as long as 90 cumulative days during this period. Hue is 2.5Y through 10YR.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5, and 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has value of 5 or 6, and 4 or 5 moist with chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 4 through 8, and 2 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bk2 horizon has value of 6 through 8, and 4 through 6 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,200 feet. Emmons soils are in a climatic setting that receives the annual precipitation in an evenly distributed pattern throughout the year with over 50 percent coming as snow.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
