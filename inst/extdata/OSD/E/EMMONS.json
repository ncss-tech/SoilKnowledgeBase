  "OVERVIEW": "The Emmons series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and glacial drift derived from mixed sources.  Emmons soils are on the sides of mesas and pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
