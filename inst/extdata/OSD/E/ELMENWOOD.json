    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Benchley, Elmendorf, Hallettsville, Lofton,  Renfro, Sproul, and Topia series.  Benchley, Hallettsville, and Lofton  soils are in the thermic temperature regime.  In addition, Hallettsville  soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons.  Elmendorf soils are dry for longer periods of time in the moisture  control section.  In addition, Elmendorf soils do not have redoximorphic  features in the Bt horizons.  Renfrow soils have mixed mineralogy.  Sproul and Topia soils have very-fine particle size control sections."
