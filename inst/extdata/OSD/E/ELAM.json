The lower horizons are generally light gray but may be very pale brown or white.  The surface texture varies from gravelly sandy or fine sandy loam to gravelly loamy sand.  The C horizon is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam.  The soil reaction is about medium acid throughout although the pH tends to increase slightly with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nearly level to gently sloping.  Soil is associated with short alluvial fans.  The Elam soils occur at elevations of 4,000 to 5,000 feet in a humid mesothermal but nearly microthermal climate, having a mean annual precipitation of 50 to 55 inches, with cool, nearly dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Snow covers much of the area from November until March.  The average January temperature is 30 degrees F., the average July temperature is 62 degrees F., with a mean annual temperature of 45 degrees F., and an average frost-free season of 80 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Elam soils occur in the same general areas the Childs, Chummy, Jiggs, and Lyonsville soils.  They resemble the Delaney, Jiggs, and Lyonsville soils in some respects.  However, the Delaney soils developed in alluvium from andesite which is usually tuffaceous.  The Jiggs soils developed in rhyolite and are shallow or moderately deep.  The Lyonsville soils developed in dacite and have weakly developed textural B horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; runoff is slow because of the rapid permeability.  High water tables may occur seasonally along the edges of wet meadows if the soil is underlain by slowly or less permeable rock strata."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used almost exclusively for timber production.  Cleared areas support little or no grass.  Some areas are mined for gravel.  Ponderosa pine, white fir, sugar pine, Jeffery pine, with an understory of squaw carpet and white thorn ceanothus.  Lodgepole pine and Jeffery pine occur in areas of high water tables."
