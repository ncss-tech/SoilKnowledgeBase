Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Innacutt soils are coarse-loamy, do not have diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons, and occur on inset fans and narrow flood plains of gulches.  Koshare soils are coarse-loamy and occur on toeslopes.  Quarteles soils are loamy, very shallow to soft bedrock, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on backslopes of ridges and hills.  Walkibout soils are coarse-silty, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on side slopes of gulches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 3 inches. (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 3 to 38 inches. (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)\nThe 11/2006 revision moves the type location to the typical pedon used in the update survey of the Santa Fe Area. The series range in characteristics was re-written to comprise only the soils in the Santa Fe update survey; these soils were proposed in 1996 as the Ulando series, before being dropped and correlated with El Rancho in 2006. When established the El Rancho series was classified as fine-loamy, mixed (calcareous), mesic Ustic Torriorthents.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
