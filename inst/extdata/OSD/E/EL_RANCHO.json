Koshare soils are coarse-loamy and occur on toeslopes.  Quarteles soils are loamy, very shallow to soft bedrock, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on backslopes of ridges and hills.  Walkibout soils are coarse-silty, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on side slopes of gulches."

(Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)\nThe 11/2006 revision moves the type location to the typical pedon used in the update survey of the Santa Fe Area. The series range in characteristics was re-written to comprise only the soils in the Santa Fe update survey; these soils were proposed in 1996 as the Ulando series, before being dropped and correlated with El Rancho in 2006. When established the El Rancho series was classified as fine-loamy, mixed (calcareous), mesic Ustic Torriorthents.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
