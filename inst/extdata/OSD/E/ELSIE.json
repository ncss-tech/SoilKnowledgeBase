Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay content and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 18 to 25 percent clay. It has 5 to 12 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam with 22 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has 0 to 10 percent paragravel.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.
