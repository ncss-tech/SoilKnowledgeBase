The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. The solum is extremely acid to strongly acid. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay content and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 18 to 25 percent clay. It has 5 to 12 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam with 22 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has 0 to 10 percent paragravel.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is loam or silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent paragravel."

The soils formed in mixed silty alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rock. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The frost-free period is 140 to 220 days."

Rinearson soils lack an argillic horizon and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock. Mayger and Rinearson soils occur on mountains, and Northrup soils occur on stream terraces."
