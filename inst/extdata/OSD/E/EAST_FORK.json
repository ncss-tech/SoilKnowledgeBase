Elevations range from 1,189 to 1,463 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  East Fork soils are used for irrigated cropland, wildlife habitat, and some livestock grazing.  Alfalfa, small grains, and grass-legume pastures are the principal crops.  The vegetation in rangeland is mainly basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye.  Saline-sodic areas have black greasewood and inland saltgrass."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (Ap and ABk horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 15 to 69 cm (ABk and Bk horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 91 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (C2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bk and C1 horizons and parts of the ABk and C2 horizons).\nThe revision of March 2000 moved the type location from Douglas County to a more representative area in Churchill County.  It also restricted the series concept to the warmer, drier portion of the climate range within MLRA 27 and updated the subgroup from fluvaquentic to oxyaquic.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled in 1959 and characterized by the soil survey laboratory in Riverside, CA as pedon 59NV001003 (pedon # 40A3247).  The data are published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 23 on page 209.  Another pedon has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE as user pedon ID 99NV001005 (pedon # 00P0243).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
