Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Oi, A horizons); an albic horizon from 8 to 25 inches; a cambic horizon from 25 to 60 inches (2E/Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 12 to 42 inches (2E1, 2E2, 2E/Bw horizons).  Evaro soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lamellic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lamellic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
