  "OVERVIEW": "The Esseville series consist of soils that are moderately deep to claystone, well drained soils that formed in very slowly permeable, moderately saline clayey fluviomarine sediments overlying clayey residuum derived from mudstone of tertiary age. These soils are on sideslopes of interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 544 mm (22 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
