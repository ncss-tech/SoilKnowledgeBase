Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3. Fiber content is 10 to 33 percent unrubbed and less than 10 percent after rubbing in the lower 8 inches of the horizon. Structure is coarse granular or massive. Soil reaction (calcium chloride) ranges from ultra acid (3.0) to strongly acid (5.5).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3. This horizon is a mixture of uncoated sand grains with organic matter. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. Sand grains are coated with organic matter. It has none to many small, black or dark reddish brown weakly cemented fragments in some part of the Bh horizon. Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand."
