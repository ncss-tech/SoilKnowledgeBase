    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to shale range from 40 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 9 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is loam or fine sandy loam.  Fragments of sandstone from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 5 to 25 percent by volume.  Fragments of sandstone from 76 mm to 25 cm in diameter make up 0 to 15 percent.  Stones make up 0 to 5 percent by volume.  Total coarse fragments make up 5 to 50 percent by volume. This horizon is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is similar to the A horizon in texture, content of coarse fragments, and reaction.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Some pedons have redoximorphic concentrations and depletions in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is silty clay or clay with a clay content commonly of 40 to 55 percent but ranging to 60 percent. Fragments of sandstone from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 10 percent by volume.  Fragments of sandstone from 76 mm to 25 cm make up 0 to 5 percent by volume.  Total coarse fragments make up 0 to 25 percent by volume.  This horizon is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8, or it is redoximorphic concentrations and depletions in shades of brown, red, and gray.  It is a silty clay or clay.  Fragments of sandstone or shale from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 20 percent by volume. Fragments of sandstone or shale from 76 mm to 25 cm in diameter make up 0 to 10 percent by volume.  Total coarse fragments make up 0 to 30 percent by volume.  This horizon is moderately acid through very strongly acid.\nThe 2Cr horizon is grayish or yellowish shale that is tilted 0 to 20 degrees from the horizontal.  It ranges from neutral to very strongly acid.\nSome pedons are underlain with a IIR layer of sandstone and shale."
