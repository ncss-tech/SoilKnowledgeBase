  "OVERVIEW": "The Envol series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from welded tuff. The Envol soils are on side slopes of foothills and mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
