  "OVERVIEW": "The Eastport series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits on vegetated beach ridges, plains near the Great Lakes or stabilized sand dunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",

Alpena soils are on lake benches and beach ridges. In addition Alpena soils are sandy-skeletal and East Lake soils have spodic horizons and have 2C horizons of gravelly sand with carbonates. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Roscommon soils are in lower landscape positions."
