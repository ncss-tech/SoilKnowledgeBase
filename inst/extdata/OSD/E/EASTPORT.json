    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Eastport soils are on vegetated beach ridges, plains and stabilized sand dunes along the Great Lakes. Slope gradients usually are between 4 and 18 percent and range from 0 to 45 percent. The soils formed in sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 838 mm (27 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alpena, Au Gres, East Lake, and Roscommon soils. The somewhat excessively drained East Lake soils are on adjoining outwash plains. Alpena soils are on lake benches and beach ridges. In addition Alpena soils are sandy-skeletal and East Lake soils have spodic horizons and have 2C horizons of gravelly sand with carbonates. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Roscommon soils are in lower landscape positions."

Small areas are in alfalfa or cherry orchards. Native vegetation is chiefly hard maple, beech, elm, ironwood, with some red pines and eastern hemlock."
