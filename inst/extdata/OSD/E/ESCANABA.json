  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 58 inches. The sandy upper part of the solum is 20 to 35 inches thick.  The solum ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the upper part and from slightly acid to neutral in the lower part.  The substratum is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 3 to 20 percent in the substratum.  Volume of cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Where present, the Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A horizon is sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Colors with chroma of 3 to 6 have value dry of 7 or more.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bs horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.\nThe 2E/B horizon consists of E material surrounding remnants of Bt horizon.  The E portion has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Colors with chroma of 2 to 6 have value dry of 7 or more.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand.  The Bt portion has colors and textures like the Bt horizon.  Some pedons have 2B/E horizons with similar colors and textures as the 2E/B horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. The average clay content of the 2Bt horizon ranges from 7 to 18 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. Small pockets of sand and gravel occur in some pedons."

Deford and Ensley soils are poorly drained and very poorly drained and are in depressions on nearby landscapes.  Emmet soils are generally finer textured in the upper part of the solum.  Pemene soils have coarser textured substratums.  Rousseau soils are sandy.  Emmet, Pemene, and Rousseau soils are adjacent to Escanaba soils and all are on similar landscape positions.  Solona and Wainola soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower areas adjacent to Escanaba soils."
