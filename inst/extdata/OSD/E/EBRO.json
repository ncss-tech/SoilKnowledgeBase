Logs, stumps, and fragments of wood that occupy 0 to 20 percent of the organic layers.  Mineral content of the Oa horizon is variable, but there is 40 percent or more mineral matter as a weighted average between the depths of 12 to 51 inches or there is a layer containing 40 to 80 percent mineral 6 inches or more thick between depths of 12 to 36 inches.  The mineral fraction is 75 percent or more silt and clay.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral (N), value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0.  Fiber content is less than 10 percent unrubbed and rubbed.  The organic layers are typically massive under natural wet conditions. Few to common flakes on specks of mica are present in some pedons."

Slopes are less than 1 percent."

The native vegetation is dominantly bald cypress and blackgum cypress being more common in areas that pond after flood water recedes.  Other hardwood trees such as red maple, sweetgum, red bay, sweetbay and water tupelo occur along stream and river banks and occupy less than 5 to 10 percent of the flood plains.  The understory consists of reeds, giant cane and greenbriar."

The type location from Walton County, Florida to Bay County, Florida.  Ebro soils originally mapped in Walton County were correlated as Maurepas because data showed the soils to be euic even though Maurepas soils are hyperthermic.\nThe water table is usually near or at the soil surface.  It is subject to flooding every year and lasts at least a month in most years.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
