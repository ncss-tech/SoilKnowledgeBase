    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout the control section for 90 consecutive days or more during the 4-month period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F.  Depth to very gravelly sand or coarse-textured material is 40 to 60 inches.  The upper 40 inches has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or fine sandy loam.  This horizon has weak platy or weak fine granular structure or is structureless.\nThe AC and C horizons have value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist; values of 6 dry and 4 moist are at depths below 20 inches.  These horizons are loam or fine sandy loam.  The AC horizon is replaced in some pedons with a B horizon having weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure.  The C horizon is mildly to moderately alkaline, and in places is stratified with thin lenses ranging from silt to loamy sand.  Rock fragments below depth of 40 inches range from 50 to 80 percent."

Leavenworth soils have chroma of 1 or 2 throughout the profiles, are moderately well drained, and have high water tables for short periods of time.  Narcisse soils are neutral to slightly acid throughout and are mottled in the control section.  Patit Creek soils are very gravelly in the lower part of the control section.  Pleasant View and Redola soils are calcareous throughout or in some part above depth of 40 inches.  Also, Redola soils are gravelly in the control section."

The soils formed in moderately coarse-textured alluvium from mixed materials including volcanic ash and loess.  The climate is semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean winter temperature is 34 to 36 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches.  The frost-free period is 140 to 170 days."
