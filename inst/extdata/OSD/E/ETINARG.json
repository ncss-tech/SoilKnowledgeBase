  "OVERVIEW": "The Etinarg series consists of very shallow and shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granite. Etinarg soils are on mountains and have slopes of 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
