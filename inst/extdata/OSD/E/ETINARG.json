Downeyville soils are calcareous in some part and moderately alkaline and strongly alkaline. Hoot soils have a soil temperature of 47 to 53 degrees F. Mirkwood soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments. Theon soils average 25 to 35 percent clay. Tognoni soils average 25 to 35 percent clay and is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Valleycity soils have a BCk horizon and formed in calcareous sandstone and shale. Vium soils have calcareous, moderately alkaline, 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 8 to 16 percent clay in the control section. Waucoba soils are 14 to 20 inches deep to bedrock."
