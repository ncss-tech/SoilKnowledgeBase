  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Escrito series consists of shallow, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability overlying very slowly permeable sandstone bedrock. This soil formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. Escrito soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
