  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Epvip soils are on mountains, hills and backslopes.  These soils formed in eolian volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and tuff-breccia.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,195 to 2,840 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
