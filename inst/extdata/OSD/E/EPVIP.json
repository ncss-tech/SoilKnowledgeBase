  "OVERVIEW": "The Epvip series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and tuff-breccia.  Epvip soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
