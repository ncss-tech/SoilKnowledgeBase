  "OVERVIEW": "The EVNA series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Evna soils are on mountains, hills, and benches.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
