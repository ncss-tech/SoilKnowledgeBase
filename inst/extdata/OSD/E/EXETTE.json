  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Exette series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on short, convex to linear side slopes and head slopes on uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).",
