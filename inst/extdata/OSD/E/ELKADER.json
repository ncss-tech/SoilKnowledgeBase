  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkader series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable upland soils.  They are formed in calcareous silty sediments from chalky limestone, shale, and loess.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 15 to 32 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  The calcium carbonate equivalent of the series control section averages 20 to 40 percent.  A few fragments of chalky limestone or shale, less than 3 inches across, occur in any horizon but are more common in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is dominantly silt loam, but is silty clay loam in some pedons.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and a chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have chalky limestone or shale at 40 to 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Ancho, Colmor, and Tilford series in the same family and the Armo, Manvel, Minnequa, and Wakeen series.  Ancho, Colmor, and Tilford soils have a lower average carbonate content in the control section.  In addition, Ancho and Colmor are in a dryer climate and Tilford soils have redder hues.  Armo and Wakeen soils are in a wetter climate.  In addition, Armo soils are fine-loamy and Wakeen soils have shale bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Manvel and Minnequa soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Also Minnequa soils have shale bedrock at 20 to 40 inches deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elkader soils are on slightly concave to plane side slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils are formed in calcareous silty sediments from chalky limestone, shale, and loess.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 21 inches.  The mean annual temperature at the type location is about 53 degrees F.  Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 30 to 34."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Manvel soils and Colby, Keith, Penrose, and Ulysses soils.  Manvel soils are in a similar position.  Colby, Keith, and Ulysses soils are in areas of thicker loess mantle generally on higher positions.  Colby soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Ulysses soils lack chalky limestone fragments.  Keith soils have argillic horizons.  Penrose soils are shallow and occur where the residuum is thin over chalky limestone."
