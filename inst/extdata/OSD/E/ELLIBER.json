  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  The top of the argillic horizon is 15 to 40 inches below the surface.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments are primarily siliceous siltstone and  chert but with some angular fine-grained  sandstone in the lower horizons. They range from 40 to 80 percent by volume in individual horizons of the soil and averages more than 50 percent in the top 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Some pedons have rock fragments of cherty siltstone. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid where unlimed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have E horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  The weighted average clay content in the top 20 inches of the Bt is 12 to 27 percent and sand content is greater than 20 percent.  Consistence is friable or firm. Clay films on faces of peds, in pores, and on rock fragments are in the middle and lower B horizons.\nTypically, the C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Blackthorn soils have rock fragments of sandstone and shale in the upper solum. Croom soils have gravelly very firm sandy clay loam Bt horizons and very gravelly loamy sand BC horizons containing rounded gravel.  Gainesboro, Hartleton, and Irondale soils soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Lew soils contain rock fragments of greenstone.  Mertz soils have less than 50 percent rock fragment content  and less than 27 percent clay in the upper Bt horizon.   Pattenburg soils have hue of 2.5YR or redder. Trevlac soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Weverton soils have rock fragments of quartzite, schist, and phyllite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elliber soils are on side slopes and tops of secondary ridges in the Appalacian Ridge and Valley  with a dominant slope range of 3 to 25 percent but the maximum exceeds 50 percent.  They are typically on  narrow to broad ridges of the Old Port Formation and Onondaga Formation.   Elliber soils formed in loamy, very cherty material weathered from silty cherts and  cherty limestone.  Some areas have been influenced by colluvial or glacial action.  The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 48 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 150 to 210 days."
