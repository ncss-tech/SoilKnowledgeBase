Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,495 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 250 to 360 mm but may range down to 200 mm in some areas in Lake County, Oregon. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, mean January temperatures are -3 to -2 degrees C, and mean July temperatures are 15 to 16 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
