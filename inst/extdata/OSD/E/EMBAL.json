  "OVERVIEW": "The Embal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and volcanic rocks. Embal soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
