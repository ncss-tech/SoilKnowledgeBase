  "OVERVIEW": "The Elocin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Elocin soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
