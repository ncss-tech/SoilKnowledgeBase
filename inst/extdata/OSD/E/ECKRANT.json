  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly rangeland and wildlife habitat. The climax plant community is a tall grass savannah with motts of live oak throughout the landscape. The dominant grasses are little bluestem and sideoats grama.  Other grasses include yellow Indiangrass, fall witchgrass, wildrye, green sprangletop, meadow dropseed, cane and pinhole bluestem, hairy grama, Texas wintergrass, curly mesquite and buffalograss. Woody plants include live oak, shin oak, evergreen sumac, hackberry, elbowbush, redbud, and white honeysuckle. Forbs, such as orange zexmenia, Engelmann daisy, bundleflower, snout bean, and bushsunflower, are present.  The site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population sideoats grama, buffalograss, hairy grama, dropseeds, and the woody plants. If this destructive grazing practice continues, the site will deteriorate to a plant population of Ashe juniper, Texas persimmon, live oak, Texas grama, hairy tridens, curly mesquite, threeawns, prairie coneflower, and broomweed."
