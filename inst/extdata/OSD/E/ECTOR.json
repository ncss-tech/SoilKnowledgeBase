  "OVERVIEW": "The Ector series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained soils that are moderately permeable above a moderately slowly permeable limestone bedrock. They formed in calcareous loamy residuum derived from limestone. These gently sloping to very steep soils occur on ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
