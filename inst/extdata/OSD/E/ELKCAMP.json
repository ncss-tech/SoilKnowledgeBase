The soils formed in slow-moving earthflows derived from sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1200 to 2550 millimeters (50 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 15 degree C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degree C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost free season is about 200 to 250 days."

Airstrip and Dolason soils lack an argillic horizon and lack redoximorphic features between the depths of 100 and 150 centimeters (30 to 60 inches). Airstrip soils are loamy-skeletal and 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a lithic contact. The Airstrip soils are on ridgetops and spur ridges. The Dolason soils are on smooth slopes alongside and above the Elkcamp soils."

Ultic feature - Base saturation is 35 to 75 percent throughout, and may be higher near the surface, reaches a minimum in the Bt and then increases with depth.\n4. Redoximorphic features - in the zone from 125 to 166 centimeters (Bt2 & Bt3 horizons)\n5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 20 to 70 centimeters, averages 30 percent clay, by field estimate, and 30 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.65\nADDITIONAL DATA: Gordon (1980) presented results of chemical analyses on samples (sample P 3) of Elkcamp soils.\nLiterature cited: Gordon, B.R., 1980.
