  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkcamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone. Elkcamp soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2290 millimeters (90 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

Ultic feature - Base saturation is 35 to 75 percent throughout, and may be higher near the surface, reaches a minimum in the Bt and then increases with depth.\n4. Redoximorphic features - in the zone from 125 to 166 centimeters (Bt2 & Bt3 horizons)\n5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 20 to 70 centimeters, averages 30 percent clay, by field estimate, and 30 percent rock fragments, by volume.
