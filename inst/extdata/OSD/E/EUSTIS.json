  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 60 inches or more.  Soil reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid\nthroughout.  The soil is dry for periods of less than 60 days in most years.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value 3 to 5, and chroma 3 or less.  Where value is 3 thickness is less than 8 inches.\nThe A21 horizon has hue 10YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma 2 to 4. The A22 horizon has hue 10YR to 5YR, value 3 to 5, and chroma 3 or more.  Texture of the A horizon ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon color is centered on hue 5YR, value 3 to 6, chroma 3 to 8 but hues range from 2.5YR to 10YR.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand and contains at least 3 percent more clay than the A2 horizon.  In some pedons, the Bt horizon occurs as bands or lamellae of loamy sand that total more than 6 inches thick within depths of 14 to 80 inches.  Silt and very fine sand plus clay range from 10 to 30 percent.  Clay content is at least 10 percent and typically ranges from 10 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue 5YR or 7.5YR, value 5 to 7, and chroma 6 or 8; or hue 10YR, value 5 and chroma 3 to 8, or value 7 or 8 and chroma 1 to 4.  Colors with value 7 or 8 and chroma 2 or less are due to uncoated sand grains and are not indicative of wetness.  In some pedons the C horizon is strongly mottled with yellow, brown, red, and white.  White mottles indicative of wetness are below depths of 72 inches."

Betis soils are dry in the moisture control section for more than 75 days.  Valdosta soils have less than 10 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Flomaton soils have more than 35 percent pebbles and cobbles in the argillic horizon."

Slopes are mainly 0 to 12 percent, but they are as much as 30 percent in highly dissected areas.  The regolith is thick coarse-textured marine or fluvial sediments.  Average annual precipitation is about 52 inches and average annual temperature is about 69 degrees F. near the type location."

Alaga soils have 10 to 25 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section and lack Bt horizons.  Dothan and Orangeburg soils have loamy Bt horizons within depths of 20 inches, Kenansville, Lucy, and Troup soils between depths of 20 to 40 inches, and Albany and Troup soils between depths of 40 to 80 inches.  In addition, Albany soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Chipley, Kershaw, and Lakeland soils all lack Bt horizons.  In addition, Chipley soils are somewhat poorly drained, Kershaw soils are in an uncoated family, and Lakeland\nsoils have 5 to 10 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section."
