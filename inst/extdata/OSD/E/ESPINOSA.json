  "REVDATE": "06/2005",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Espinosa series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on valleys in coastal plains.  They formed in fine textured sediments of mixed origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",

Organic carbon content in the upper 6 inches of the argillic horizon is less than 0.9 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  The lower Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and yellow, and below 40 inches, gray range from none to common.  Texture is clay."

Vega Alta soils are on similar positions but have parasesquic mineralogy."
