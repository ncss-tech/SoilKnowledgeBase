Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  The lower Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and yellow, and below 40 inches, gray range from none to common.  Texture is clay."

Almirante and Bayamon soils are on similar positions, have more clay in the control section, and are Oxisols.  In addition, Almirante soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite in some horizons.  Vega Alta soils are on similar positions but have parasesquic mineralogy."
