  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkriver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and moderately well drained soils that formed in postglacial alluvium consisting of a coarse-loamy mantle and underlying sandy sediments on flood plains. These soils have moderate and moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
