  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elkriver soils have slightly concave to linear slopes on flood plains. They formed in postglacial alluvial sediments consisting of a coarse-loamy mantle and underlying sandy sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 900 to 1100 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fordum, Hubbard, Sandberg, Winterfield, and Zimmerman soils. Fordum soils are very poorly drained and poorly drained and are lower lying on the floodplain. Winterfield soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a sandy particle size. Hubbard, Sandberg, and Zimmerman soils are excessively drained soils on nearby terraces or outwash plains that do not flood."

Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid in lower part. The moderately well drained phase has an apparent water table at a depth of 3 to 5 feet from November to June in normal years. The somewhat poorly drained phase has an apparent water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3 feet from November to June in normal years."
