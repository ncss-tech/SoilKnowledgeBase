  "OVERVIEW": "The Evridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loamy material derived from soft sandstone and shale.  Permeability is moderately rapid above the B horizon and slow in the B horizon.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to soft bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedons is 7 to 16 inches.  Where moist colors darker than 3.5 extend below depths of 16 inches, organic carbon is less than .6 percent.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon typically is fine sandy loam, but some pedons are loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand. It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but some pedons are very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It has moderate to strong medium to very coarse columnar structure.  Carbonates are in the lower B horizon in some pedons.  The SAR is 10 to 20.  It ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have loamy sand and loamy fine sand BC horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam and is 60 to 80 percent by volume soft weathered rock fragments.  It has few to common accumulations of carbonates.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have salts below a depth of 20 inches.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color and texture of the B or BC horizons.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 8 and 2 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is soft sandstone.  Some pedons may have thin layers of siltstone or shale.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline.  The upper part typically contains carbonates."

The Ekalaka soil is on similar landscape positions and is in complex with the Evridge soils in some areas.  Bullock and Parchin soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are in the fine-loamy family.  Rhoades soils are fine textured.  The Bullock, Parchin, and Rhoades soils are on lower parts of the landscape.  The Parshall, Tally, and Vebar soils do not have natric horizons.  Parshall soils are in swales, Tally soils are on terraces, and Vebar soils are on nearby uplands."
