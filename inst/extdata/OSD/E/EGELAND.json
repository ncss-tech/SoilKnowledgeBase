  "OVERVIEW": "The Egeland series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits. These soils are on terraces, outwash plains, and uplands. They have moderately rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual air precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Eckman soils have a coarse-silty particle size control section.  Maddock soils have a sandy particle size control section.  Embden and Swenoda soils are on foot slopes below the Egeland soils.  They have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Fordville and Renshaw soils are on nearby terraces and outwash plains.  They are fine-loamy over sand and gravel.  The Forman, Peever, and Poinsett soils are on nearby glacial till plains.  Forman and Peever soils have an argillic horizon.  Poinsett soils have a fine-silty series control section."
