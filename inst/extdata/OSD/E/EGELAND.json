Egeland soils formed in moderately coarse-textured glaciofluvial deposits and sandy materials of fans and beaches of lake plains.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 36 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Growing season is 120 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3500."

Eckman soils have a coarse-silty particle size control section.  Maddock soils have a sandy particle size control section.  Embden and Swenoda soils are on foot slopes below the Egeland soils.  They have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Fordville and Renshaw soils are on nearby terraces and outwash plains.  They are fine-loamy over sand and gravel.  The Forman, Peever, and Poinsett soils are on nearby glacial till plains.  Forman and Peever soils have an argillic horizon.  Poinsett soils have a fine-silty series control section."
