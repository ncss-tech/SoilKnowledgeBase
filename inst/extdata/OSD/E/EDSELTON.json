  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edselton soils are in shallow closed depressions primarily on outwash plains, lake plains, lake terraces, and flood plains, but can occur within moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Edselton soils formed in herbaceous organic material overlying marly material and sand deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 76 to 107 cm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

These very poorly drained soils are on similar landform positions as Edselton soils. Adrian and Antung soils formed in herbaceous organic material over sandy material. Edwards soils do not have sand within 130 cm (51 inches). Houghton soils formed in herbaceous organic material more than 130 cm (51 inches) thick. Madaus and Martisco soils formed in less than 41 cm (16 inches) of herbaceous organic material over marly material. Moston and Toto soils formed in herbaceous organic material over coprogenous earth."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic material, moderately low in the marly material, and high or very high in the underlying sand. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material, slow in the marly material, and rapid in the underlying sand."
