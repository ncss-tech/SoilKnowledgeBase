  "OVERVIEW": "The Exeter series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium mainly from granitic sources.  Exeter soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

Moist colors are generally 1 or 2 units of value less and are the same or are 1 unit of chroma less than dry colors.\nTexture: Loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nClay content: 18 to 35 percent clay.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.\nBqm Horizon--10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6; 5YR 5/3, 5/4 or 5/6 dry. Moist colors are generally 1 or 2 units of value less and are the same or are 1 unit of chroma less than dry colors.\nOther features: In some pedons, the duripan is capped with a thin layer of carbonates or the carbonates may be segregated as few, fine seams or filaments in fine fractures, but the duripan matrix is always noncalcareous.\nThe 2C1 and 2C2 horizons are variable.  They usually consist of sand or gravelly sand underlain by stratified layers of sandy loam to silt loam.   Some pedons have buried 2Bt and 2Btk horizons underlying the duripan that are stratified very gravelly loamy coarse sand to loam with 15 to 50 percent pebbles and 2 to 15 percent clay.  Carbonates may be present in these horizons as few soft masses or disseminated."

Fiddyment soils have very thin duripans underlain directly by a paralithic contact and have an abrupt clay increase of 15 to 25 percent within one inch above the duripan.  Monserate soils are slightly acid to neutral in the argillic horizon, do not have less than 27 percent clay in the Bt, and have an abrupt clay increase with at least a 10 percent increase from the A to the Bt. Rocklin series have cementation below the indurated duripan and textures below the duripan are not sandy."

The soils formed in alluvium mainly form granitic sources.  In most areas the hummocky relief has been smoothed by leveling.  The climate is dry subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 20 inches.  The average January temperature is 46 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 82 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."
