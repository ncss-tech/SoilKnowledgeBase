  "OVERVIEW": "The Eleroy series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on structural benches and rounded ridgetops. These soils formed loess and residuum from calcareous clayey shale.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
