Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7.2  to 13.9 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches)."

Fayette and Rozetta soils are on ridges or sides slopes at higher elevations and do not have bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Keltner and Massbach soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Eleroy soils and have mollic epipedons."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained--a saturated zone occurs within depths of 2 to 3.5 feet during March to June in most years and is considered perched. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and low to moderately low (0.01 to 0.42 micrometers per second) in the residuum. Permeability is moderate in the loess and very slow in the residuum.  The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high."
