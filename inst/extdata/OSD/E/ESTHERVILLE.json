  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Estherville series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loamy sediments over sandy and gravelly outwash. These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, valley trains, and kames on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
