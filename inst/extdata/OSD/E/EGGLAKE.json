  "OVERVIEW": "The Egglake series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in glacial till on moraines.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches or more. Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise about 2 to 10 percent of the volume in all horizons.\nSome pedons have an O horizon as much as 2 inches thick consisting mainly of forest litter, principally leaves, twigs, and fine roots.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  In cultivated pedons the Ap horizon has value of 5 or less when dry.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features in some to all parts.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  It averages 18 to 30 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent sand.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bkg and Cg horizon (when present) has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It averages 10 to 18 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent sand."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Egglake soils have plane to slightly concave slopes or are in closed depressions on moraines.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  They formed in calcareous glacial till of Late Wisconsin Age.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 27 inches.  Frost free days range from 90 to 130 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1800 feet."
