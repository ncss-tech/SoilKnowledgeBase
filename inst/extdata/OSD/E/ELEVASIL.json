  "OVERVIEW": "The Elevasil series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone on hills and pediments on bedrock controlled uplands.  These soils formed mostly in siliceous loamy colluvium or slope alluvium over siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle; rapid in the sandy residuum; and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth in the following paragraph are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to a paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 17 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent fine or coarser sand and has less than 10 percent weatherable minerals (0.02 to 20 mm fraction).  Coarse fragments consist entirely of sandstone fragments.  Volume of sandstone channers typically ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle but ranges up to 35 percent in individual subhorizons in some pedons.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the sandy residuum.  Some map units have 1 to 3 percent stones on the surface.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  The O horizon is a layer of moderately decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have Ap horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, loam, or the channery analogs.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, loam, or the channery analogs.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Volume of sandstone flagstones ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with color, texture, and reaction like the 2BC horizon below.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand, or the channery analogs.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Volume of sandstone flagstones ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sand, fine sand, or the channery analogs. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Volume of sandstone flagstones ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2C horizon described above.  It is sandstone and is a paralithic contact but grades to a lithic contact below 40 inches in some pedons."
