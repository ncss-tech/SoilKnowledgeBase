Organic matter is 10 to 15 percent.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam. Clay content is from 27 to 35 percent. It has 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel.  It has a moist bulk density of 1.2 to 1.3 grams/cubic centimeter. Reaction is extremely acid, very strongly acid or stongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 8 moist and dry. It is variegated in some pedons. Texture is fine sandy loam,  clay loam and in some areas ranges to stratified loam and fine sandy loam. Clay content is 10 to 35 percent. It has 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel.. Reaction is extremely acid, very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry. It is variegated in some pedons. Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, or extremely gravelly sandy loam. Clay content is 3 to 10 percent. It has 0 to 35 percent rounded gravel and ranges to 55 percent below a depth of 40 inches, 0 to 15 percent rounded cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent rounded paragravel.
