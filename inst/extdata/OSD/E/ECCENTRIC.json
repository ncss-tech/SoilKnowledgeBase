    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nPSCS depth: The zone from 35 to 110 cm. (part of E1, E2 and E/Bt horizon)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 84 cm.  (Oi, Oe, A, E1, E2)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 84 to 152 cm. (E/Bt horizon)\nThe E/Bt horizon has a weighted average clay content of 2 to 9 percent, and does not meet the 3 percent absolute clay increase requirement for an argillic horizon.\nDepending on the clay content in the Bt part, the Bt part would likely need to occupy 25 percent or more by volume of the E/Bt horizon matrix, in order to have the weighted average clay increase needed to qualify as an argillic horizon.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
