  "OVERVIEW": "The Eccentric series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Eccentric soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. (43 F)",

(E/Bt horizon)\nThe E/Bt horizon has a weighted average clay content of 2 to 9 percent, and does not meet the 3 percent absolute clay increase requirement for an argillic horizon.\nDepending on the clay content in the Bt part, the Bt part would likely need to occupy 25 percent or more by volume of the E/Bt horizon matrix, in order to have the weighted average clay increase needed to qualify as an argillic horizon.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014."
