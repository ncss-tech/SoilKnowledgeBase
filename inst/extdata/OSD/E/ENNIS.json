  "OVERVIEW": "The Ennis series consists of very deep, well drained to somewhat excessively drained, gravelly soils with moderately rapid permeability. These soils formed in gravelly alluvial sediments derived from soils that formed in limestone, shale, and sandstone. Ennis soils are on flood plains and in narrow strips along drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent, but commonly are less than 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Fragments of dominantly chert gravel and cobbles ranges from 15 percent to 35 percent in the A and Bw horizons, and 15 to 75 percent in the C horizon. The presence of buried horizons in the subsoil is common.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or rarely sandy loam. In a few pedons, the A horizon has a thin strata of recent overwash of yellowish red gravelly silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the fine earth texture is silt loam, loam, and rarely clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Ab horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is at depths ranging from 25 to 50 inches. Texture of the fine earth texture is silt loam, loam, and rarely clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. In most pedons, there are mottles in shades of yellow and brown. Redoximorphic depletions may occur below 40 inches in some pedons. Texture of the fine earth texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or rarely clay loam and sandy loam."
