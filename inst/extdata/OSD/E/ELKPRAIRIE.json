  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkprairie series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over older weathered volcanic ash and pumice on terraces  and hillslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 2,600 to 4,700 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 120 to 135 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Elkprairie soils formed in fresh volcanic ash and pumice over older soils formed from volcanic ash and pumice.  The upper 20 to 35 inches of the profile is ejecta from the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 120 to 135 inches including snow cover from November to June.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 53 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is about 38 to 42 degrees F.  The growing season is 75 to 95 days."
