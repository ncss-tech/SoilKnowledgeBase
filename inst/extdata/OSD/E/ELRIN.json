  "OVERVIEW": "The Elrin series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately over rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium on low stream benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is greater than 48 inches.  Free carbonates and pebbles typically are absent to a depth of 5 feet or more but, in some pedons, are as shallow as 4 feet.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 14 and 18 percent clay.  Depth to the loamy sand ranges from 30 to 48 inches.  The lower part of the A horizon and the B horizon range from slightly acid to strongly acid.  The Ap or A horizon is black (10YR 2/1), very dark brown (10YR 2/2), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2); and is loam or silt loam high in sand.  The AB horizon, when present, is dark brown (10YR 3/3) or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  The Bw horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  If the matrix color is 3 chroma, there are mottles of 2 chroma.  Mottles with hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y commonly are present.  It is loam in the upper part and sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the lower part.  There is a sandy loam horizon at least 6 inches thick between the loam and loamy sand horizons.  The BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4 and is mottled similar to the B2 horizon.  The BC horizon generally is loamy sand but loamy fine sand, sandy loam, and sand are permitted."

The Linder soils have a solum typically thinner than 30 inches and contain 5 to 30 percent gravel below a depth of about 36 inches.  Wesley soils formed in coarse textured material overlying lake sediments or glacial till.  Yahara soils have a thinner solum, free carbonates within a depth of 24 inches, and are underlain by stratified silts and very fine sands."
