  "OVERVIEW": "The Eloma series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite and gneiss. Eloma soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 1 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about l4 inches (356 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F (17.3 degrees C).",
