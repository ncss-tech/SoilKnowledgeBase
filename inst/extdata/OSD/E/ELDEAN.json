Lamoille and Upshur soils are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section with sandy textures. Paintcreek soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 91 cm (36 inches). Woodsfield soils have rock fragments dominantly of shale, siltstone, and sandstone in the lower part of the series control section."

They formed in outwash materials dominantly of limestone origin and are moderately deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. In some places, the upper part of the solum formed in silty or loamy alluvium or in loess as much as 46 cm (18 inches) thick. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F)."

If true, a clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size family might be more appropriate.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap, BA horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 58 cm (Bt horizon).\nCalcareous sandy and gravelly material: at 76 cm (top of the C horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory are available for pedons BR-5, CL-5, CH-13, LG-35, MA-14, and UN-27.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
