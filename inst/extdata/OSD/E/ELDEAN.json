  "OVERVIEW": "The Eldean series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly material. They formed in outwash materials dominantly of limestone origin on outwash terraces, kames, and moraines. In some places, the upper part of the solum formed in silty or loamy alluvium or in loess as much as 46 cm (18 inches thick). Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
