  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A1 and B2t horizons and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The B2t horizon may extend into cracks in the limestone bedrock.  Rock fragments are dominantly angular cobble and gravel size limestone fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 46 to 53 degrees F.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is slightly or medium acid.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has value of 4 moist below a depth of 20 inches.  This horizon ranges from cobbly and cobbly silty clay loam to very gravelly heavy loam with more than 18 percent clay.  It averages more than 35 percent cobbles and gravel in the upper 20 inches of the horizon.  The B2t horizon has moderate to weak, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure and has thin common to continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

Bickmore, Blaine, Buena Vista, Nathrop, Rammel, and Thiel soils have horizons of carbonbate accumulation.  Also, Bickmore soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 16 inches.  Ess, Hourglass, Libeg, Tahquats, and Thiel soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Mult soils have less than 15 percent cobbles and gravel in the argillic horizon.  Woodhall soils have rock fragments that are mainly more than 10 inches in diameter and lack limestone fragments."

They formed in residuum and colluvium form limestone.  The climate is moist subhumid, with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 32 to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F.  The frost free season is 75 to 90 days."
