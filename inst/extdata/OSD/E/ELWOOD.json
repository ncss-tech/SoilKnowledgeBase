  "OVERVIEW": "The Elwood series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from derived from limestone. These soils are on moderately steep to very steep mountain slopes. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
