  "OVERVIEW": "The Earsman series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from calcareous sandstone and quartzite.  Earsman soils are on mountain hillsides and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Sandstone channers in the particle size control section range from 35 to 70 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges 44 to 46 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperatures ranges 59 to 65 degrees F.  Clay content in the particle-size conrol section ranges from 5 to l8 percent, silt from 20 to 50 percent and sand from 35 to 65 percent, with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hues of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is mildly through strongly alkaline.\nThe AC horizon, if present, has hues of 5YR through 10R, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is mildly through strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk or C horizon, if present, has hues of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Fine earth is sandy loam or loam.  Soil Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic features are a lithic contact at 18 inches.  After the Earsman series was reclassified, it was found to be very similar to the Bloodstone series.  Further investigation is needed to determine if the two series should be combined.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nPrevious classification:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Lithic Ustic Torriorthents.  Updated the soil classification to better reflect the soil moisture regime concept."
