  "OVERVIEW": "The Ekah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium from tertiary aged sediments. These soils  are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
