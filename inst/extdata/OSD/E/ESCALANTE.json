  "OVERVIEW": "The Escalante series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. Escalante soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains, inset fans, fan aprons, fan skirts, and fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
