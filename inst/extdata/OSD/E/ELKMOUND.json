  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development and depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone range from 10 to 20 inches. Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 20 percent. Volume of sandstone channers or other gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the A or Ap horizon. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the Bw horizon and volume of other gravel from 0 to 20 percent. Volume of cobbles or sandstone flagstones ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Where value moist is 3, value dry is 6 or more. Uncultivated pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is loam or sandy loam or the gravelly analogues.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is the same as the Ap or A horizon above.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 through 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is loam or sandy loam or the gravelly analogues.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or fine sand.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2BC horizon. It is weakly cemented sandstone with horizontal cleavage. In some areas the sandstone formations contain thin, hard, iron-cemented layers."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. Related series in other families are Basehor, Boone, Hixton, Northfield, and Ramsey.    Basehor, Boone, and Ramsey soils are siliceous.  Hixton and Northfield soils have an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elkmound soils are on convex slopes on upland ridges underlain by sandstone, but in some places are on lake terraces. In Dunn County, Elkmound soils are in previously glaciated, bedrock controlled landscapes and typically on the Eau Claire and Mt. Simon formations. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Elkmound soils formed in a mixture of loess, slope alluvium, and residuum underlain by sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to about 35 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to about 51 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  There is some question as to whether the mineralogy would be best characterized as siliceous rather than mixed mineralogy.\n2006 - Due to the shale seams that are common to the Eau Claire and Mt. Simon Formations, it remains classified as mixed. In Dunn, Chippewa, and Eau Claire Counties, previous glacial ice events provided the Precambrian rock fragments that are commonly on the surface of and mixed in the Elkmound soil.\nThis revision provides a new typical pedon in Dunn County which gets the type location back to where it was originally proposed. This revision also changes the bedrock from R to Cr which in turn changes the classification from Lithic Dystrudepts to Typic Dystrudepts. Field study is needed to determine if Elkmound mapped in other counties is on different unglaciated bedrock formations where the soil may be siliceous.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 6 inches (Ap);\ncambic horizon - 6 to 12 inches (Bw);\nother features - paralithic contact - 12 inches (Cr).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
