    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. In closely related families are the Flatrock, Lobdell, and Weaver series. Flatrock and Lobdell soils do not have carbonates above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and are in the active cation-exchange activity class. Weaver soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches) and are in the active cation-exchange activity class."
