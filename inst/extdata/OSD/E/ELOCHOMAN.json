The mean annual precipitation is 70 to l20 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 12 inches and a cambic horizon from 12 to 60 inches.  The series type location occurs in the isomesic soil temperature regime area.  However, most of the soil series is mapped in the mesic soil temperature regime.  The series type location should probably be moved during the MLRA update.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available number S84WA-069-002. Riverside laboratory data are also available on this soil: sample numbers R74-l52 to l54. R75-l27 and l30, and S77WA25-6.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
