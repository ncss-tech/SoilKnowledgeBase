They formed in slope alluvium and eolian deposits over residuum derived from Permian age sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,700 to 8,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Altezita soils are loamy, very shallow, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on adjacent summits of plateaus.  Estrada soils are fine-loamy, are very deep, have a thick mollic epipedon, and occur on footslopes and toeslopes.  Herrada soils are fine-silty, very deep, have mixed mineralogy, and occur on shoulders and summits.  Sabroso soils are loamy-skeletal, are very deep, and occur on steep south-facing backslopes.  Verano soils are loamy-skeletal, have a mollic epipedon, and occur on steep north-facing backslopes."
