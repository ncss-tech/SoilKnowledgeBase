  "OVERVIEW": "The Esquila series consists of shallow over sandstone bedrock, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Esquila soils are on lower summit areas of plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
