  "OVERVIEW": "The Ensenada series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on fluvial deposits adjacent to limestone hills in coastal plains.  They formed in fluvial deposits.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is 80 degrees F.",
