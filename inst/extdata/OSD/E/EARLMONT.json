The control section contains less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand, 22 to 32 percent clay, and less than 5 percent coarse fragments.  The soil is strongly acid at the surface and very strongly acid in the subsoil.\nThe Ap horizon has moderately coarse and very coarse granular structure.\nThe B horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2 and 2.5Y 6/2), with fine and medium, distinct and prominent redox concentrations.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has moderate to strong very coarse prismatic structure.\nThe C horizon has layers of volcanic ash, peat, muck, and diatomite.  Some pedons contain gravel lenses below a depth of 4 feet."
