  "OVERVIEW": "The Esplin series consists of shallow over indurated carbonate hardpan, well drained soils that formed in igneous rocks. The Esplin soils are on lava flows and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",
