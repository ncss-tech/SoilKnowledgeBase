Coarse fragments range from 35 to 75 percent by weighted volume in the profile, and range 25 to 80 percent by volume in individual horizons. The depth to the top of the fragipan is 20 to 30 inches. The control section averages 8 to 15 percent clay. The soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid. If areas are limed soil reaction ranges to moderately acid.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3. The texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and their stony or rubbly modifiers. Structure is weak fine and medium granular.\nThe B horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 with some small areas of chroma 3 and high chroma redoximorphic concentrations. The texture of the B is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak medium and coarse subangular blocky.\nThe Bx horizons have hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loam or sandy loam. Structure is moderate very coarse prismatic, parting to moderate to strong coarse and very coarse platy, or it is massive within the prisms."
