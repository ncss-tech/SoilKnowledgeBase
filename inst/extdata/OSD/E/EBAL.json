  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 50 to 90 inches.  Clay content in the particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent and sand content averages 10 to 25 percent.\nThe upper part of the control section (A, Ap horizons) has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam averaging less than 18 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent sand.  Rock fragments average 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe second part of the control section (BE, Bt horizons) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam and the channery or very channery analogues of these textures.  Clay content averages 18 to 30 percent and sand content averages 20 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments average 0 to 40 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe third part of the control section (2Bt. 2BC horizons) has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam.  Clay content averages 45 to 60 percent and sand content averages 10 to 20 percent.  Rock fragments average 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe lower part of the control section (2Cr) has a hue 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1."

Aaron, Alsup, Derinda, Losantville, and Miamian soils have solums less than 50 inches thick.  Brookside soils have more than 5 pecent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Purdin and Winnegan soils contain concentrations of carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Vincent soils do not have rock fragments in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ebal soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of structural scarps and benches, and on hills.  The slopes range from 10 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in 10 to 30 inches of colluvium from siltstone and the underlying residuum weathered from interbedded shale and sandstone and can be capped with up to 10 inches of loess.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

The well drained moderately deep Adeyville, Berks, Gilpin, and somewhat excessively drained Tipsaw soils are typically on shoulders and backslopes.  The well drained, more permeable Wellston soils are on similar topographic positions as Ebal soils.  The well drained moderately deep Caneyville, and deep or very deep Hagerstown soils are on hills underlain with limestone berock."
