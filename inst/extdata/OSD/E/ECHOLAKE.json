  "OVERVIEW": "The Echolake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale.  Echolake soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
