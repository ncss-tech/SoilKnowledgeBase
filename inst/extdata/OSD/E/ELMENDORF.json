  "OVERVIEW": "The Elmendorf series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous, clayey residuum weathered from shale. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 885 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
