  "OVERVIEW": "The Ellett series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale.  Ellett soils are on rolling hillsides and foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean summer temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section (4 to 14 inches) more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., and is dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the 4 months following the summer solstice in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is paragravelly loam, very paragravelly loam, silt loam or cobbly loam and has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry and moist.  It is loam, silt loam, paragravelly loam or clay loam and averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 10 to 30 percent shale fragments."
