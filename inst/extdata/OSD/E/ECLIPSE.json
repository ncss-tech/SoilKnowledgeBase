  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F in parts of January and February.   The soil between the depths of 11 and 41 inches is usually dry in all parts from May 1 to November 30.  It is usually continuously moist for less than 75 days during the remainder of the year.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline in the surface and moderately to very strongly alkaline below.  EC ranges from 0 to 8.  Sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 1 to 12 with a bulge of 5 to 12 in the B horizon and upper C horizon.\nThe A horizon is 5Y 6/2, 7/2; 2.5Y 6/2 or 7/2.  Moist color is 5Y 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/4.  Textures are sand and loamy sand.  It has 0 to 6 percent clay content and 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  It is noneffervescent to strongly effervescent.  Electrical conductivity is 0 to 8 dS/m.  Sodium adsorption ratio is 1 to 12.  Most pedons have an AB or A2 horizon that is loamy sand with 5 to 8 percent clay content.\nThe Bt horizon is 5Y 6/2, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2 or 7/2.  Moist color is 5Y 4/3, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/4.  It has 6 to 10 percent clay content and 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  It is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.  Electrical conductivity is 2 to 8 dS/m.  Sodium adsorption ratio is 5 to 12.\nThe C horizon is 5Y 6/2, 7/2; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4 or 7/2.  Moist color is 5Y 4/3, 4/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4 or 5/4.  It is typically stratified with textures ranging from gravelly coarse sand to fine sandy loam with 0 to 10 percent clay content.  It averages coarser than loamy fine sand. Some pedons have thin stratas below 40 inches with loam, silt loam or clay loam textures.  Electrical conductivity is 2 to 8 dS/m.  Sodium adsorption ratio is 1 to 12."

Elevation is 3,600 to 4,100 feet. The climate is arid with hot dry summers, and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches.  The average annual temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 81 degrees F, and mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 150 to 225 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Eclipse soil has a 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section.  Even though the cambic horizon has a sandy loam texture, it is not thick enough to take the soil out of the sandy family.\nDiagnostic horizons in the pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to about 13 inches (A and AB horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from about 13 to 18 inches (Bt horizon).\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 9/1996. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
