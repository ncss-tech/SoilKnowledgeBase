  "OVERVIEW": "The Earp series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in cobbly and gravelly coarse-textured old valley filling materials from quartzite, andesite, and granite with some dolomitic marble on old alluvial fans. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

Dominant slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in cobbly and gravelly coarse-textured old valley filling materials from quartzite, andesite, and granite with some dolomitic marble.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, about 1/2 of which comes as summer thundershowers in July, August, and September.  The mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 65 degrees F. and the frost-free season is 155 to 175 days."

Kimbrough soils lack a B horizon and have a petrocalcic horizon at shallow depths.  White House soils have fine textured B horizons and contain less than 35 percent rock fragments."
