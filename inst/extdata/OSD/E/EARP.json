  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Earp soils are on deeply dissected, moderately sloping to moderately steep old alluvial fans at elevations ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 feet.  Dominant slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in cobbly and gravelly coarse-textured old valley filling materials from quartzite, andesite, and granite with some dolomitic marble.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, about 1/2 of which comes as summer thundershowers in July, August, and September.  The mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 65 degrees F. and the frost-free season is 155 to 175 days."

Kimbrough soils lack a B horizon and have a petrocalcic horizon at shallow depths.  White House soils have fine textured B horizons and contain less than 35 percent rock fragments."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment. The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.
