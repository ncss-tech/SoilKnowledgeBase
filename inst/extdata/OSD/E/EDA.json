  "OVERVIEW": "The Eda series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits on dunes and side slopes in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in).",
