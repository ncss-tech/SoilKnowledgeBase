Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizon except where limed or irrigated with alkaline artesian water, and extremely acid to slightly alkaline in all other horizons. In some areas, limestone bedrock is at a depth of 50 to 80 inches. Boulders and cobbles throughout the solum range from none to few.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1.  Undisturbed, it is a mixture of clean sand grains and organic matter. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 5. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of brown, red, or yellow, range from none to common. Texture is sand or fine sand. In depressional areas, thin muck surfaces may occur.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. Sand grains are well coated with organic matter. Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Weakly cemented fragments of Bh horizon range from none to common. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizons, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow and brown range from none to common. Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E' horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe EB' horizon, where present is above the Btg horizon. It has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam. Lenses and pockets of sand or sandy loam range from none to common.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3; or there is no dominant color and it is mixed in shades of yellow, brown, and gray. Texture ranges from sand to fine sandy loam."

Delray soils have mollic epipedons, have surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness and do not have spodic horizons. Farmington and Oldsmar soils have A and E horizons more than 30 inches thick. Pepper soils are cemented (ortstein) in the Bh horizon. Pomona soils have less than 35 percent base saturation in the Btg horizon. Wabasso soils are on similar positions and have an argillic horizon within a depth of 37 inches."
