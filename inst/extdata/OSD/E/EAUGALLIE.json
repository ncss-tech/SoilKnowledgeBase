  "OVERVIEW": "The EauGallie series consists of very deep, very poorly or poorly drained, slowly permeable soils in flats, sloughs and depressional areas in the Southern Florida Flatwoods (MLRA 155) and to a lesser extent in the Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 153A), the South Central Florida Ridge, (MLRA 154) and the Southern Florida Lowlands (MLRA 156B). They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments in Peninsula Florida. Near the type location, the man annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the man annual precipitation is about 55 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
