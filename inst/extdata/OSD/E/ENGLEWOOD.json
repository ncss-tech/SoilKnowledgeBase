  "OVERVIEW": "The Englewood series consists of deep, well to moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvial parent materials weathered from adjacent sedimentary bedrock.  They are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Content of coarse fragments is typically less than 5 percent and ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mottling ranges from none to a few small weak mottles with chroma of more than 2.  The solum and the C horizons are uniform with only minor stratification.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 7 dry, 2 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and has 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 60 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.   This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and has 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 60 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.   This horizon is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline and contains 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons lack at C horizon."
