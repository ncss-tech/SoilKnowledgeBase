  "OVERVIEW": "The Edfro series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils formed in a mixture of volcanic ash, loess, and colluvium, and alpine glacial till derived from dunite.  Edfro soils are on glacially modified mountain shoulder slopes and backslopes.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
