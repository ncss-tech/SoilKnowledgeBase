  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Edfro soils are on glacially modified mountain shoulder slopes at elevations of 2,400 to 3,600 feet.  The soils in formed a mixture of volcanic ash, loess, and colluvium, and alpine glacial till derived dominately from dunite.  Edfro soils are in a marine climate with cool dry summers and cold wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from November through May.  Mean annual precipitation is 90 to l05 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 29 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to l05 days."
