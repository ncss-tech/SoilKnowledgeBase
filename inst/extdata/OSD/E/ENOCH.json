  "OVERVIEW": "The Enoch series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability formed in ultra acid regolith from surface mine operations.  The regolith is a mixture of partially weathered fine earth and fragments of bedrock.  Fragments of bedrock are mostly shales, medium and coarse grained sandstone, and small amounts of fine grained sandstone, siltstone, and coal.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction is ultra acid (pH of 1.5 to 3.5) except for surface layers that have been reclaimed.  Sulfides are present in some coarse fragments of shale and sandstone.  The average content of rock fragments in the control section is 35 to 50 percent by volume.  Rock fragments are mostly in the 2mm to 25 cm range but include stones and boulders.  In most places, the coarser grained sandstone and soft shale have weak coherence.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 through 6; and chroma of 0 through 6.  It is shaly, very shaly, channery, or very channery analogues of loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with an average clay content of about 30 percent.  The reclaimed phase has an A horizon from natural soil material, 6 to 12 inches thick.  It is clay loam, silt loam, loam, or their channery or shaly analogues.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 50 percent by volume except on the reclaimed phase that is less than 20 percent.  A very stony phase is recognized.\nThe C horizon has hue from 7.5YR to 5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 through 6; and chroma of 0 through 8.  It is mainly very shaly or very channery analogues of loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Many pedons have subhorizons of extremely shaly or extremely channery analogues of clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume in individual horizons.  Clay content averages about 30 percent."

The Bethesda, Fairpoint, Fiveblock, Itmann, Kaymine, Morristown, and Sewell soils are in related families.  Barkcamp, Itmann, and Sewell soils have less than 18 percent clay.   In addition, Barkcamp and Sewell soils have coarse fragments dominated by sandstone.  Bethesda and Cedarcreek soils are strongly acid to extremely acid, and in addition; Cedarcreek soils have mixed mineralogy, have fine earth mainly of silt loam, and loa, and are more permeable.  Fairpoint, Fiveblock, and Kaymine siols are nonacid.  Morristown soils are calcareous."

The soils formed in ultra acid, relatively unweathered broken bedrock and partly weathered fines.  This regolith is spoil from surface mining operations.  Coarse fragments are moslty ultra acid shale, medium or coarse grained sandstone, and lesser amounts of fine grained sandstone, siltstone, and coal.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F."

All of the above soils except Barkcamp and Bethesda are less acid and have not formed in mine spoil material.  Dekalb soils have loamy skeletal cambic horizons.  Culleoka, Gilpin, Shelocta, and Westmoreland soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons.  Wellston and Keene siols are fine-silty.  Latham and Wharton soils have fine textured control sections."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped as mine spoils.  Fragments of shale give a positive test for sulfides with sodium azide.  Gypsum crystals, mostly as small rosettes of acicular crystals, are common on surfaces of shale flakes in the partially weathered fragments.  This pedon is in the Duck Creek Reclamation Project where fly ash is mixed in the surface.  The Enoch series has no diagnostic horizons except for the ochric epipedon, 0 to 7 inches (A).  It is assumed to have an Udic moisture regime."
