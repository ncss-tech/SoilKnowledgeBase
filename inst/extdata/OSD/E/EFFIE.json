  "OVERVIEW": "The Effie series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine modified calcareous till on glacial till uplands and moraines. These soils have moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
