Content of rock fragments, of mixed lithology, ranges from 1 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2 or is neutral. It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam. It typically has few to common high chroma Fe concentrations. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B/E horizon has properties similar to the Eg and Btg horizons respectively.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, clay, silty clay loam, or silty clay with clay content ranging from 35 to 60 percent. Sand content ranges from 20 to 45 percent (mainly medium sand or finer). It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bkg horizon with properties similar to the BCg horizon.\nThe BCg or Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent."
