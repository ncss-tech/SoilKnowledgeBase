  "OVERVIEW": "The Euell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolite, rhyodacite, or rhyolitic tuff.  These soils are on mountain slopes, hills, benches and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
