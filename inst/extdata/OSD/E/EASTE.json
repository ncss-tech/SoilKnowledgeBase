  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Easte soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on north-facing footslope and backslope positions.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,830 to 2,320 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 730 mm occurring mostly as snowfall.  The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of January 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Humic Haploxerepts based on laboratory data and properties of associated soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 107 cm (A1, A2, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 107 cm to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw1 horizon and parts of the A2 and Bw2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled for characterization by UC Davis Soil Morphology Laboratory.  Organic carbon content is 8.8 percent in the A1 horizon, 3.7 percent in the A2 horizon, 1 percent in the Bw1 horizon, and 0.8 percent in the Bw2 horizon.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 49 percent in the A1 horizon, 31 percent in the A2 horizon, 49 percent in the Bw1 horizon, and 63 percent in the Bw2 horizon.  Ratios of 1500 kPa water to measured clay ranges from 6.1 in the A1 horizon to 2.0 in the Bw1 horizon.\nUser Pedon ID: 2016NV031800.\nPrevious editors and authors include: SES-SJB-JJJ.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
