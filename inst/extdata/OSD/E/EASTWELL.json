  "OVERVIEW": "The Eastwell series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Eastwell soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
