    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eastwell soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some amount of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
