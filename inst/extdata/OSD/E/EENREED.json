Deecree soils average 31 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section and have 15 to 30 percent rock fragments in the upper part.  Denay soils have 10 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer. Eaglecone soils are dry from Aug 15 to Oct 15, have 20 to 39 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section and rock fragments are dominated by basalt cobbles. Nirac soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Pamison soils have 8 to 15 percent clay in the particle size control section, and have secondary silica accumulation in the calcic horizon.  Rudeen soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 cm.   Wereld soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact and have 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.

Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,920 to 2,380 m. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
