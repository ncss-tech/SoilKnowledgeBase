  "OVERVIEW": "The Eenreed series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and with local admixtures of shale and limestone. Eenreed soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
