  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 60 inches or more. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages between 35 and 60 percent clay and 35 percent or more rock fragments that are dominantly chert.  Reaction of the A horizon and Bt horizon range from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except higher where limed, and the 2Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or loam or their gravelly analogues. Gravel content is 5 to 25 percent, and cobble content is 3 to 15 percent.\nThe BE, BA, or E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture commonly is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, and the lower part 7.5YR to 10R. Value is 3 to 6 and chroma is 3 to 8. Textures are the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, and can be silt loam in the upper part. Gravel content in the Bt horizon is 25 to 60 percent, and cobble content is 3 to 15 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color similar to the Bt horizon. It commonly is clay or gravelly clay, and less commonly silty clay or silty clay loam or their gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues. Gravel content is 0 to 65 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Similar series in other families are the Clareson, Craig, Eldorado and Keeno soils. Clareson, Craig, and Eldorado soils are thermic. In addition, Eldorado soils are loamy-skeletal. Keeno soils have a fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eldon soils are on uplands in prairie areas of the western border Ozarks region. Slopes typically are 2 to 9 percent, but range to as much as 25 percent. These soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone interbedded with shale and sandstone bedrock. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches."
