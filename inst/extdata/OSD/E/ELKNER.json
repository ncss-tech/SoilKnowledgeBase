    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0522, MT1297, MT1277, MT8138. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 9 inches (E1 horizon); a cambic horizon from 22 to 38 inches (E and Bt horizons); a particle-size control section from 12 to 42 inches (part of the E2, E and Bt, and part of the BC horizons).  Elkner soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Lamellic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Lamellic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
