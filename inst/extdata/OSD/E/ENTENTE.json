  "OVERVIEW": "The Entente series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake terraces and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
