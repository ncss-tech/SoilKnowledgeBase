  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Escavada soils are on nearly level alluvial flats and flood plains of intermittent rivers and streams. These soils formed in coarsely stratified recent alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. These soils represent the deposits of abandoned channels which have been buried by the deposits of point bars, natural levees and crevasse splays. Most pedons reflect this with a fining-upward sequence in grain size. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but can range up to 8 percent in isolated areas. Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 6,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 12 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October. These soils receive up to 5 inches of additional moisture from summer flooding and capillary rise above a fluctuating water table. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 120 to 165 days."

Jeddito and Notal soils are on low stream terraces of valley bottoms and are coarse-loamy and fine textured, respectively. Shumbegay soils are on non-flooded, hummocky surfaces of low stream terraces and are sodium affected."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nFluventic feature - An irregular decrease in the percentage of organic carbon with depth and strata of loamy very fine sand and finer in subhorizons between 10 and 40 inches (C3, C4, C5 and C6 horizons).\nSalinity values were determined on four pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.\nMany additional areas of this soil exist along the Chaco River and other washes in southern San Juan County. In other areas this soil has been mapped as Riverwash or as Blancot and Notal soils. Study of aerial photographs from 1934 indicates no vegetation at all on what is now the Escavada soil.\nThe invasion and growth of saltcedar has allowed the flood plains along the Chaco River to become somewhat stable. This partial stabilization by saltcedar has allowed other plant species to colonize these areas.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nUpdate and revisions for the correlation of Little Colorado River Area (AZ707), Sept. 2011, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
