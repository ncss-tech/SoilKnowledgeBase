These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 12 to 16 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 3 to 8 percent clay.  Depth to the densic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has values of 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 3 or 4 dry or moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Enson soils are on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated mountains.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in till from granitic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F; and the average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
