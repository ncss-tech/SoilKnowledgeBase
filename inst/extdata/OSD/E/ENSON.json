  "OVERVIEW": "The Enson series consists of moderately deep to a densic contact, well drained soils formed in till from granitic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
