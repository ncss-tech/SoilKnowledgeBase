  "OVERVIEW": "The Estella series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapid permeable.  These nearly level soils formed in sandy eolian deposits over loamy sediments on the Sandsheet of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was formerly included in the Sarita series.  The series was separated based on the presence of redoximorphic concentrations within the upper 51 cm (20 in), fluctuating water table, and difference in drainage class.  This soil would classify as loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Grossarenic Oxyaquic Haplustalfs if provided for in Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 145 to 196 cm (57 to 77 in). (2Btg horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 in). (A horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 145 cm 203 cm (57 to 80 in). (2Btg horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (A, E and 2Btg horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions: 91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 in). (E2 and 2Btg horizons)\nEndosaturation: 51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in), in most years from November to April\nLithologic discontinuity: 145 to 203 cm (57 to 80 in). Calcium/Magnesium rations showed disruption in the plotted curve; also a change in the ratio of fine sand to very fine sand.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S00TX-261-005 from Kenedy County, Texas."
