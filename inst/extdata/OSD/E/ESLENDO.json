  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eslendo series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. Eslendo soils are on ridges, hills, mesas, and backslopes of escarpments. Slopes are 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Gerst soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Taluce and Tassel soils have less than 18 percent clay. Epping soils contain significant amounts of glass shards. Quarteles soils have significant amounts of mica. Remorris and Redarrow soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder. Picante soils are dry for a shorter period of time before July 15 and are moist for a longer period following the winter solstice. Sandoval soils are moist for shorter periods of time during January through March. In addition, Canyon, Epping, Redarrow, Tassel, Shingle, and Taluce soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June. Simel soils have a lithic contact underlaying the paralithic contact. Tesihim soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle control section."
