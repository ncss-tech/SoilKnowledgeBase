  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkins series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils with slow or very slow permeability.  These soils formed in acid alluvium washed from upland soils that formed in shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

Where unlimed, reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  Some pedons contain small amounts of gravel in individual horizons.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium through coarse subangular blocky or prismatic.  Mottles are few to many and have higher chroma.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C or 2C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The C horizon of some pedons are underlain by organic deposits (peat) below 45 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Elkins series was made inactive on February 15, 1979.  It was proposed for reactivation in Nicholas County, West Virginia in 1985.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are: 1.   Ochric epipedon (umbric intergrade) - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon). 2.  Aquic feature - the zone from 8 to 36 inches has chroma of 2 or less (Bg horizon)."
