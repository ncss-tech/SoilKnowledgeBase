  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Where unlimed, reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  Some pedons contain small amounts of gravel in individual horizons.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium through coarse subangular blocky or prismatic.  Mottles are few to many and have higher chroma.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C or 2C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The C horizon of some pedons are underlain by organic deposits (peat) below 45 inches."

Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 59 degrees F."

Buchanan and Monongahela soils are on terraces and footslopes and have argillic horizons and fragipans. Dekalb, Gilpin, and Lily soils are on uplands and formed in residuum. Purdy and Tygart soils are on terraces and have argillic horizons."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Elkins series was made inactive on February 15, 1979.  It was proposed for reactivation in Nicholas County, West Virginia in 1985.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are: 1.   Ochric epipedon (umbric intergrade) - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon). 2.  Aquic feature - the zone from 8 to 36 inches has chroma of 2 or less (Bg horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
