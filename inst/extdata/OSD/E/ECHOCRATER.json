    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Echocrater soils are on south-facing slopes on cinder cones. Elevation is 5,800 to 7,500 feet. Slopes are 20 to 40 percent. The soils are formed in recent ash and cinders from the Craters of the Moon volcanics. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow. The average annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
