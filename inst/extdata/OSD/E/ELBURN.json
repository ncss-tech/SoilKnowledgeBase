  "OVERVIEW": "The Elburn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
