The poorly drained Drummer soils and the well drained Plano soils form a hydro-sequence with Elburn soils. Drummer soils are on lower positions and Plano soils are on higher positions. The somewhat poorly drained Kendall and Virgil soils form a biosequence with Elburn soils and are on similar parts of the landscape nearby. Kendall soils have an ochric epipedon with moist color value of 4 or 5 and Virgil soils have an ochric epipedon less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick with moist color value of 2 or 3. The poorly drained Thorp soils have an albic horizon and are on nearly level to depressional parts of the landscape nearby."

An apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loess and moderately high to high in the outwash (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second in the loess and 4.23 to 42. 34 micrometers per second in the outwash). Permeability is moderate in the loess and moderate to moderately rapid in the outwash."

These and similar soils that formed in loess/outwash or sandy loam till will be evaluated to determine what needs to be done to keep separate areas of outwash and areas of till. Possibly new series will be developed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 cm (16 inches) (Ap and A horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 41 to 125 cm (16 to 49 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Btg horizons);\nlithological discontinuity - at a depth of 125 cm (49 inches) (contact between the Btg and 2BCtg horizons).\nThe pedon number is 1985IL021002.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
