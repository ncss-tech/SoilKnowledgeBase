  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Everly series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 25 to 90 centimeters of loamy surficial sediments and the underlying till.  These soils are on convex slopes on ground moraines and till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to l8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 690 millimeters.",

It is the nature of this till to have fracture/structural planes in the lower horizons previously considered an unaltered C horizon.  Carbonate coats, iron coats, and redoximorphic features are common on faces of fractures and structural planes.  Past descriptions have referred to vertical cleavage planes in the C horizon.\nDifferentia between Everly series and Ocheyedan series needs further study.\nThese soils are borderline to Oxyaquic subgroup. To resolve this issue, further study may be needed.\nDrainage class is a state interpretation.  In some states, the drainage class is called well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual.\nSome pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data for the type location profile (S59 Iowa 21-8) is available in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 3, Soil Conservation Service, August 1966.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
