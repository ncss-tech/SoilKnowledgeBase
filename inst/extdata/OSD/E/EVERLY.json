It is the nature of this till to have fracture/structural planes in the lower horizons previously considered an unaltered C horizon.  Carbonate coats, iron coats, and redoximorphic features are common on faces of fractures and structural planes.  Past descriptions have referred to vertical cleavage planes in the C horizon.\nDifferentia between Everly series and Ocheyedan series needs further study.\nThese soils are borderline to Oxyaquic subgroup. To resolve this issue, further study may be needed.\nDrainage class is a state interpretation.  In some states, the drainage class is called well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual.\nSome pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data for the type location profile (S59 Iowa 21-8) is available in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 3, Soil Conservation Service, August 1966.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
