    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. The soil is usually moist and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 14 to 25 inches thick.  Andic properties range from 7 to 10 inches. The particle-size control section has less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 0 to 15 percent pararock fragments.  It has an estimated phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, 15-bar moisture of more than 15 percent (air-dried) and a moist bulk density of less than 0.90 g/cc.\nThe AB horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam, medial silt loam, or silty clay loam and has 0 to 30 percent pararock fragments. It has 25 to 30 percent clay by field estimate, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 3.0, and moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.20.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It averages 22 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 60 percent siltstone pararock fragments. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, when present, averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 60 percent siltstone pararock fragments."

In addition, Knappa soils have an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick, and when present, have rounded and subrounded rock and pararock fragments of alluvial origin. Templeton soils are 40 to greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Walluski soils also have redox depletions at a depth of 24 to 40 inches."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from sedimentary bedrock. The climate is cool and wet during the winter. The mean annual precipitation of 60 to 110 inches. Many summer days have fog or low cloud cover during the mornings. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., and average July temperature is 59 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 245 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Ecola soils were included in the Astoria series in old soil survey publications.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nUmbric epipedon - from 3 to 19 inches (A and AB horizons)\nCambic horizon - from 19 to 36 inches (Bw horizon)\nAndic feature - from 3 to 10 inches (A horizon) also meeting andic soil properties. Particle-size control section - from 13 to 43 inches.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nA proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties. If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference sample #S84OR-007-001; NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
