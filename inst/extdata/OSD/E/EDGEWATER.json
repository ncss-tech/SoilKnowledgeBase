  "OVERVIEW": "The Edgewater series consists of deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils that formed in stratified mixed alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to slightly concave portions of alluvial terraces and very gently sloping alluvial fans.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about\n48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 40 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Substratums of sand and gravel occur a depths of 24 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .7 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth in the upper solum but may become erratic in lower horizon.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated.   The upper part of the control section ranges in clay from 18 to 35 percent, in silt from 5 to 30 percent, and in sand from 40 to 75 percent.  Rock fragments, predominantly of gravel size, range from 0 to 15 percent above the contrasting substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Mottling is typically distinct or prominent.  Usually, the horizon has granular to subangular blocky structure in its upper part, and is subangular blocky in the lower portions.  It is soft or slightly hard.  Reaction ranges from pH 6.5 to 7.6.\nThe B2g or Cg horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR and chroma of 2 or less.  Distinct to prominent mottling occurs throughout these horizons.  Structure is subangular blocky or the horizons are massive.  Reaction ranges from pH 6.8 to 8.0, and there is no consistent accumulation of secondary carbonate."

At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches, most of which falls during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 69 degrees F."
