  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Content of rock fragments, commonly limestone, shale, and angular chert, ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A and B horizons and usually increases with increasing depth.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 75 percent in the C horizon.  Few to common black oxide (manganese) concretions or black stains, or both, are in some pedons.  Also,\nsome pedons have a few secondary carbonate concretions in the lower part of the B and C horizons.  The A horizon and upper part of the\nB horizon range from strongly acid through neutral and the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon range from moderately acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The A horizon is loam or silt loam and ranges to silty clay loam in eroded areas.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Hue of 5YR is restricted to the lower part of the Bt horizon.  The lower part of the Bt horizon commonly is mottled.  Low chroma mottles are below 40 inches in some pedons.  The Bt horizon is clay or silty clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is commonly mottled.  The BC is clay or silty clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of\n4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is commonly mottled.  The C horizon is clay loam, clay, or silty clay in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Endcav soils are gently sloping to moderately steep upland soils in the Appalachian Ridges and Valleys.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent with 3 to 10 percent slopes dominant.  Rock outcrops are common in some areas.  These soils formed in material weathered from limestone or, in some areas, limestone and calcareous shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 43 inches.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,400 feet."

Faywood, Lodi, Muse, and Poplimento soils have less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Lodi and Muse soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Frederick, Oaklet, and Swimley soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  Guernsey and Pagebrook soils occur on lower parts of the landscape and are not as well drained.  Opequon soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface."

Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 57 inches (Bt horizon).\nc.  Vertic properties - high shrink-swell from 7 to 57 inches.\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). CEC class and shrink-swell based on NASIS data from Rockingham County, Virginia. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
