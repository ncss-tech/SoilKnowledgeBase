  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 14 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the sandy lacustrine sediments overlying the loamy glacial till or lacustrine sediments is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper sediment has 0 to 5 percent rock fragments, but the lower few inches in some pedons contains as much as 35 percent rock fragments (a lag line).  The glacial till has 2 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The rock fragments are of mixed lithology.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Chroma and value of 3 are only in the upper part.  Mottles are in at least some part of the Bw horizon.  The Bw horizon typically is sand or fine sand but the upper part is loamy sand or loamy fine sand in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The content of organic matter is less than 1 percent in all parts of the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has faint to prominent mottles.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has mottles in all parts.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam glacial till, or silt loam or silty clay loam lacustrine sediments.  These sediments contain less than 50 percent fine sand and coarser particles and less than 35 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 40 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2Bw horizon or 2Bk horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Enstrom soils have plane or slightly convex slopes with slope gradients typically 0 to 3 percent, but ranging from 0 to 12 percent.  They are on glacial lake plains and till-floored glacial lake plains.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of sandy lacustrine sediments over calcareous loamy, glacial till or lacustrine sediments.  The lacustrine sediments are of Glacial Lake Agassiz origin and the till is late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches.   Frost-free days range from 90 to 135.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1350 feet above sea level."

Poorly drained Grygla and Kratka soils are on lower positions in the landscape.  Poppleton soils are sandy throughout."
