Marissa soils have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Normal soils do not have matrix color of chroma 2 or less immediately below the Eg horizon. Thorp soils have more than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Vesser soils have more than 10 percent sand throughout the argillic horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ebbert soils are in depressions on broad loess covered Illinoian till plains. Slopes typically are less than 1 percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in loess. They are underlain at depths of 102 to about 165 cm (40 to about 65 inches) by silty or loamy sediments or drift or a buried Sangamon paleosol formed in loamy sediments or drift or in Illinoian aged till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1143 mm (38 to 45 inches)."

The Illinoian age till typically contains a Sangamon paleosol.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (13 inches) Ap and A horizons).\nAlbic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 56 cm (13 to 22 inches) (Eg horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 56 to 122 cm (22 to 48 inches) (Btg horizon).\nArgiaquic feature: lack an abrupt textural change between the Eg and Btg horizon.\nAquic conditions: redox features present in all horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
