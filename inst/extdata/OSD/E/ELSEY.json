  "OVERVIEW": "The Elsey series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basalt.  Elsey soils are on mounds on tops of basalt plateaus in volcanic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, (889 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
