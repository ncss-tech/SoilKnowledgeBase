  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkberry series consists of very deep, well drained soils on structural benches, ridge summits of mountains, and hills on plateaus.  They formed in silty sediments with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Some pedons have residuum from gneiss and schist in the lower part of the solum.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",
