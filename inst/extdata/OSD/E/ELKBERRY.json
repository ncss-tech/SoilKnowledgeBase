    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elkberry soils are on structural benches, ridge summits in mountains, and hills on plateaus at elevations of 1,800 to 4,600 feet (549 to 1402 meters) with slopes of 5 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in silty sediments with a thick mantel of volcanic ash.  In some pedons the lower part of the solum is in gneiss or schist residuum.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 31 to 55 inches (787 to 1397 mm).  The frost free season is 50 to 120 days."
