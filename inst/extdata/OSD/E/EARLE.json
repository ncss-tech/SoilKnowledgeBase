  "REVDATE": "04/2017",
  "STATES": "AR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Earle series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium.  These soils are on the flood plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the MLRA 131.  Slope is dominantly 0 to 3 percent but ranges to 6 percent on narrow ridges within the flood plain.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Earle soils are on flood plains of the lower Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area.  Slope gradients mainly are less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  Areas not protected by levees are flooded for long to very long periods.  The soil formed in clayey alluvium 20 to 36 inches thick over the underlying loamy alluvium.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches near the type location."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include alligator, Commerce, Mhoon, Forestdale, Sharkey and Tunica series. Alligator and Sharkey soils are in a very-fine particles class.  Commerce and Mhoon soils are fine-silty in the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section.  Forestdale soils are in a fine particle-size class and Tunica soils are in an non-acid reaction class."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; very slow permeability in the clay horizons and moderate in the loamy horizon.  These soils are flooded unless protected by levees, especially during the spring and fall months.  These soils have a perched seasonal water table within 12 inches of the soil surfacee during wet seasons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the Earle soils are used for growing cotton, soybeans, small grains, corn, hay, and pasture.  A small amount is in bottomland hardwoods.  Important commercial trees are cherrybark oak, eastern cottonwood, green ash, Nuttall oak, sweetgum, and American sycamore.  Other trees include elm, water oak, hackberry, pecan, and water hickory."
