  "REVDATE": "12/2006",
  "STATES": "MI,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Evart series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in sandy alluvium on flood plains.  These soils have rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth.  Mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.\nThe particle-size control section has variable textures within short horizontal distances.  The content of fine and coarser sand averages 80 to 100 percent.\nSome pedons have up to 8 inches organic material on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2, moist or dry.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  The clay loam is a thin deposit over sand or loamy sand.  Cobble content is 0 to 3 percent. Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Chroma of 4 is considered to be due to oxygenated water.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, gravelly sand, coarse sand, or gravelly coarse sand with thin finer textured strata in some pedons.  Cobble content is 0 to 3 percent.  Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
