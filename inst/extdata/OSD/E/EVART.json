(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)\nA1--0 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.\nA2--10 to 22 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak coarse granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; few fine distinct brown (10YR 5/3) masses of iron oxide in the matrix; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 11 to 24 inches.)\nCg1--22 to 36 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand; single grain; loose; common fine roots; few fine faint gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions in the matrix; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.\nCg2--36 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth.  Mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.\nThe particle-size control section has variable textures within short horizontal distances.  The content of fine and coarser sand averages 80 to 100 percent.\nSome pedons have up to 8 inches organic material on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2, moist or dry.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  The clay loam is a thin deposit over sand or loamy sand.  Cobble content is 0 to 3 percent. Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Chroma of 4 is considered to be due to oxygenated water.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, gravelly sand, coarse sand, or gravelly coarse sand with thin finer textured strata in some pedons.  Cobble content is 0 to 3 percent.  Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

Grayling soils are excessively drained and have an ochric epipedon.  Rubicon soils are excessively drained and have a spodic horizon.  Kalkaska soils are somewhat excessively drained and have a spodic horizon."

An apparent high water table is 1 foot above the surface to a depth of 2 feet below the surface at any time of the year.  These soils are subject to occasional, brief to long periods of flooding."
