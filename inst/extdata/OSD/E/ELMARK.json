  "OVERVIEW": "The Elmark series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
