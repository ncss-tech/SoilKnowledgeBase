    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature at 20 inches depth is about 73 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe combined thickness of the A and Bw horizon and depth to the calcic horizon is 10 to 30 inches.  Organic matter content averages more than 1 percent to a depth of 15 inches.  Gravel size rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.  Many thin crusted soft shells, ranging from 5 to 10 mm in size are found throughout the profile in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline and slightly to strongly calcareous. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It has weak to moderate fine to coarse subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline and moderately to strongly calcareous.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam and loamy sand with the loamy sands occurring at depths below 40 inches.   It is strongly to very strongly alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 30 to 45 percent with the particle size control section averaging less than 40 percent. It is strongly to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam and loamy sand with the loamy sands occurring at depths below 40 inches.  It is strongly to very strongly alkaline."

Parent material is lacustrine deposits derived from a wide variety of parent rocks, consisting mostly of limestone and sandstone.  The climate is dry subhumid, with a mean annual precipitation of 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 130 days."
