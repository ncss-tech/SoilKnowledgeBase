  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to about 40 inches in thickness.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages between 6 and 18 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue or is neutral, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has thin layers of loamy fine sand less than five inches thick in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Few to common and faint to distinct redoximorphic features are in the lower part of the Bw horizon in many pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam or loamy sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges for 6 to 20 percent and carbonates are disseminated or in masses.  The Bk horizon does not have redox features in some pedons.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon typically has 2.5Y hue, and less commonly 10YR or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or very fine sandy loam, but in some pedons below depths of 40 inches it has coarser or finer textures. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Emrick, Inkster and Swenoda series and the Clontarf series as previously classified.  Clontarf soils have fine sand or coarser textures within the particle-size control section.  Emrick soils have a loam series control section, formed in glacial till and have coarse fragments throughout.  Inkster soils have more than 50 percent shale in the sand size fraction of the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section.  Swenoda soils have silt loam or loam 2C horizons at depths of 22 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The level to moderately sloping Embden soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, deltas and terraces.  Slope gradients commonly are less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  The soil formed in glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 36 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Arveson soils are in nearby swales.  They have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches and are poorly drained.  Egeland, Tiffany and Wyndmere soils are in a drainage sequence with Embden soils.  Egeland soils are on the convex well drained higher parts of the landscape.  They have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches in thickness. Tiffany and Wyndmere soils are in swales and depressions.  Tiffany soils are poorly drained and contain mottles in the lower part of the A horizon.  Wyndmere soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches."

A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time during the period April through June in the moderately well drained phase.  It is at a depth of 4 to more than 6 feet for the same period in the well drained phase."
