Depth to free carbonates ranges from 7 to 10 inches but are at or near the surface in some pedons. Depth to varved material is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is silt loam or loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand and less than 18 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cyz horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam varved with very thin strata of very fine sand to clay in the lower part.  It has few ot many nests of salt and gypsum. It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Edwin soils formed on shoulders in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments of silt sized particles but with varves of very fine sand to clay sized particles.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 150 days; average growing precipitation is 13 to 15 inches; and growing degree days are about 2800 to 3200."
