  "OVERVIEW": "The Eoyote series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Eoyote soils are on terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
