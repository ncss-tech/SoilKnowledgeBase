The Raton soils have formed in materials derived from basalt and have influence from ash, cinders, and other volcanic materials.  They have a neutral reaction throughout the profile and have 15 to 20 inches of precipitation.  The Sinnigam soils do not have a Bk horizon and are extremely stony in the Bt2 horizon."
