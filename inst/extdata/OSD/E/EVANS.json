The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The soil has an irregular decrease in organic carbon and has over 0.3 percent organic carbon to a depth of 50 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay and has texture of loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It has 12 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel."

Coxlake soils are somewhat poorly drained with mottles of chroma 2 or less above 30 inches.  Endersby soils are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Leavenworth soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the C horizon and have strata of loamy fine sand in the control section.  Narcisse soils are mottled at 20 to 40 inches and are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  Okanogan soils are neutral to moderately alkaline throughout or in some part of the particle-size control section.  Patit Creek soils are very gravelly in the lower part of the control section.  Pleasant View and Redola soils are calcareous throughout or in some part of the particle-size control section.  Poween soils are moderately or strongly alkaline throughout."

The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters.  The mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; the mean January temperature is 37 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 235 days.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 18 to 60 inches.  In the interior river valleys of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation ranges to 90 inches."

Central Point soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon content with increasing depth, and occur on low stream terraces and alluvial fans."
