    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the clayey material ranges from 12 to 32 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2. The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction of the A and E horizons is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nWhere there is no Bhs horizon, the Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4. Where there is a Bhs horizon, it has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand. Reaction of the Bhs horizon is moderately acid.  The Bs horizon is moderately acid or slightly acid, but is always moderately acid in pedons that do not have a Bhs horizon.\nSome pedons have E' horizons. Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand. The loamy upper part of the soil averages from 4 to 12 percent clay and 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe B part of the 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It has textures similar to those of the 2Bt horizon.  The E part of the 2B/E has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Reaction of the 2B/E horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to 70 percent. Reaction of the Bt horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay or clay. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The soil has a seasonal high water table that is perched at the contact between the loamy and clayey material and ranges from .5 to 1.5 feet below the surface at some time during the period from November to May. Runoff is slow. Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy part and very slow in the lower clayey part."
