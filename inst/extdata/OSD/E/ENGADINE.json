  "OVERVIEW": "The Engadine series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy lacustrine deposits and in the underlying clayey lacustrine sediments on lake plains. Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy part and very slow in the clayey material.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction of the A and E horizons is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nWhere there is no Bhs horizon, the Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4.

Reaction of the Bhs horizon is moderately acid.  The Bs horizon is moderately acid or slightly acid, but is always moderately acid in pedons that do not have a Bhs horizon.\nSome pedons have E' horizons. Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand. The loamy upper part of the soil averages from 4 to 12 percent clay and 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe B part of the 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It has textures similar to those of the 2Bt horizon.  The E part of the 2B/E has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Reaction of the 2B/E horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.
