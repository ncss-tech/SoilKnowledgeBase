  "OVERVIEW": "The Emmert series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and sandy-skeletal glacial outwash on eskers, kames, terraces, and moraines. These soils have rapid or very rapid permeability. Their slopes range from 1 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The particle size control section has 35 to 90  percent by volume, of rock fragments commonly dispersed throughout the matrix, but in some pedons the fragments are in distinct strata. They are mostly of igneous origin and commonly 0.5 to 10 cm in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sand or coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR hue; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 6. They are coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues. They are neutral to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sand or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction and stratification is common. It is neutral to strongly acid."

These soils formed in noncalcareous, sandy and sandy-skeletal outwash of Late Wisconsinan Age. The mean annual air temperature is approximately 35 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 34 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 140 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."
