  "OVERVIEW": "The Edenbower series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from semiconsolidated basalt.  Edenbower soils are on ridgetops and hill slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The depth to a lithic contact is 4 to 10 inches.  The profile has cracks that are open for 60 to 90 days during the summer.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay, averaging 45 to 60 percent clay."

The soils formed in fine textured residuum or colluvium weathered predominantly from basic igneous materials.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Nonpareil soils are loamy and are 10 to 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact."
