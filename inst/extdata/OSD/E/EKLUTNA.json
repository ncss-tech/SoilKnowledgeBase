  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eklutna series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in a gravelly alluvium. Eklutna soils are on terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Total content of coarse fragments in the control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent; 35 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. The soil moisture control section is affected by peak precipitation that occurs from July through October, and is relatively even throughout the rest of the year.\nThe O horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.\nAn A horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe C horizon, has value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 4. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

The Alflack soils have hard bedrock between 20 to 40 inches.  Canlodore and Perfecto soils have albic horizons.  Castlepeak soils have hues redder than 2.5Y.  Chena soils have a high mica content. Cryomont soils have greater than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth-fraction. Graylock soils have hard bedrock between 40 to 60 inches. Nataga soil moisture control section is affected by peak precipitation that occurs from September through February. Nizina soils have C horizons that are slightly to mildly alkaline. Obscurity and Studebaker soils have volcanic ash in the control section. Ragamuffin soils have soft bedrock between 20 to 40 inches. Sofgran soils have cambic horizons. Stecum soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface."
