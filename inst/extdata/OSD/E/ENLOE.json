It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  In some pedons, the E horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  The thickness of the E horizon ranges widely within a short distance, and the lower boundary is abrupt or clear and wavy, irregular or broken.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically averages between 55 and 60 percent clay and ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  It has weak or moderate very coarse to medium prismatic structure which parts to strong medium to very fine blocky.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is massive, laminated or blocky silty clay or clay.  It is mottled in many pedons.  It contains 6 to 20 percent calcium carbonate.  Some pedons have a Cg horizon.  Some pedons contain clay loam or clay till below depths of about 40 inches."
