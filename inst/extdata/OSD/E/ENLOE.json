  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and the depth to the E horizon ranges from 7 to 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 1 to 3 and 3 or 4 dry; and chroma of 1.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay. It has abrupt or clear, smooth or wavy lower boundary.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry; and chroma of 1.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  In some pedons, the E horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  The thickness of the E horizon ranges widely within a short distance, and the lower boundary is abrupt or clear and wavy, irregular or broken.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically averages between 55 and 60 percent clay and ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  It has weak or moderate very coarse to medium prismatic structure which parts to strong medium to very fine blocky.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is massive, laminated or blocky silty clay or clay.  It is mottled in many pedons.  It contains 6 to 20 percent calcium carbonate.  Some pedons have a Cg horizon.  Some pedons contain clay loam or clay till below depths of about 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Enloe soils are in shallow basins and swales in level lake plains.  The soils formed in silty clay and clay glaciolacustrine sediments.  The climate is cool subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 17 to 22 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Aberdeen soils have a natric horizon and are not as wet.  Dovray soils do not have E horizons and have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Fargo soils do not have E horizons.  Galchutt soils have A and E horizons that contain less than 35 percent clay.  Fargo and Hegne soils are on the higher parts of the lake plain.  Hegne soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches.  Ryan soils have a thin A horizon and a natric horizon."
