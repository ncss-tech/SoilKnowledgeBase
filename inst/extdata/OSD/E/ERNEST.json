It also revises the format, updates the competing and geographically associated soils, adds saturated hydraulic conductivity class, and adds somewhat poorly drained to the agricultural drainage class.\nBased on a review of 31 typifying pedon (TP) descriptionsthroughout MO-13, 23 descriptions (74%) had a depth to low chroma redox features of 17 inches or less, while 8 (26%) had a depth of 18 inches or more. Mean depth was 16.7 inches. These data support a somewhat poorly drained (SPD) class as well as amoderately well drained (MWD) class. Given the relatively narrow depths for MWD soils within the Aquic Fragiudults taxonomic subgroup, these landforms generally have SPD and MWD soils intermingled. Additionally, dual drainage classes have been maintained in other soil series such as Buchanan and Calverton, which have the same taxonomic subgroup.\nPrevious revisions: AWD-WRK-ART 05/1999"
