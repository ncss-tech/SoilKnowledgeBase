  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -- the zone from 0 to 28 cm (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon -- the zone from 28 to 160 cm (Bt and Btx horizons)\nFragipan -- the zone from 76 to 160 cm\nAquic conditions -- the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 25 cm of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year if precipitation is within normal ranges.\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section -- the zone from 0 to 160 cm\nThe 09/2008 revision moves the Type Location and Typical Pedon for the series from Fayette County, West Virginia to Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. It also revises the format, updates the competing and geographically associated soils, adds saturated hydraulic conductivity class, and adds somewhat poorly drained to the agricultural drainage class.\nBased on a review of 31 typifying pedon (TP) descriptionsthroughout MO-13, 23 descriptions (74%) had a depth to low chroma redox features of 17 inches or less, while 8 (26%) had a depth of 18 inches or more. Mean depth was 16.7 inches. These data support a somewhat poorly drained (SPD) class as well as amoderately well drained (MWD) class. Given the relatively narrow depths for MWD soils within the Aquic Fragiudults taxonomic subgroup, these landforms generally have SPD and MWD soils intermingled. Additionally, dual drainage classes have been maintained in other soil series such as Buchanan and Calverton, which have the same taxonomic subgroup.\nPrevious revisions: AWD-WRK-ART 05/1999\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
