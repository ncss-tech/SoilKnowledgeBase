  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Thickness of the solum is 20 to 40 inches. The upper 14 to 20 inches of the solum is estimated to have andic soil properties. The particle-size control section has by weighted average 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid. Pedons in uncultivated areas have an A horizon 3 to 7 inches thick that is similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is ashy loam or ashy sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in the matrix, 5YR or 7.5YR in the ortstein or redox accumulations; value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry in the matrix and 4 through 6 in the ortstein or redox accumulations. It is loamy sand or sand. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid. The lower part contains 50 to 90 percent ortstein as rounded or angular concretions, slag-like fragments or as irregularly shaped indurated concretions.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is coarse sand or medium sand. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edmonds soils are on outwash terraces and outwash plains at elevations of 50 to 300 feet. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over glacial outwash. Edmonds soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Snow cover is intermittent. The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May. Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall. The mean January temperature is 36 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the  Everson, Fishtrap, Hale, Indianola, Laxton, Lynden, Pangborn, Tromp, and Woodlyn soils. Everson soils are clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Fishtrap and Pangborn soils are Histosols. Hale soils lack an aquic moisture regime and are 0 to 15 percent ortstein fragments in the control section. Indianola soils have a xeric moisture regime and are sandy. Laxton, Lynden and Tromp soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Woodlyn soils are 10 to 14 inches to a continuously strongly cemented ortsein pan."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are drained and used mainly for cropland. Hay, pasture, and corn silage are common crops. Native vegetation is red alder, western hemlock, western redcedar, bigleaf maple, paper birch, and black cottonwood with an understory of vine maple, salmonberry, red huckleberry, western swordfern, and salal."
