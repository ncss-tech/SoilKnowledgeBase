  "OVERVIEW": "The Emeline series consists of very shallow or shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 10 to 25 centimeters of loamy material overlying limestone bedrock. These soils are on interfluves, nose slopes and side slopes on dissected, bedrock-controlled uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
