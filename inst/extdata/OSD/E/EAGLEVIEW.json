  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eagleview series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in glacial outwash on outwash plains, valley trains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

The volume of rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the series control section. The particle-size control section averages more than 40 percent fine sand and coarser. The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 (value of 6 or more when dry) and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand. It is moderately acid to neutral. When not tilled, the A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3, and ranges in thickness from 1 to 4 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand or coarse sand. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sand or coarse sand. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.

This soil was separated from Graycalm due to climate and being more productive soil for mixed deciduous tree species."
