  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Free carbonates are typically at depths of 25 to 50 inches but are below 60 inches in some pedons. The volume of rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the series control section. The particle-size control section averages more than 40 percent fine sand and coarser. The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 (value of 6 or more when dry) and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand. It is moderately acid to neutral. When not tilled, the A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3, and ranges in thickness from 1 to 4 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand or coarse sand. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sand or coarse sand. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam. The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sand or coarse sand. It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eagleview soils have plane or convex slopes on outwash plains, valley trains and moraines. They formed in glacial outwash of Late Wisconsin Age. Slope gradients range from 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 25 inches. Frost free days range from 90 to 130. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1900 feet."

This soil was separated from Graycalm due to climate and being more productive soil for mixed deciduous tree species.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record number MN0705.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
