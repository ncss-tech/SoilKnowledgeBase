    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elaero soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.   Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,150 to 2,600 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
