  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are typically noncalcareous to a depth of 60 or more inches but are calcareous below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  The control section ranges form slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Depth to uniformly skeletal material ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 50 to 52 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are predominantly 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter.  The control section averages coarse sand or loamy coarse sand, and contains a high proportion of angular sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is typically loamy coarse sand but includes coarse sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR."

They formed in noncalcareous, stratified sandy alluvium derived from arkose beds or granite.  Elevations are from 5,200 to 7,400 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 to 17 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 115 to 150 days."
