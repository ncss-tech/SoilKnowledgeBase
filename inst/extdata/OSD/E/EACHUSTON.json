  "STATES": "CO,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eachuston series consists of very deep, poor to very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains and low terrace. They formed in very gravelly, coarse textured alluvial sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm.",
