The A1 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5 YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 and has common medium distinct to many large prominent mottles.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  This horizon typically has granular structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  The C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR and has common medium distinct to many large prominent mottles.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."
