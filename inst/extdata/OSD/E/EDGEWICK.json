The umbric epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, and value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 through 4 dry.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Edgewick soils are on alluvial terraces at elevations of 50 to 500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in alluvium.  Edgewick soils are in a marine climate with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 38 F, mean July temperature is 63 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."
