  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 100 inches.   Exchangeable sodium ranges form 15 to 35 percent within 17 to 40 inches of the upper boundary of the B horizon.  Tongues of the E horizon extend in to the B horizon.  Reaction, except for those surface layers that have been limed, ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid in the A horizon and upper B horizon and from neutral to strongly alkaline in the lower B horizon.  The effective cation exchange capacity typically ranges from 15 to 50 percent, saturated with exchangeable aluminum within 30 inches of the soil surface.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from few to many.  Fine and medium black, brown, or red concretions range from none to common. Tongues of E material extend between prisms in the upper part of the B horizon (B/E horizon).\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from none to many throughout the B horizon.  Mottles with chroma of 1 or 2 range from few to many in the upper 10 inches.  Texture in the upper part of the B horizon is silt loam, or silty clay loam with 3 to 15 percent sand.  The lower part is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Fine or medium black, brown, or red concretions range from few to common throughout."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fred and Tillou series in the same family and the Alazan, Bude, Calloway, Deerford, Metcalf, Poolville, Tippo, and Verdun series in similar families.  Fred soils have alkaline B horizons.  Tillou soils have a Bt horizon above the B/E horizon.  Alazan soils have fine-loamy control sections and siliceous mineralogy.  Bude and Calloway soils have fragipans.  Deerford and Verdun soils have natric horizons.  Metcalf soils have clayey IIB horizons.  Poolville soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Tippo soils have coarse-silty control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Egypt soils are on level to gently undulating stream terraces of late Pleistocene age.  The soil formed in mixed loess and loamy late Pleistocene age stream terrace sediments.  Slope gradients are typicaly less than 1 percent, but range up to 5 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 55 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 60 to 70 degrees F."

Dexter, Gigger and Necessity soils are on higher lying areas and have browner colors.  Gigger soils also have fragipans.  Gilbert soils are poorly drained and have 1 or 2 chroma B horizons.  Foley soils are in the lower depressions and have natric horizons."
