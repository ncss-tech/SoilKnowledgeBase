  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise indicated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to the argillic horizon in till range from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 45 to 80 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the sandy mantle and from 3 to 20 percent in the loamy till.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches and redox depletions are in the upper part of the till in many pedons.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 1 or 2.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.  The E horizon is present in 50 percent or more of uncultivated pedons.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has value and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.  The argillic horizon averages less than 18 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs."

These soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1950 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Near the type location, these are the Fairchild, Fallcreek, Flambeau, Humbird and Ludington soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Fairchild soils and the moderately well drained Ludington soils form a drainage sequence nearby where the till is absent and the soil is moderately deep to interbedded sandstone and shale.  The somewhat poorly drained Fallcreek soils and the moderately well drained Flambeau soils form a drainage sequence on nearby ground moraines where the sandy mantle is absent and the till has more clay and less sand. The moderately well drained Humbird soil is nearby where the sandy mantle and the till are absent and the soil is moderately deep to interbedded sandstone and shale."
