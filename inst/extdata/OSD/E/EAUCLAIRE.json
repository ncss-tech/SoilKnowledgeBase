  "OVERVIEW": "The Eauclaire series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy alluvium and the underlying loamy till on remnants of moraines on summits and shoulders of dissected sandstone uplands. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the loamy till.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise indicated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to the argillic horizon in till range from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 45 to 80 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the sandy mantle and from 3 to 20 percent in the loamy till.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches and redox depletions are in the upper part of the till in many pedons.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 1 or 2.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.  The E horizon is present in 50 percent or more of uncultivated pedons.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has value and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.
