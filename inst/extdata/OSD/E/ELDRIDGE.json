  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to the stratified deposits range from 16 to 35 inches. Depth to bedrock, skeletal, or coarse textured layers is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Some pedons have an A horizon 2 to 4 inches thick.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 1 to 3 inches thick. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand. In some pedons, subhorizons of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam, less than 5 inches thick, are immediately above the 2C horizon. Also, in some pedons the upper part of the Bw horizon, within 10 inches of the mineral soil surface, is fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is stratified very fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay, or clay. The weighted average of the clay content in the 2C horizon is less than 18 percent. Lenses of sand, fine sand, loamy very fine sand, and very fine sand are common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eldridge soils are nearly level to steep soils on glacial lake plains, terraces, or glacial outwash areas. They are on upland plains, terraces, and the tops and side slopes of hills and ridges, and on the side slopes of knolls and swells. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent but typically is  less than 5 percent. The soils formed in thin, sandy glaciofluvial or aeolian deposits underlain by loamy estaurine or glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 55 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F. The frost free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belgrade, Deerfield, Enosburg, Hinesburg, Munson, Suffield and Windsor soils. The well drained Hinesburg and poorly drained Enosburg soils are in a drainage sequence with Eldridge soils.\nBelgrade, Munson and Suffield soils formed in nearby glaciolacustrine or marine sediments and have finer textured sola.  Deerfield and Windsor soils formed in nearby glaciofluvial deposits that are sandy throughout."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1).The typical pedon is not the same pedon published in the Soil Survey of Chittenden County, Vermont.  2). The depleted subhorizon in the C horizon is cited as evidence of depletions. A question has been raised with NSSC regarding the requirement of depletions and not redoximorphic features within the 100 cm. 3). The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Aquic Udorthents feature - depletions within 100 cm of the mineral surface and aquic conditions for some time in most years. (Depleted matrix in subhorizons of the C horizon.)\nc.  Strongly contrasting particle size class - the transition between the sandy material and the loamy material in the control section (to 40 inches) is less than 5 inches. The loamy material has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
