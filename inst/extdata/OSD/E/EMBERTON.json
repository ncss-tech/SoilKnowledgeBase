  "OVERVIEW": "The Emberton series consists of soils that are somewhat excessively drained and moderately deep to bedrock, that formed in wind modified alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
