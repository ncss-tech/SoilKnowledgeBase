Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, and mean annual temperatures range from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 2,700 to 3,500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are less than 25."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils would classify as loamy, siliceous, thermic Grossarenic Ustalfic Haplargids if the Grossarenic subgroup were provided for in SOIL TAXONOMY.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 62 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 62 to 80 inches (Bt horizons)\nIn October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  No update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNSSL: Characterization data available from the type location (S91TX-495-039)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
