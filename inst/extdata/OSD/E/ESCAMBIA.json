  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Depth to horizons with more than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite ranges from 11 to 42 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.  Iron concretions range from none to 5 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow brown, red, and gray range from none to common.  Textures are the same as the A or Ap horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray range from few to common.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Btv horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6; or there is no dominant color and is variegated in shades of gray, brown, red, and yellow.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, red, brown, or gray range from common to many.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has less than 18 percent clay and more than 20 percent silt.  Plinthite ranges from 5 to about 25 percent, by volume. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam. Some pedons are clay loam in the lower part.\nThe Btvg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, red, and brown range from common to many.  Plinthite ranges from 5 to about 25 percent, by volume.\nTexture is the same as the Btv horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Btv horizon. Texture is silty clay, clay loam or clay.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Btvg horizon and the same range of textures as the C horizon."
