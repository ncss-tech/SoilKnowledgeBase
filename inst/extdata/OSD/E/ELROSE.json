The Attoyac and Caledonia soils do not have a clayey lower Bt horizon and in addition Caledonia soils have 30 percent or more silt in the upper Bt horizon. Darbonne soils have 15 to 60 percent ironstone fragments in some subhorizon of the argillic horizon and have a B/C horizon with 30 to 50 percent soft sandstone. Petal soils have brown lower Bt horizons and do not have weathered glauconitic materials. Sallisaw soils have very gravelly lower B horizons. Kamie and Vesey soils have mixed mineralogy. Larue soils have arenic epipedons. Redsprings and Trawick soils have clayey Bt horizons. Ruston and Whakana soils have 5 percent or more albic materials in the lower Bt horizon. Woden soils have coarse-loamy control sections."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elrose soils occur on gently sloping to strongly sloping uplands in the western part of the Southern Coastal Plain. Slope gradients range from 1 to 12 percent but are dominantly less than 6 percent. The soils developed in stratified sediments of marine origin that contain a high content of glauconite mainly from the Weches Geologic Formation. Average annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 270. Elevation ranges from 350 to 750 feet above sea level. The annual average rainfall ranges from 39 to 48 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E index is about 68."
