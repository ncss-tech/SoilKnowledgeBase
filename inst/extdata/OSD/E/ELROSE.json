    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Attoyac, Caledonia, Darbonne, Petal and Sallisaw series in the same family and the Kamie, Larue, Redsprings, Ruston, Trawick, Vesey, Whakana, and Woden soils in similar families. The Attoyac and Caledonia soils do not have a clayey lower Bt horizon and in addition Caledonia soils have 30 percent or more silt in the upper Bt horizon. Darbonne soils have 15 to 60 percent ironstone fragments in some subhorizon of the argillic horizon and have a B/C horizon with 30 to 50 percent soft sandstone. Petal soils have brown lower Bt horizons and do not have weathered glauconitic materials. Sallisaw soils have very gravelly lower B horizons. Kamie and Vesey soils have mixed mineralogy. Larue soils have arenic epipedons. Redsprings and Trawick soils have clayey Bt horizons. Ruston and Whakana soils have 5 percent or more albic materials in the lower Bt horizon. Woden soils have coarse-loamy control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elrose soils occur on gently sloping to strongly sloping uplands in the western part of the Southern Coastal Plain. Slope gradients range from 1 to 12 percent but are dominantly less than 6 percent. The soils developed in stratified sediments of marine origin that contain a high content of glauconite mainly from the Weches Geologic Formation. Average annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 270. Elevation ranges from 350 to 750 feet above sea level. The annual average rainfall ranges from 39 to 48 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E index is about 68."

Bub, Cuthbert, Kirvin, and Nacogdoches have clayey control sections. Alto soils have brownish horizons and are in lower wetter positions.

    "content": "REMARKS: The Elrose series was formerly included in the Magnolia series.  The series was updated in 2004 to specify that the iron concentrations are relic, and to allw them to range to many in the lower parts of the Bt horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 inches (the A1 & A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 13 to 80 inches (the Bt1 through the Bt5 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU Lab No. S84TX203-001; THD Lab Nos.
