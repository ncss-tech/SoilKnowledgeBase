  "OVERVIEW": "The Edds series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial drift on plains and mountain slopes at elevations of 3,500 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 29 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The upper part of the 10- to 40-inch control section contains more than 30 percent glassy pyroclastic materials and 0 to 20 percent coarse fragments.  The lower part of the control section contains 5 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand by weighted average; and contains 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments by volume.  The soils are moderately acid to slightly acid.  The mollic or umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  They have weak to moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is heavy ashy loam or ashy clay loam.\nThe C horizons are layered silt loam, loam, sandy loam, and loamy coarse sand that is gravelly in most pedons.  The lower C horizon has some clay films or clay bridging sand grains in some pedons."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 12 inches and a cambic horizon from 12 to 24 inches.  The lower elevations mapped as Edds appear to be frigid and the higher elevations cryic.  The series needs further study.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
