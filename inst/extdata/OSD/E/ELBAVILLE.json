  "OVERVIEW": "The Elbaville series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in a mantle of loess and in underlying loamy-skeletal sediments from fragmented limestone or dolostone on shoulders, side slopes, and foot slopes of dissected uplands.  Permeability is moderately slow or moderate in the mantle of loess and slow to moderate in the subsoil and moderate to rapid in the substratum.  Their slopes range from 12 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Thickness of loess or loamy mantle is 15 to 30 inches.  Coarse fragments typically are lacking in the upper part of the solum and they comprise 0 to 20 percent of the 2B horizon and 35 to 80 percent of the 3B and 3C horizons.  They range from pebble through flagstone and cobblestone in size and are mostly limestone or dolomite.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 with the 3 chroma primarily being in pedons with south- to west-facing slopes.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam and ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  An EB or BE horizon is in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon in the upper sediment has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is a silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  It has common or many faint to prominent clay films on faces of peds.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline and has free carbonates in some pedons.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cazenovia, Conesus, Hilton, Honeoye, Lansing, Lima, Ontario, Wampsville, and Wassaic series in the same family and closely related Collamer and Dunkirk series.  All of the other soils except Wassaic formed in glacial till or lacustrine sediments and do not have either the loess or loamy mantle or the loamy-skeletal material or both.  The Wassaic soils have bedrock beginning within depths of 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Elbaville soils have concave through convex slopes with gradient of 12 to 45 percent slopes on upper back slopes, shoulders, and foot slopes in dissected uplands.  Slopes are 50 to 600 feet in length.  Slope aspect is mostly northwest to northeast in most broad valleys and includes southwest to southeast aspects in narrow ravines.  Relative relief is l00 to 600 feet.  They formed in a 15- to 30-inch mantle of loess or loamy sediments and in loamy-skeletal material from fragmented limestone or dolostone.  In places this overlies sandy-skeletal material from fragmented limestone.  Limestone or sandstone bedrock underlies this material at depths ranging from 60 to 120 inches or more.  Mean annual precipitation is 27 to 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is 45 to 5l degrees F."

They have a mollic epipedon and lack an argillic horizon.  Frontenac soils have a mollic epipedon and are mostly on foot slopes.  LaCrescent soils have a mollic epipedon but have similar landscape position.  Seaton soils are typically on summits and formed entirely in loess.  All of these associated soils are freely drained."
