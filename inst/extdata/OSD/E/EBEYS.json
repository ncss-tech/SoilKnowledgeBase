  "OVERVIEW": "The Ebeys series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in eolian and glacial drift sands.  Ebeys soils are on remnant dunes and on glacial drift plains at elevations of 0 to 80 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm.  The mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
