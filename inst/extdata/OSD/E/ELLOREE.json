  "OVERVIEW": "The Elloree series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments.  These soils have sandy A and E horizons, and loamy Bt horizons.  They are on flood plains of streams in the Coastal plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
