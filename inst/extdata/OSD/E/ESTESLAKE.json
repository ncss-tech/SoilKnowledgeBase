  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Esteslake soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and dissected lake plains.  Elevations are 2,600 to 3,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in varved clayey glaciolacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls in winter and spring.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 120 days."
