  "OVERVIEW": "The Esteslake series consists of very deep, well drained, sodium-affected soils that formed in varved clayey glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on dissected lake plains, stream terraces, and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
