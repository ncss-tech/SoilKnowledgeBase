These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The particle-size control section is mainly silt loam with thin subhorizons of loam and very fine sandy loam in the 2Bk horizon.  The control section has 5 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 4 to 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The Bw2 horizon is absent in some pedons.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is mainly stratified silt loam, but has thin, less than 1 inch, strata of loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam and loam, but contains thin strata of sandy loam below 40 inches in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline, and contains lime.  The 2Bk horizon is absent in some pedons."

These soils all lack unconformable thinly laminated lacustrine material within the particle-size control section.  Kahlotus soils are weakly stratified and have no evidence of secondary lime above 44 inches in depth.  Mikkalo soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Neeley soils have a calcic horizon at a depth of 11 to 20 inches.  Ritzville soils are not stratified."
