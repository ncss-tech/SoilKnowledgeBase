  "OVERVIEW": "The Estacion series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  The formed in moderately fine textured sediments over gravel of mixed origin.  These nearly level soils are on terraces and in floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 70 inches and mean annual temperature is 78 degress F.",
