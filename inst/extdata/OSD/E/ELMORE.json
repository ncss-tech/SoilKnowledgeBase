  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elmore soils are on foothills and mountains and have gradients of 5 to 60 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolite or similar bedrock. Elevations are 3,000 to 5,400 feet. The climate has warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches. The mean summer temperature is 65 degrees to 75 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees to 51 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 100 to 150 days."

DeMasters soils have mean annual temperatures less than 47 degrees F. Rainey soils lack an argillic horizon. Van Dusen soils formed from granitic sand or related acid igneous material and are more than 60 inches deep."
