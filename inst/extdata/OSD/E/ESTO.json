Content of ironstone and quartz gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture range is the same as the A horizon.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  In most pedons the Bt2 horizon is mottled with shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red. In some pedons, there is no dominant matrix color and the horizon is mottled in shades of the above colors.The lower part of the Bt horizon has the same hue, value, and chroma as the upper part or is distinctly to prominently mottled in shades of gray, red, brown, and yellow. Texture of the Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay."

The Faceville series have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or redder and do not have mottles in the upper part.  The Dewey, Summerton, and Waynesboro soils do not have mottles in the upper part of the Bt horizons.  Fullerton and Henderson soils have 15 to 35 percent chert fragments throughout their sola.  Gritney and Maubila soils have mixed mineralogy.  Marlboro soils have few or no mottles in the upper part of the Bt horizon."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  A previous revision (1/72) changed the type location from Florida to Alabama.  Drainage classification has been a problem with this series.  Low chroma mottles appear to have been inherited from the parent material and are not thought to be due to wetness.\nThis revision (6/89) changes the classification from Typic Paleudults to Typic Kandiudults in recognition of the low activity clay of the kandic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (A and E horizons).\nKandic horizon - the zone from approximately 8 to 62 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
