  "OVERVIEW": "The Ellabelle series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils of Coastal Plain depressions and drains.  These soils have black loamy sand A horizons over thick gray sandy clay loam Bt horizons.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 49 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 70 to 96 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in all horizons, except where the soil has been limes.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with a value of 2.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or sand.  It has a minimum thickness of 10 inches where the E horizon is present.\nThe horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4, 5, 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has the same texture as the A horizon.\nThe Btg1 and Btg2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4, 5, 6, or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Few to common mottles are brownish, yellowish, and grayish.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon has 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 20 percent silt.  The lower Bt horizon has same colors as above horizons or it is mottled brownish, yellowish and grayish.  It is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe C horizon has colors and textures like the lower Bt horizon."

Bayboro, Byars, and Cape Fear soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Hyde, Pantego and Paxville soils lack sandy epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Kanapaha and Plummer soils are grossarenic.  Kanapaha soils have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F.  Kiawah and Wadmalaw soils have Bt horizons with base saturation of more than 35 percent.  Portsmouth soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Pelham and Riceboro soils have an ochric epipedon.  Surrency soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the control section."
