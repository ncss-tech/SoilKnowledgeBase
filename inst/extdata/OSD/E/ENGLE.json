  "OVERVIEW": "The Engle series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  These gently sloping to sloping soils formed from weakly cemented calcareous sandstone interbedded with loamy material.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches which corresponds to a paralithic contact consisting of weakly or strongly cemented calcareous sandstone layers that are interbedded with loamy material.  The average clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Fragments of weakly cemented sandstone ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the Bk ranges from 15 to 40 percent.\nThe Cr horizon ranges from weakly cemented to strongly cemented sandstone that is interbedded with loamy materials.  It can be cut with spade or auger.  Roots penetrate only in occasional fractures or in loamy interbedded material."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clark series and the similar Brenham, Carbengle, Lewisville, Sunev, Velow and Venus series.  Clark and Venus soils lack Cr horizons of weakly consolidated sandstone within 40 inches.  Brenham and Lewisville soils are fine-silty.  Carbengle and Sunev soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Velow soils are noncalcareous in the upper part of the solum."

These soils formed in calcareous loamy material containing thin strata of calcareous sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 63 to 70 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches; Frost free days range from 220to 260 days and elevation ranges from 400 to 750 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 44 to 64."
