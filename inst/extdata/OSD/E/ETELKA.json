  "OVERVIEW": "The Etelka series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in unconsolidated silty clay materials of old sedimentary rocks. They are on foot slopes, ridgetops, and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 7 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The amount of hard and partially weathered rock fragments in the control section ranges from 2 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.   Solum thickness is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam with 20 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel.  There is evidence of fire in charcoal flecks or burnt peds as shot in some pedons.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam with 25 to 40 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.  Distinct to prominent redox concentrations are at a depth of 24 to 40 inches.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  .  It is silty clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Etelka soils are on foot slopes, ridgetops, and side slopes of mountains.  Elevations are 50 to 2500 feet.  Slopes are 7 to 70 percent.  The soils have formed in fine and moderately fine textured colluvium, and residuum weathered from highly fractured and intensely sheared sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of Jurassic Age (mostly the Otter Point Formation).  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean January temperature is 43 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 60 to 90 inches.  In the interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation ranges to 130 inches.  The frost-free season is 120 to 240 days."

All of these soils occur on ridgetops, foot slopes, or side slopes of mountains.  Digger soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Bohannon, Preacher, and Rinearson soils have an umbric epipedon.  Also, Bohannon soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Orford soils have an argillic horizon.  Remote soils are loamy-skeletal.  Whobrey soils are fine-silty over clayey and are somewhat poorly drained."
