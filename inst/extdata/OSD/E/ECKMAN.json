  "OVERVIEW": "The Eckman series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous stratified glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on glacial lake plains and stream terraces. Slopes ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick and includes part or all of the Bw horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 and 1 or 2 dry.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak or moderate prismatic or subangular or angular blocky.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam. It has 15 to more than 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam but may be stratified with very fine sand or fine sandy loam. Sandy to clayey glacial till or lacustrine materials are in the substrata in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Gardena soils are on nearly level and concave areas of the lake plains.  They have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Great Bend and Overly soils are on heavier textured lake plains.  They are fine-silty.  Zell soils are on steep side slopes of stream valleys.  They do not have Bw horizons."
