  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 6 to 40 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizon of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  ESP ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum but increases as depth increases and exceeds 15 percent in the Cca horizon of some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock and are mainly from 1/4 to 3 inches in diameter but some cobbles and a few stones occur in some pedons.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section from some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is typically fine sandy loam but averages 8 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 45 to 82 percent and with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand and excluding textures coarser than loamy very fine sand.  This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

The soil formed in moderately thin calcareous moderately coarse textured materials weathered from soft sandstones and loamstones.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 57 degrees F."
