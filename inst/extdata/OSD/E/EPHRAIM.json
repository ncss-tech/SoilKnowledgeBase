    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are saturated during some period within 60 inches of the surface.  They have chroma of 1 if not mottled or if mottled chroma of 2 at some depth between depths  of 20 and 40 inches.  Organic matter content either decreases irregularly with depth or remains above 0.35 percent to a depth of 50 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 40 to 55 percent in the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. at a depth of about 20 inches.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from silt loam to silty clay, but the average is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  The C horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Sand or loamy sand strata occur below 40 inches in some pedons.  Buried A1 horizons are common."
