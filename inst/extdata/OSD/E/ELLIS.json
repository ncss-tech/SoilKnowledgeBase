  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of solum is 20 to 40 inches.  It is clay throughout with clay content ranging from 40 to 60 percent.  Siliceous and ironstone pebbles range from none to a few throughout.  Indurated iron spheroidal concretions 4 to 24 inches in diameter range from none to 1 to 3 concretions each 400 to 600 feet horizontal distance.  Pressure faces and small slickensides range from few to common below the A horizon.  When dry, the surface forms a crust up to 1/2-inch thick. Cracks extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches. Cracks remain open 120 to 150 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Horizons with moist value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline and most pedons are noncalcareous.\nThe Bw and Bss1 horizons has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Gray colors are inherited from the shale.  Redox concentrations in shades of brown, yellow and olive range from none to common or the matrix is mottled with these colors.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  It is calcareous in the lower part of some pedons.  Calcium carbonate concretions and masses range from none to a few.\nThe BSS2 horizon is in shades of gray, olive yellow, or brown typically with few to common mottles of these colors. Some pedons have a mottled matrix.  The reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and calcareous in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate concretions and masses range from none to common.\nThe C horizon is mottled or interbedded with colors in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or olive.  It is clay intermixed and interbedded with soft shale. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline with or without calcium carbonate concretions and soft masses.   Some pedons have a few gypsum crystals between the interbedded layers."

Bleiblerville, Branyon, Burleson, Dimebox, Fairlies, Houston Black, Leson and Slidell soils have moist chroma of 1 throughout. Clarita and Tamford soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the subsoil. Fairlie soils are underlain by chalk below 40 inches. Heiden, Luling, Sanger, and Slidell soils have sola over 40 inches thick. Watonga soils have mean temperature cooler than 64 degrees. Ovan soils have sola over 80 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ellis soils are on erosional uplands on dominantly convex slopes or plane surfaces.  They are on sideslopes and low escarpments above drainageways.  Slopes are mostly between 5 and 12 percent but range from 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in weakly consolidated shales of Cretaceous Age.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 43 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 230 to 250 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 400 feet.  Annual Thornthwaite P-E indices ranges from 44 to 66."

Bazette and Crockett soils have clayey Bt horizons.Burleson and Heiden soils have mollic colored clayey A horizons with sola thicker than 40 inches.

Native vegetation is a moderate stand of little bluestem, indiangrass, sideoats grama and Texas wintergrass and a few small mesquite, elm, and hackberry trees.  Prickly pear cacti are common in places."
