    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Evadale series was formerly included with the Wrightsville series. A former ponded phase of the Evadale series is now included with the Camptown series.  The classification was changed from a fine family to fine-silty family during the correlation of the MLRA 152B update.  Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization laboratory at the type location and data from other pedons show the particle-size control section to be dominantly fine-silty.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 75 cm (10 to 30 in).  (Btg/Eg, Btg/Eg1 and Btg/Eg2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A and Eg horizons)\nGlossic horizon: 15 to 61 cm (6 to 24 in) (Eg/Btg, Btg/Eg and Btg/Eg1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) (Btg/Eg1, Btg/Eg2 and the Btg horizons)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S94TX-241-001 from the type location in Jasper County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization laboratory from the series type location in Jasper County (S94TX-B/E241-001), a representative pedon in Newton County, Texas (S00TX-351-003), and from Hardin County, Texas (S96TX199-005).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
