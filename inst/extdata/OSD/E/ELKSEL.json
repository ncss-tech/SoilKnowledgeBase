  "OVERVIEW": "The Elksel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in\ncolluvium and residuum from andesite, latite, and basalt.  Elksel soils\nare on mountain sides and have slopes of 30 to 60 percent.\nPermeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14\ninches, and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
