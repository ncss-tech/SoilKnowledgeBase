Altezita soils are very shallow, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on beveled summits.  Esquila soils are clayey, do not have a mollic epipedon, have smecitic mineralogy, and occur on toeslopes of plateaus. Herrada soils are fine-loamy, do not have a mollic epipedon, and occur on summits and footslopes of undulating plateaus.  Sabroso soils are clayey-skeletal, do not have a mollic epipedon, and occur on south-facing backslopes of mesas.  Verono soils are clayey-skeletal and are on north-facing backslopes of mesas."
