The well drained Wakenda soils are on more sloping or are on narrower summits in areas with greater relief.  The somewhat poorly drained Bethalto soils and the moderately well drained Downsouth soils do not have a mollic epipedon and typically are nearer the drainageways.  The poorly drained Mascoutah soils are on lower parts of the landform nearby.  They contain more clay in the surface layer and do not have an argillic horizon."
