  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 24 inches in thickness and extends into the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.  Depth to carbonates is greater than 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 7 percent sand.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, but it is silty clay loam in the lower part of the A horizon in some pedons.  Clay content is 20 to 30 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral depending upon liming practices.\nSome pedons have an AB or a BA horizon.  Other pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt, Btg, BC or BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Redoximorphic iron depletions and concentrations have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is silty clay loam in the upper part and silty clay loam or silt loam in the lower part.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent in the upper part and is 20 and 30 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral, and ranges to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe CBg, Cg or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic iron depletions and concentrations commonly have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 to 8.  Clay content is 18 to 25 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

Brenton, Elburn, Frankenmuth, Keller, Lafayette, Lawndale, Lisbon, Mundelein, Raub, Rowley, and Shannondale soils contain more than 7 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Harco soils contain carbonates within a depth of 40 inches.  Hacreek and Loran soils have a paralithic contact in the series control section.  Higginsville soils average less than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Muscatune and Nevin soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 56 degrees F.  Rooks soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edwardsville soils are on nearly level or gently sloping summits on till plains.  Slope gradients typically are between 1 and 3 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in loess.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 400 to 800 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bethalto, Downsouth, Mascoutah, and Wakenda soils.  The well drained Wakenda soils are on more sloping or are on narrower summits in areas with greater relief.  The somewhat poorly drained Bethalto soils and the moderately well drained Downsouth soils do not have a mollic epipedon and typically are nearer the drainageways.  The poorly drained Mascoutah soils are on lower parts of the landform nearby.  They contain more clay in the surface layer and do not have an argillic horizon."
