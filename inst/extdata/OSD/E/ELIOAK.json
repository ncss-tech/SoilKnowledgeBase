  "OVERVIEW": "The Elioak series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in materials weathered from micaceous crystalline rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 5 to 10 feet.  Angular rock fragments of white quartzite, from gravel to stone size, range from 0 to 20 percent by volume throughout and are commonly most abundant on or near the surface.  Mineralogy is dominated by kaolinite.  Unlimed reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A and E horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Value of 3 is confined to the A horizon, which is less than 4 inches thick.  The A horizon is silt loam, loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam high in silt, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe B horizons have hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 except in subhorizons that are variegated, which may have hue that is less red.  The Bt horizons range from silty clay loam or clay loam to silty clay with the average clay content of the particle size control section between 35 and 45 percent.  Clay films are of the same color as the matrix or are one unit lower in value, chroma, or both.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The BC horizon is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam, but includes textures of the Bt horizons.  The tendency toward platiness in the lower Bt and BC horizons are inherent from rock structure.\nThe C horizon is commonly variegated in shades of red and yellow, but in some pedons the color is uniform in hue of 10R to 7.5YR with value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 3 through 8. The C horizon is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam, or less commonly silty clay loam.  The C horizon has a higher mica content than the solum.  It is 15 inches to several feet in thickness."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Culpeper and Minnieville series are in the same family.  Culpeper soils have rock fragments of sandstone, chert, or other mixtures of sedimentary rocks.  Minnieville soils have developed over hornblende gneiss and hornblende schist and do not have fragments of quartz muscovite schist.\nThe Agnos, Appling, Braddock, Cecil, Christiana, Dunmore, Frederick, Georgeville, Groseclose, Hayesville, Herndon, Howell, Hulett, Madison, Mayodan, Muse, Norton, Pacolet, Sequoia, Trappist, Turbeville, Unison, and Wedowee series are similar soils in related families.  Agnos, Braddock, Groseclose, Howell, Muse, Norton, Sequoia, Trappist, and Unison soils have mixed mineralogy.  The Appling, Cecil, Georgeville, Herndon, Hulett, Madison, Mayodan, Pacolet, and Wedowee soils have a thermic temperature regime.  The Christiana, Dunmore, Frederick, and Turbeville soils have sola thicker than 60 inches; in addition, the Turbeville soils have a thermic temperature regime.  Hayesville soils have oxidic mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elioak soils occupy summits and upper slopes in northern portions of the Piedmont Plateau.  Most slopes are less than 15 percent but range from 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from mica schists and phyllites, and to a minor extent from granitized schist and micaceous gneiss.  The climate is temperate and humid with a mean annual temperature of 45 to 55 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation of 40 inches."

Brandywine, Codorus, Comus, Hatboro, and Neshaminy soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Linganore and Mt.  Airy soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size family.  Chester, Glenelg, Glenville, Legore, and Neshaminy soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Legore, Linganore, Montalto, and Neshaminy soils have base saturation of greater than 35 percent in the C horizon.  Codorus, Comus, and Hatboro soils are on floodplains.  Glenville soils are on footslopes or near the heads of drainageways. Brandywine, Chester, Glenelg, Legore, Linganore, Manor, Montalto, Mt. Airy, and Neshaminy soils are in topographic positions similar to those of the Elioak soils."
