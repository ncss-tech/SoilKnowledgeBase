  "OVERVIEW": "The Easton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on till plains.  They formed in loamy till.  Permeability is moderate in the surface, moderately slow in the subsoil, and slow in the substratum.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 35 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is dominantly silt loam or loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume with approximately 90 percent being gravel and the remaining being dominantly cobbles.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the surface and subsurface, and from moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the subsoil and substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has weak to strong, very fine to coarse granular structure and is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak or moderate, thin to very thick platy, weak very fine subangular blocky or moderate very coarse prismatic primary structure.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 with chroma of 2 or less on faces of peds in some subhorizons within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.  It has weak or moderate, very fine or fine subangular blocky, thin or medium platy, very fine granular or moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to platy or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has weak or moderate, thin to thick platy, fine to medium angular blocky or weak or moderate very coarse prismatic structure that may part to platy or angular blocky or the horizon is massive. It is friable or firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in the same family. The Angelica, Deerheart, Gretor, and Gulf series are in closely related families.  Angelica and Deerheart soils are from outside of Region R.  Angelica soils have redder hues in the B horizon and have an active CEC class. Deerheart soils formed in glaciolacustrine material , have less than 5 percent rock fragments throughout, and have a semiactive CEC class. Gretor soils are moderately deep to bedrock, are acid, and have an active CEC class.  Gulf soils formed in glacial outwash deposits and have an active CEC class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Easton soils are in depressions on glaciated uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soil developed in till derived primarily from metamorphosed lime- stone, calcareous sandstone and shale.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 40 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 350 to 800 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  The classification is updated to Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Aeric Endoaquepts with this revision to conform to the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 8th edition, 1998.  The former classification was  Fine-loamy, mixed, nonacid, frigid Aeric Haplaquepts.  2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 inches (Ap and Eg horizons).\nb. Albic horizon - the zone from 9 to 15 inches (Eg horizon).\nc. Cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 24 inches (Bg horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics are Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin 137; Characterization Data and composite data from the Field Appraisal of Resource Management Systems compiled by Dr. Paul R. Hepler, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Maine, Orono, Maine.\nThe Soil Interpretation Record numbers for the Easton series are: Easton, ME0046; and Easton, stony, ME0093.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
