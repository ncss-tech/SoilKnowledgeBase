  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Elvira series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium on flood plains.  These soils have moderate permeability in the solum and rapid permeability in the underlying material.  The Elvira soils are high in free iron.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  Depth of free carbonates is greater than 48 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The\nA horizon typically is black (10YR 2/1 or N 2/0) but ranges to very dark gray (10YR 3/1).  Texture of the A horizon commonly is silty clay loam but ranges to include silt loam and clay loam.  There are common or many dark red (2.5YR 3/6), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3 and 3/4) or reddish brown (5YR 4/3 to 5/4) Fe and Mn oxides, oxide stains or mottles in the A horizon.  The A horizon ranges from neutral to medium acid.  An AB horizon or BA horizon is in some pedons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Colors in the Bwhorizon and the BCg horizon are commonly the same as in the Bg horizon but subhorizons with matrix colors of 7.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6 are in the range.  In some pedons, these colors are in a mottled matrix with grayer colors.  Oxides and mottles in the B horizon are similar to those in the A horizon.  The B horizons commonly are silty clay loam, but thin horizons of clay loam are in the range.  Clay content of the B horizons ranges from 28 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hues of 2.5Y or 5Y with values of 4 to 6 and chromas of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Cg horizon commonly is silty clay loam but ranges to clay loam.  The Cg horizon ranges from neutral to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon typically is sandy loam or loamy sand, but strata ranging from clay loam to loamy sand are common."

All of these series lack the concentrations of Fe and Mn oxides in the B horizon and Fe and Mn accumulation in the A horizon.  Free iron is higher in Elvira than these soils.  Also, Beaucoup and Gorham soils are Fluvaquentic, and Colo and Sawmill soils are Cumulic."

Slope gradient is usually less than 1 percent but ranges up to 2 percent for short distances.  Elvira soils formed in silty alluvial sediments that commonly overlay stratified loamy or sandy sediments below 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is from about 47 to 52 degreesF, and mean annual precipitation is from 32 to 35 inches."
