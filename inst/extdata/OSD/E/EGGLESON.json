  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches and the organic matter content of the mixed upper 10 inches is estimated to be more than 1 percent and decreases irregularly with depth. The depth to a high water table is 2 to 3 feet during the spring. The particle-size control section has less than 5 percent clay, more than 50 percent fine sand and coarser, and more than 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A and AC horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. The A horizon is loam with 10 to 15 percent clay. The AC horizon is sandy loam with 5 to 10 percent clay. Rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles in the A horizon and 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles in the AC horizon. The A horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. The C2 and C3 horizons are multicolored. Texture is loamy sand or sand with 0 to 5 percent clay. It has 40 to 50 percent gravel, 20 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones. Redox concentations are few or common, fine or medium, and faint or distinct in the lower part of the C horizon and within a depth of 30 to 40 inches. Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."
