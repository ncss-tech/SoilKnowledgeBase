  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 45 to 80 inches.  Reaction of the soil ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid except for the surface in limed areas.  Thickness of epipedon with chroma 2 or 3 and value of 3 is less than 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles in shades of brown or gray below depths of about 24 inches range from none to many.  Some pedons have buried subhorizons within the Bw horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the Bw horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam."
