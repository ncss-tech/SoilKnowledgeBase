  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.\nThe Simoda, Eldred, and Kinzua series are in related families. Simoda soils lack an argillic horizon, Eldred soils lack a fragipan and Kinzua soils lack a fragipan and redoximorphic features in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Carrollton and Frewsburg soils are related series that have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Elko series is being proposed as a frigid equivalent of the mesic Cookport series. The surface 2 to 10 inches in some pedons have a sequence of horizons similar to spodosols. Some pedons have evidence of a silt mantle in the upper 20 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 3 inches (A horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 19 inches (Bw horizon).\nc. Argillic horizon - the zone from 19 to 26 inches (Bt and Btx horizons).\nd. Fragipan - the zone from 26 to 58 inches (Btx1, Btx2 horizons).\ne. Aquic subgroup - as evidenced by low chroma redoximorphic features in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon from the National Soil Survey Laboratory.  Pedon number S98NY009-02.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
