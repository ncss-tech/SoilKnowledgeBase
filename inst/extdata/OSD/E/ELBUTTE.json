(A horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the great group of Haplocambids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
