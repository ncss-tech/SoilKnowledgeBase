  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eloika series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash or ablation till of mixed mineralogy with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on terraces, terrace breaks, and till plains and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
