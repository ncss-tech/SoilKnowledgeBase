Some areas are cultivated for production of small grains, alfalfa, hay, and grasses; or are used for grazing. Overstory vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, western larch and grand fir. Understory vegetation is mallow, ninebark, Oregon-grape, snowbrush ceanothus, snowberry, and wild rose. Ground vegetation is kinnikinnick, myrtle pachystima, strawberry, pinegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass."
