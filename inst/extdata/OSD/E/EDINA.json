Barbert soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C (51 degrees F) in the control section. Crestmeade soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 13 degrees C (56 degrees F) in the control depth. Filbert soils are more than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Fillmore soils are at elevations above 335 feet (1100 feet) and typically have a thicker mollic epipedon. Massie and Scott soils are in areas that receive less than 865 mm (34 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Sturges soils have a subhorizon of the upper part of the argillic horizon with chroma greater than 2 in the mtarix. Triplett soils have more than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 inches) between November and April in normal years. These soils are subject to ponding where they occur in depressions. Potential for surface runoff is negligible in depressions, and ranges to high on the flats. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Permeability is very slow or slow."
