  "OVERVIEW": "The Erin series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in a 3 to 10 foot thick layer of shale rich till.  Underlying this is a calcareous loamy till.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to lime ranges from 40 to 75 inches.  The solum contains up to 10 percent coarse fragments, however, a dominant portion of this is shale that may not make the definition of a fragment.  The upper 12 inches is free of coarse fragments and contains a high content of silt in some pedons.\nThe A horizon is typically silt loam or loam but ranges to clay loam in eroded areas.  The A has value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  The Ap has value of 3 or 4 moist and 6 dry.\nThe E has value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe B/E horizon has up to 15 percent of coatings of E as interfingering into the Bt horizon.  The Bt portion has properties similar to the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value or 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  Subhorizons with high chroma mottles are not considered outside the range.  Content of clay ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Textures included are clay loam, silty clay loam, clay or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value or 4 through 8 and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  It contains 2 through 10 percent coarse fragments with some parts of it dominated by shale fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  No known competing series in this taxonomic class.  Selected similar soils are Hortonville, Kilkenny, Lerdal, Marlette, Perrington and Shorewood series.  Hortonville and Marlette series lack the clay to quality for the fine particle size class.  Kilkenny and Shorewood soils lack quantative interfingering of E horizon in to the B horizon.  Also, Shorewood soils lack fragments in the solum.  Lerdal soils have lower chroma colors in the upper solum and are wet for longer periods.  Perrington soils have thinner sola and are of mixed minerology."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Erin soils are on gently sloping to very steep terrain within the end moraines of the Des Moines lobe of the late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Slopes are short and are plane or convex, and have gradients of 2 to 35 percent.  The regolith in the upper 3 to 10 feet is rich in shale minerals, especially in the sand to pebble sized fraction.  This shale is softened and difficult to separate by particle class separates.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 27 to 30 inches."
