  "OVERVIEW": "The Eboda series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, welded tuff, shale, sandstone or conglomerate.  Eboda soils are on side slopes of mountains, plateaus, hills and rock core areas of fan piedmont remnant sideslopes.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
