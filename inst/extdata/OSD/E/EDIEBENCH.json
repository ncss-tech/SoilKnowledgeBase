Windicreek soils are loamy-skeletal and are on nearly level to very steep dissected fan remnants derived dominantly from calcareous sandstone conglomerate.  Zeebar soils are loamy-skeletal and are formed in colluvium from quartzite, basalt and tuff and are on mountains, hillslopes, ridges and fan remnants."
