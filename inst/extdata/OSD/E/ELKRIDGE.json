  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils on canyon sides, escarpments, valley sides, ridges, structural benches, and hill slopes. They formed in volcanic ash and loess over material weathered from basalt rock. Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  They have moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
