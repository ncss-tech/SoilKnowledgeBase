These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 2,430 to 3,110 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 900 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
