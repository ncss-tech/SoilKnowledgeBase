  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from about 3-1/2 to 7 feet.  Kaolinite is the dominant mineral in the clay fraction with detectable amounts of illite, vermiculite, montmorillonite, chlorite and interstratified clays. Gravel, channers, and stone size fragments of quartzite and quartz are present throughout the profile. Rock fragments range from 5 to 40 percent in the horizons of the solum and from 10 to 90 percent in the C horizon. Weighted average of rock fragments is less than 35 percent in the control section. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and silt loam. The A horizon is generally channery or gravelly.\nThe Ap horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Values, when dry, are 6 or higher.  Textures are loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe B and BE horizons have hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Textures are primarily loam, particularly in the Bt2, but sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam and clay loam textures are included in the range. The silt content in the B horizon is less than 40 percent. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium blocky or subangular blocky. Clay films occur on ped faces, in pores and bridge sand grains in the Bt horizons.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam although it ranges to include loamy sand, sandy clay loam, and clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8. Texture is dominantly sandy loam although it ranges to include loamy sand, loam and clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arcola, Bedington, Bucks, Collington, Edneytown, Freehold, Germania (Tentative), Gilpin, Gladstone, Joanna, Leedsville, Millstone, Penargyl, Pennval, Pigeonroost, Pineville, Quakertown, Rayne, Shelocta, Syenite, and Wist series in the same family. Arcola series formed in materials that weathered from Triassic and Jurassic interbedded siltstone, and fine sandstone. Bedington, Gilpin, and Rayne soils formed in residuum of primarily shale and siltstone with lesser amounts of fine-grained sandstone. The Bucks soils formed in a silt mantle over weathered red shale, siltstone, or fine grained sandstone. The Germania series (Tentative Series and not officially established) soils formed in alluvial fans. The Leedsville soils formed in residuum from Triassic-Jurassic interbedded sandstone and conglomerate of the Culpeper Basin. The Quakertown soils formed in residuum weathered from fine grained sandstone, siltstone, or thin bedded argillite. Collington, Freehold, and Wist soils formed in glauconite bearing fluvio-marine deposits. Edneytown and Pigeonroost soils formed in felsic to mafic, igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks. Gladstone soils formed in residuum and colluvium of granitic gneiss. Joanna soils formed in Triassic red sandstone and quartz pebble conglomerate. Millstone soils formed in loamy alluvium on stream terraces. Penargyl soils are formed in young glacial till derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock overlying residuum weathered from acid brown shale on gently sloping to sloping ground moraine on uplands in the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau and Catskill Mountains Province. Pennval, Pineville, and Shelocta soils formed in colluvium of shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Syenite soils formed in loess over granite residuum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level to very steep hills and ridges. The regolith is from metaquartzite, quartzite, quartz schist and quartz conglomerate.  Stones are common surface features. Climate is continental with warm summers and cold winters. Average annual air temperature is 47 to 59 degrees F. Rainfall averages 35 to 48 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year."

Brandywine, Catoctin and Dekalb lack argillic horizons and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Chester, Glenelg and Highfield soils have Bt horizons containing more than 40 percent silt. Gladstone soils are predominantly formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic gneiss. Hazleton and Manor soils lack an argillic horizon and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section."
