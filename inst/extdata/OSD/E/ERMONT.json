  "OVERVIEW": "The Ermont series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic tuff. Ermont soils are on escarpments, hills and ridges. Slopes are 4 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
