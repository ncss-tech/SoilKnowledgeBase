  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to duripan is 24 to 40 inches. Depth to stratified cemented gravelly and cobbly alluvium is 28 to 50 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 degrees to 53 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is warmer than 41 degrees F.\nf.om February 20 to January 1. The soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is warmer than 47 degrees F. from about April 15 to December 1.  The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is usually dry all of the time from June until October or early November and is moist in some or all parts when the soil is warmer than 47 degrees F. only from April 20 to July, and from October 20 to December 1. It is usually dry and is not moist more than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is warmer than 47 degrees F. The soil is slightly acid or neutral throughout the profile. Pebbles, cobblestone, or stones are present on the lower edges of the mounds where this soil is found, forming a \"stone ring.\" Sand/clay ratio of the upper 15 inches is 1 to 4 and the organic matter averages more than 0.5 percent in the upper 15 inches.\nThe A horizon is pale brown and brown to pinkish gray (lOYR 6/3, 6/2, 5/3, 5/2; 7.5YR 6/2, 5/2) dry and dark yellowish brown to very dark grayish brown (lOYR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/2, 3/4, 3/2) moist. The upper 10 inches when mixed have dry value of 6. The A horizon has weak subangular blocky or platy structure or is massive. A3 horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon is brown, reddish brown, reddish gray, or dark reddish gray dry and brown, dark brown, reddish brown, dark reddish brown, or dark reddish gray moist in 7.5YR or 5YR hue. The upper part tends to have 7.5YR hue and the lower part tends to be 5YR hue. The Bt horizon is gravelly and cobbly light clay loam, clay loam and sandy clay loam averaging 30 to 35 percent clay in the textural control section. Pebbles and cobbles average less than 35 percent although some subhorizons are higher. A thin,commonly discontinuous, horizon of very gravelly clay often occurs just above the duripan. The Bt horizon has moderate or strong angular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Csim horizon has about 80 to 90 percent by volume of cobbles and pebbles with opal coatings on the underside. Manganese stains are common in the upper part. This horizon is massive or platy with thin continuous opal laminar layers in the upper part or is massive and indurated. The lower part is massive and very firm or extremely firm when moist."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deerlodge, Ditchcamp, Louie, Madras, Ochoco, Packwood, Puls, Selah, and Thoms series. Deerlodge soils have mildly and moderately alkaline B2t horizons and are calcareous in the lower horizons. Ditchcamp soils have hard bedrock below the duripan at depths of 25 to 40 inches. Louie soils have a calcareous Bt horizon, lime-cemented Cm horizons, and a xeric moisture regime. Madras soils have a paralithic contact of tuffaceous sandstone at depths of 25 to 40 inches and have 10 to 30 percent pumice fragments. Ochoco and Selah soils are mildly to moderately alkaline and calcareous in their lower horizons. Packwood, Puls and Thoms soils have duripans at depths of less than 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Exel soils are nearly level to moderately sloping and occur on nearly level to gently rolling hummocky lake terraces at elevations of 4,700 to 5,200 feet. Exel soils typically occupy the mounds and Thoms the intermound areas. They formed in lake terraces alluvium derived from basic igneous and pyroclastic rocks. The climate is semiarid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. Snowfall is 24 to 48 inches. Average January temperature is 28 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 49 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 80 to 110 days."

Bieber soils have clayey B2t horizons and are less than 20 inches deep to a duripan.  Barnard soils have clayey B2t horizon and have mollic epipedons. Delma soils have mollic epipedons and lack duripans. Lovejoy soils have abrupt A-B textural boundaries. Modoc soils have mollic epipedons."
