Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Typically, carbonates are present at a depth of less than 51 centimeters (20 inches).\n3/2007 RRH: A stream terrace phase or new series will need to be established for the Els soils located on non-flooded stream terraces of valleys.\n3/2007 RRH: Introductory Paragraph: revised landform/landscape; Typical Pedon: changed C horizon to Cg1 and Cg horizon to Cg2. Changed chroma of Cg1 horizon to 2 based on original pedon description notes. Range in Characteristics: revised; Geographic Setting: revised; Geographically Associated Soils: revised, deleted Dunday and Gannett soils as these soils do not occur at the type location, added Marlake soils as these soils occur at the type location; Use and Vegetation: revised\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for pedon IDs 87NE031102 and 91NE031025 in Cherry County, Nebraska are available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory and the Nebraska Department of Roads. Additional Soil Survey Laboratory data is available for Blaine, Holt, Morrill, Rock, and Sheridan Counties in Nebraska. Pedon ID 85NE031081 represents the Typical Pedon and is in NASIS.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
