  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to loamy residuum range from 15 to 39 inches.  Base saturation (by NH4OAc) is less than 50 percent at 40 inches.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent in the loamy residuum.  Coarse fragments typically are absent in the sandy mantle but the volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges up to 15 percent in some pedons.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 3 to 15 percent in the loamy residuum.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the sandy mantle and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the loamy residuum.  Saturation occurs at or near the surface much of the year in most years.  Redox features are throughout the soil below the A horizon in some pedons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  It has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  Value dry is less than 5.5.  The A horizon is loamy sand or mucky sand.\nThe Bg or B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Typically, it is the color of the uncoated sand grains with some organic staining.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe Cg or C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The color is that of the uncoated sand grains.  The Cg or C horizon is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.\nThe 2Cg or 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Thin strata of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons.  The 2Cg or 2C horizon averages 10 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 55 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe 2Cr horizon has has color and texture like the 2Cg horizon described above.  It is interbedded sandstone and shale."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are in drainageways and depressions on pediments underlain by interbedded sandstone and shale (Eau Claire and Mt. Simon formations of the Elk Mound group).  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  Elm Lake soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium over loamy residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1400 feet."

The very poorly drained Citypoint soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Elm Lake soils where there is 16 to 51 inches of organic material over residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale.  The moderately well drained Ludington soils and the somewhat poorly drained Fairchild soils form a drainage sequence with Elm Lake soils.  The poorly drained Veedum soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Elm Lake soils where there is 20 to 40 inches of loamy soil over interbedded sandstone and shale."

Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy mantle, moderately slow or moderate in the loamy residuum, and very slow to moderately slow in the interbedded sandstone and shale.  Elm Lake soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth from 1 foot above to 1 foot below the surface much of the time from September to June in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The water table is perched on bedrock (2Cr).  This water table fits neither the definition of episaturation or of endosaturation.  We have suggested to the classification staff at NSSC that the definition of episaturation be expanded to include water tables perched on bedrock.   Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - from 0 to 4 inches (Oa, A); aquic feature - saturation at or near the surface much of the year typically with low chroma below the A horizon (Color below the A horizon is typically that of uncoated sand grains); Humaqueptic feature - it is assumed that mixing the upper 6 inches will result in an Ap horizon with value moist of 3 or less and value dry of 5 or less and base saturation (by NH4OAc) at 40 inches is less than 50 percent; siliceous feature - less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sandy alluvium (0.2 to 20 mm fraction).\nADDITIONAL DATA - Soil Interpretation Record - WI0035\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
