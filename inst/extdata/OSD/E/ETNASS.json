They have a forest litter layer and lack an argillic horizon.  Sedgway soils are on nearby summits and sideslopes.  They average less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and do not have cracks or slickensides. Tophat soils are on nearby sideslopes. They formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources, lack desiccation cracks, and lack intersecting slickensides within 40 inches of the soil surface."
