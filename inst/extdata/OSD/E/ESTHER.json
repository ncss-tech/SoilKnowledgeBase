Wallface soils occupy similar postitions on the landscape and are moderately deep to bedrock. Santanoni soils occupy steeper areas and are sandy-skeletal. Skylight and Couchsachraga soils are generally on higher and steeper areas of the landscape, are shallow and very shallow respectively, and are sandy. Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock in convex positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. This series was established to recognize Andic soil properties in tills of the cryic areas in the Adirondack High Peaks Region of New York. The series is named for one of the Adirondack High Peaks. Some pedons lacking E horizons will key out as Pachic or Typic Fulvicryands. These are similar soils in use and management to the Aquandic Humicryods concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:\na. Albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 10 inches (E horizon).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 28 inches (Bhs horizons).\nc. Humic feature - have more than 6 percent organic carbon throughout the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.\nd. Andic feature - andic soil properties throughout horizons that have a total thickness of 10 inches or more within 30 inches either of the mineral soil surface or of the top of an organic layer with andic soil properties, whichever is shallower.\ne. Densic contact - the zone from 33 to 72 inches (Cd horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedons: S93-NY-031-011, and S94-NY-031-005.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
