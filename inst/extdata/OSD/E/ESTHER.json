  "OVERVIEW": "The Esther series consists of moderately well drained, loamy soils that are very deep to bedrock, and moderately deep to dense lodgement till. They are on back-slopes and foot-slopes in mountainous areas. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high in the organic surface and mineral subsurface, moderately high or high in the mineral solum, and moderately low to moderately high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS: 1. This series was established to recognize Andic soil properties in tills of the cryic areas in the Adirondack High Peaks Region of New York. The series is named for one of the Adirondack High Peaks. Some pedons lacking E horizons will key out as Pachic or Typic Fulvicryands. These are similar soils in use and management to the Aquandic Humicryods concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:\na. Albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 10 inches (E horizon).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 28 inches (Bhs horizons).\nc. Humic feature - have more than 6 percent organic carbon throughout the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.\nd. Andic feature - andic soil properties throughout horizons that have a total thickness of 10 inches or more within 30 inches either of the mineral soil surface or of the top of an organic layer with andic soil properties, whichever is shallower.\ne. Densic contact - the zone from 33 to 72 inches (Cd horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedons: S93-NY-031-011, and S94-NY-031-005.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
