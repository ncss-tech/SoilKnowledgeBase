  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Etil soils are on slightly elevated beach ridges along the shoreline of the Great Salt Lake.  They formed in beach sand and eolian sands derived mainly from oolites (ooliths).  Oolites are small, rounded, sand-sized accretionary bodies formed of concentric layers of calcium carbonate around a sand-sized nucleus of mineral or organic origin and formed in wave-agitated waters.  Mineral grains derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks are also a component of the soil parent material.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,300 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches, the annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Palisade and Saltair soils as well as the miscellaneous area playas.  Palisade soils are coarse-loamy and have calcic horizons.  Saltair soils have salic horizons and a seasonal high water table at or near the surface.  These soils generally occur on slightly lower topographic positions than the Etil soil.  Playas are barren lakebeds between open saline water and vegetated beach ridges."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; very low surface runoff; rapid permeability (high or very high saturated hydraulic conductivity). Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.5 and 5.0 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) between April and August.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Depth to the water table depends on nearness to and elevation of areas above the salt playas."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Etil soils are used for rangeland.  The present vegetation is Indian ricegrass, black greasewood, alkali sacaton, rabbitbrush, shadscale, cheatgrass, spiny hopsage, and Wyoming big sagebrush."
