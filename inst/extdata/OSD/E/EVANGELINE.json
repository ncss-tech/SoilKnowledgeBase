Typically these soils have less than 3 percent total sand but range to 10 percent.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4, 3/4).  Very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark brown (10YR 3/3) are within the range where less than 6 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon, where present, is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4).  The A horizon is silt loam.  It is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe B21t horizon is yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8).  It is heavy silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid.  A discontinuous A'2 horizon of pale brown light silt loam interfingers in the mid Bt horizon and occupies from 10 to 15\npercent of the mass.  Lower Bt horizon colors are yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8), reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 5/4), brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), or yellowish brown (10YR\n5/4).  5YR hues occur as matrix, mottles, or surfaces of peds in some part of the lower Bt horizon in all pedons.  Texture is silty clay loam.  It is very strongly acid through medium acid."

Other related series include the Atwood, Dossman, Duralde, Falkner, Glenmora, Memphis, Messer, Muskogee, and Vian series.  Atwood and Vian soils lack prominent skeletans in the lower Bt horizons.  Dossman soils have clay contents that decrease by 20 percent from the maximum within 50 inches from the top of the B horizons.  Duralde, Falkner, Glenmora, and Muskogee soils have gray mottles within 30 inches of the surface, and in addition, Falkner and Glenmora soils have less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the B horizon.  Memphis soils lack interfingers of A' into the Bt horizon.  Messer soils have thick silt loam B1 horizons and more than 10 percent sand."

Slope gradient is from 1 to 5 percent.  These soils are developed in thick (15 to 30 feet) oxidized and leached, pre-Peorian age loess.  The average temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is about 58 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E index is near 70."
