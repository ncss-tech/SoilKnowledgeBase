It is assumed to be a udic regime bordering ustic, but may possibly be ustic. Further study is needed to resolve this issue.  Currently, Eody soils have a cryic temperature regime and are in a udic soil moisture regime bordering on ustic.\nWhen established, the Eody series was classified as fine, mixed, nonacid Typic Cryorthents.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
