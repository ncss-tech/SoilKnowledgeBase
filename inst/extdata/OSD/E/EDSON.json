Cumley soils have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are moderately well drained.  McCurdy soils have high chroma masses of redox concentrations in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are moderately well drained.  Honeygrove soils average more than 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Orford soils have an umbric epipedon."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from schist and phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 200 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90  to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  he frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
