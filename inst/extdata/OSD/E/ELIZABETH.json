  "OVERVIEW": "The Elizabeth series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) of loamy material weathered from dolomitic limestone.  These soils are on gently sloping to very steep ridges and side slopes on uplands.  Slope ranges from 4 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters (33 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and moderately slow to very slow in the limestone bedrock depending on the amount of weathered rock. Saturation does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters (6 feet) during the wettest periods of normal years."
