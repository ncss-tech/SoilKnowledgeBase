Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy material and low to moderately high (0.01 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the limestone bedrock depending on the amount of weathered rock. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and moderately slow to very slow in the limestone bedrock depending on the amount of weathered rock. Saturation does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters (6 feet) during the wettest periods of normal years."
