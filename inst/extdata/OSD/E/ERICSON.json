Ansel and Edlow soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the B2t horizon. Caratelleia soils have average annual temperatures less than 42 degrees F. and are extremely stony or very stony in the C horizons. Lick soils lack an AB horizon and have formed from material with randomly distributed granitic rock fragments (glacial till). Limber, Sapphire, Schofield, Schule and Woodrock soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches. Grimstone, Indart, Perceton and Tongue River soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches. Swifton soils have a B2t horizon below depths of 24 to 60 inches. Hierro and Uinta soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the control section. Owlcreek soils are slightly acid (pH 6.1) to neutral (pH 7.3). Peeler soils have a gravelly coarse sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy clay or cobbly sandy clay loam B2t horizon. Trapper and Whitefish soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and have continuous horizons of lime accumulation."
