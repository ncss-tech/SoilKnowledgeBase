  "OVERVIEW": "The Eelweir series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy deltaic or glaciofluvial sediments.  They are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on the edge of lake plains and on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout and are mostly gravel.  Free carbonates are present in some pedons at a depth of 40 to 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface layer, from moderately acid to neutral in the subsoil, and moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  There are thin layers of loamy sand or loamy fine sand in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon up to 10 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very fine sandy loam to sand.  Some pedons have layers of clay or silty clay below depth of 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Kalurah soils have more that 5 percent rock fragments in the solum and substratum.\nThe Bomoseen, Boothbay, Canalou, Elmwood, Fisk, Georgia, and Minoa series are in similar families.  The Bomoseen, Georgia, and Minoa soils have a mesic temperature regime, and the Canalou soils are thermic.  Boothbay soils have a fine-silty particle size control section.  The Elmwood soils are coarse-loamy over clayey.  Fisk soils are sandy over loamy."

The soils developed in loamy, glacio-fluvial or glacio-lacustrine sediments.  They often overlie calcareous glacio- marine sediments at depths of 40 to 80 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F; and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches.  The growing season ranges from 120 to 150 days."

Elmwood soils have a clayey substratum above 40 inches.  Croghan soils are on similar landscape positions as Eelweir soils but are sandy.  Hogansburg and Kalurah soils formed in glacial till and are on higher positions in the surrounding landscape.  Mino soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on nearby lower parts of the landscape.  Nicholville soils are in similar landscape positions as Eelweir soils but have a higher silt content."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 29 inches (Bw horizons). C. Aquic subgroup feature - mottles with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the surface (Bw2 horizon).  D. Dystric subgroup feature - lack free carbonates with 40 inches of the soil surface. E. Eutrochrepts great group - base saturation that is 60 percent or more in some subhorizon between depths of 10 and 30 inches (Bw horizons)."
