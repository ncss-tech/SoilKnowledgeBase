The climate is hot arid continental. Elevation is 850 to 2,290 feet. Mean annual air temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F.  Precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, falling mainly as thunderstorms in July, August and September and as gentle rains in December and January.  The frost-free season is 240 to 325 days."
