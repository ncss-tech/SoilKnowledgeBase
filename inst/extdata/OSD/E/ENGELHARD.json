  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the A and C horizon ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches over loamy, sandy, or organic materials.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in A horizon, except where limed, and from very strongly acid to neutral in the C, 2Ab, or 2C horizons.  Most pedons contain few to common strata (0.1 to 4.0 inches thick) of loamy or sandy materials that are high in organic matter.  These strata are continuous or discontinuous and commonly increase with depth.  Most pedons have few to common flakes of mica.  Most pedons that have buried horizons.  These horizons may have small pockets of organic material 1.0 to 5.0 inches in diameter and relic roots.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 40 to more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section ranges from 80 to 95 percent very fine sand plus silt and less than 5 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Mottles are in shades of brown, gray, or black.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Mottles are in shades of brown, gray, olive, or black.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt.\nThe 2Ab horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of brown, gray, olive, or black.  It is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 7.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar series in closely related families are the Pasquotank, Weeksville, and Wysocking series.  Pasquotank and Weeksville soils have a cambic diagnostic subsurface horizon and contain more than 5 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Wysocking soils have more than 16 inches of organic material in the upper 32 inches of the soil."

They formed in sandy or silty lacustrine or possibly eolian sediments that are high in very fine sand.  Elevation range from 1 to 10 feet above sea level.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 43 to 56 inches, the frost-free season ranges from 205 to 260 days, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F."
