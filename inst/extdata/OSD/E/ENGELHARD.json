  "OVERVIEW": "The Engelhard series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils with moderately rapid permeability.  These soils formed in sandy lacustrine lake-wash sediments that contain a high content of very fine sand and are underlain by marine or fluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. near the type location.",

Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in A horizon, except where limed, and from very strongly acid to neutral in the C, 2Ab, or 2C horizons.  Most pedons contain few to common strata (0.1 to 4.0 inches thick) of loamy or sandy materials that are high in organic matter.  These strata are continuous or discontinuous and commonly increase with depth.  Most pedons have few to common flakes of mica.  Most pedons that have buried horizons.  These horizons may have small pockets of organic material 1.0 to 5.0 inches in diameter and relic roots.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 40 to more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section ranges from 80 to 95 percent very fine sand plus silt and less than 5 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.
