These soils formed in mixed alluvial and colluvial deposits weathered mostly from Permian redbeds and limestone.  The soils are in a hot and arid climate with annual precipitation ranging from 8 to 10 inches with most of this coming in June, July, and August.  The mean January temperature is 43 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 80 degrees F.; the average annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F.   The frost-free season is about 210 days."
