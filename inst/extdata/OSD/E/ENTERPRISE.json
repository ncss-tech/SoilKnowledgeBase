  "OVERVIEW": "The Enterprise series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sediments. These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep plains on terrace pediments in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in).",
