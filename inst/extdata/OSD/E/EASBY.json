It ranges from 7 to 25 inches in thickness.  The soil is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is clay loam or loam.  It contains accumulated salts.\nThe ABkyz horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It typically is clay loam, but is loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  Typically, accumulated salt or gypsum is in this horizon.  It commonly is mottled, but in those pedons where mottles are not present the chroma is 1 or less.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or less.  It is loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have coarser or finer textures below a depth of 40 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Revised 3/91.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to the depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon); calcic horizon - the zone from 7 to 22 inches (ABkyz and Bky horizons); salinity and alkalinity features - the EC of the surface layer is greater than 16 mmhos/cm (1.6 S/m).  The SAR is greater than 13 but the physical characteristics of a natric horizon are not present.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil was correlated as a taxadjunct to Ojata in Ramsey County, ND in 1984.  Refer to NDSU File Code No. S83ND019-250 (1- 6) for laboratory analysis of typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
