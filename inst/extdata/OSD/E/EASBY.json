It is clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It typically is clay loam, but is loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  Typically, accumulated salt or gypsum is in this horizon.  It commonly is mottled, but in those pedons where mottles are not present the chroma is 1 or less.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or less.
