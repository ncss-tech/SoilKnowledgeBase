  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the duripan are 14 to 20 inches.  These soils have a soil moisture regime that is xeric bordering on aridic.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 69 to 72 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick and can include the upper part of the Bt horizon.  The particle size control section has or contains 0 to 15 percent igneous rock fragments that are gravel in size and averages 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry, 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent gravel, but with incorporation of surface rock fragment content the A horizon yields gravelly texture modifiers.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BA horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 7.5YR, value is 4 or 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma is 2 or 3.  Texture is a loam or clay loam.  Rock fragment is 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  This horizon may absent in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value is 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma is 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly clay loam or clay loam.  Rock fragment is 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkq horizon has a hue of 10YR, value is 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma is 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  Rock fragment is 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Ckq horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value is 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma is 3 or 4.  Texture is very gravelly loamy coarse sand.   Clay content is 0 to 5 percent.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent gravel.  Reaction is moderately alkaline."
