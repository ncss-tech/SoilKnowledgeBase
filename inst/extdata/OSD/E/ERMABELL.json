The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the glacial outwash material (2C horizon) is 40 or more inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Base saturation is 85 to 100 percent throughout the profile.  The particle size control section contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent, the acid oxalate aluminum plus one half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.40 to 0.70 percent, and the 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 2 to 7 percent.   Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A and AC horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 moist.  It contains 0 to 5 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent pumice (0.5-2.0 millimeters).  It is ashy loamy fine sand, ashy loamy very fine sand and ashy fine sand.  It has a field estimated clay content of 2 to 10 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand.  It contains 35 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones with total rock fragment content of 45 to 80 percent.  It has a field estimated clay content of 1 to 5 percent."

The base saturation by ammonium acetate is 100 percent for the A1 and A2 horizons.  The organic carbon content for the A1 and A2 horizon is 0.61 and 0.34 respectively.  Assume over 0.6 percent in the upper 10 inches.\nandic soil properties - from the soil surface to 41 inches, data only available for the upper 31 inches.  The glass and glass coated aggregate is 66 to 73 percent in the very fine sand fraction.  The phosphate retention is 58 to 60 percent.  The acid oxalate aluminum plus one half the acid oxalate iron is 0.40 to 0.50 percent.  The 15-bar water content is 3 percent on both dried and undried sample.
