The soils formed in glacial till and volcanic ash.  The till was derived from a wide variety of rock.  Elwell soils are in a cool marine climate with cool, dry  summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The mean January temperature is 29 degrees F; mean July temperature is 59 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 160 days."
