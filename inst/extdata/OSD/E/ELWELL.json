  "OVERVIEW": "The Elwell series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Elwell soils are on mountain slopes and plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
