Content of gravels and channers range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 30 in the Bt horizon, and from 0 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons above any lithologic discontinuity. The soil ranges from neutral to strongly acid in the solum and strongly acid to extremely acid in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, silt loam, or rarely sandy loam. Some pedons have thin A horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe BA or BE horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, silt loam or sandy clay loam. Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, red, and yellow below the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon and shades of gray or olive below 40 inches. A few pedons have individual horizons of sandy loam below a depth of 24 inches.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of black, brown, yellow, gray and olive are common. It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons have a 2BC or 2C horizons with 35 to 80 percent gravel and cobbles and/or strongly contrasting particle size in comparison with overlying horizons.\nThe 2R horizon consists of sandstone, siltstone or shale bedrock and is weathered in places."

Albemarle, Allenwood, Arendtsville, Chetwynd, Eubanks, Leck Kill, Lonon, Shouns, Ungers and Whiteford soils have hues of 5YR or redder either throughout or in some subhorizon of the B horizon. Allegheny soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Cades, Chester, Glenelg and Tate soils have coarse fragments dominated by quartz, quartzite, granite, gneiss, metamonzonite, meta-arkosic sandstone, metasandstone, phyllite or schist. Cardova, Drapermill, Gilwood and Milldraper soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Elsinboro soils formed in alluvium weathered from micaceous crystalline rocks. Frankstown soils formed in upland residuum weathered from siliceous limestone and interbedded limy shale and siltstone. Meadowville soils formed in upland alluvium and underlying residuum weathered from basic and acidic rocks. Nixon soils contain detectable red shale detrital components in the coarse fragments and fine-earth fractions. Queponco and Reybold soils formed in loamy or silty fluvial and eolian deposits underlain by sandy and loamy fluvial and marine (fluviomarine) deposits. Murrill soils formed in colluvium weathered from acid sandstones and shales and the underlying residuum. Rhodiss soils formed in residuum weathered from felsic crystalline rock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ezel soils are on high strath terraces along rivers and streams, commonly separated from a constructional valley floor by steep hillsides. Slopes on these high terraces generally range from 0 to 15 percent, but include short steep slopes up to 20 percent. These soils formed where bedrock is thinly mantled by old alluvial deposits that washed from colluvial and residual soils weathered from Pennsylvanian aged sandstone, siltstone, shale, coal, and limestone. Near the type location the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 45 inches."

Allegheny, Cotaco, Knowlton, Morehead and Whitley soil are on lower stream terraces. Barbourville soils are on alluvial fans at the mouths of drainageways. Fedscreek, Hazleton, Helechawa, Rigley and Shelocta soils are on adjacent hillsides. Gilpin soils are on adjacent hillsides and ridgetops. Latham, Lily and Rayne soils are on ridgetops. Grigsby, Orrville, Pope and Rowdy soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains. Riney soils are on convex crests of strath terraces, generally adjacent to and above the Ezel Series. Allegheny, Barbourville, Cotaco, Grigsby, Helechawa, Knowlton, Morehead, Orrville, Pope, Riney, Rigley, Rowdy and Whitley soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock. Barbourville soils have umbric epipedons and lack argillic horizons. Cotaco and Morehead soils have low chroma iron depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Gilpin, Latham and Lily soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock. Grigsby, Orrville, Rowdy and Pope soils are on floodplains and lack argillic horizons. Knowlton soils are fine-silty and poorly drained. Riney soils are redder and have siliceous mineralogy. Whitley soils are fine-silty."
