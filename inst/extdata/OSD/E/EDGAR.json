  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Edgar soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches but are not dry in all parts above 12 inches for more than half the time that soil temperature at 20 inches is more than 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The solum is 11 to 15 inches thick.  The soil between depths of 10 and 40 inches is loam or light clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and 16 to 30 percent percent fine and coarser sands.  The soil is neutral to mildly alkaline in the noncalcareous part of the solum and moderately to strongly alkaline in the C horizons.  An Ap horizon ranging from 4 to 7 inches thick in cultivated fields has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B2 horizon has moderate or strong prismatic structure, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR and value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4.  The Cca horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y and dry value of 7 or 8.  It contains about 20 to 30 percent CaC03 equivalent."
