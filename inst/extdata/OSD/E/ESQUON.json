    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; high runoff; slow saturated hydraulic conductivity in the Ap, Bssg, Bss and Bkss horizons, moderate to moderately slow in the Bk horizon and impermeable in the 2Bkqm horizon.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from December through May.  In some areas a fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and surface of the soil from November through June and from the top of the duripan and 36 inches, (91 cm) below the surface of the soil from July through October.  Water frequently ponds up to 6 inches, (15 cm) above the surface for long duration from December through March.  Dams, levees, drainage ditches and leveling for agriculture have altered the frequency and duration of saturation, ponding and flooding."

This variability is attributed to specific farm management and or undulating depth to duripan.  Leveling and water management also influence the amount of carbonates in the soil.\nThis soil was previously mapped as Stockton brown phase in the Soil Survey of the Oroville, California, 1926, and the Soil Survey of the Chico Area, California, 1925.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Grab samples were sent to U.C. Davis in 1992 (Lab No.1760). Sample number is Biggs #53.  Characterization data from lab pedon number: 95P0511, NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
