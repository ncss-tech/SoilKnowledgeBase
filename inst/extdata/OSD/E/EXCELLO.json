  "OVERVIEW": "The Excello series consists of very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains, alluvial fans, and concave toeslopes. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium. Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.",

Beaucoup, Blackoar, Colo and Zook soils are in positions similar to the Excello soils. Typically, the Fatima, Kennebec, Nodaway and Tice soils are on slightly higher elevations than the Excello soils. In upland drainageways Vigar and Zook soils are common associates upslope from the Excello soils."
