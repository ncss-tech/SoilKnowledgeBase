  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Excello soils are on nearly level or very gently sloping flood plains, gently sloping alluvial fans, and concave toeslopes. These are the lower parts of gently sloping upland drainageways near the water course. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 34 to 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  On flood plains and alluvial fans, these include the Beaucoup, Blackoar, Colo, Fatima, Kennebec, Tice, Vigar, Zook and Nodaway soils. Beaucoup, Blackoar, Colo, Fatima, Kennebec, Nodaway and Tice soils are fine-silty. Vigar soils have an argillic horizon. Zook soils are fine. Beaucoup, Blackoar, Colo and Zook soils are in positions similar to the Excello soils. Typically, the Fatima, Kennebec, Nodaway and Tice soils are on slightly higher elevations than the Excello soils. In upland drainageways Vigar and Zook soils are common associates upslope from the Excello soils."

In undisturbed areas the watertable is at depths of 0 to 1.5 feet for some time in most years. In other areas the upper depth of an apparent water table is at 1.0 to 3.0 feet during November to May. Flooding is rare to common."
