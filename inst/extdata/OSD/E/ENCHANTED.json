  "OVERVIEW": "The Enchanted series consists of moderately deep or deep, well drained soils on mountain side slopes and ridge tops. These soils formed in till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high in the organic surface layer, moderately high or high in the mineral solum, and high or very high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 15 to 80 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 1 degree C, and mean annual precipitation is about 127 centimeters at the type location.",

The Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock on convex positions. Mahoosuc soils are deep and very deep soils comprized of thin organic materials overlying fragmental colluvium or till and are on similar positions in the landscape. Saddleback soils are on convex positions and are shallow to bedrock. Sisk soils are very deep, well drained soils on smooth side slopes generally less sloping than Enchanted soils. Surplus soils are very deep, wetter soils on lower side slopes generally less sloping than Enchanted soils."
