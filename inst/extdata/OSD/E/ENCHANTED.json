    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are principally the Ricker soils and to a lesser extent, Mahoosuc, Saddleback, Sisk and Surplus soils. The Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock on convex positions. Mahoosuc soils are deep and very deep soils comprized of thin organic materials overlying fragmental colluvium or till and are on similar positions in the landscape. Saddleback soils are on convex positions and are shallow to bedrock. Sisk soils are very deep, well drained soils on smooth side slopes generally less sloping than Enchanted soils. Surplus soils are very deep, wetter soils on lower side slopes generally less sloping than Enchanted soils."
