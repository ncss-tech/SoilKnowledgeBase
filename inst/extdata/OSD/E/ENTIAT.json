  "OVERVIEW": "The Entiat series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rock, loess, and volcanic ash. Entiat soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section contains 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments by weighted average, and is loam or sandy loam.  A small amount of pumice and volcanic ash is in the profile.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak fine subangular blocky, weak thin platy, or weak fine granular structure.  It is gravelly fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is gravelly fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  It contains 30 to 50 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  This horizon contains 40 to 60 percent gravel and a few cobbles.  Some pedons have C horizons.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  It has less than one percent organic matter."
