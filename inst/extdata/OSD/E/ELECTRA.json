    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cassia, Narcoossee, Newnan, Pomello, and Zolfo soils.  Cassia, Narcoossee, Pomello, and Zolfo soils do not have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizon.  Newnan soils have a spodic horizon between depths of 50 and 80 inches.  In addition, Cassia soils have a spodic horizon at depths of less than 30 inches, and Zolfo soils have a spodic horizons at depths greater than 50 inches."

Adamsville, Candler, and Tavares soils are on higher ridges and lack spodic and argillic horizons.  Myakka soils are poorly drained, lack argillic horizons, and the spodic horizon is within depths of 30 inches.  Pompano soils are on lower elevations and lack a spodic horizon."

Permeability is rapid in the A and E horizons and moderate in the Bh horizon and slow to very slow in the Bt horizon.  The water table is at depths of 25 to 40 inches for cumulative periods of 2 to 4 months during most years and recedes to depths of more than 40 inches during drier periods."

Most areas remain in native vegetation consisting of dwarf live oak, a few longleaf and sand pine, running oak, sawpalmetto, and blueberry.  Creeping bluestem, chalky bluestem, lopsided indiangrass, low panicum, pineland threeawn, paspalum, and numerous forbs dominate the understory."
