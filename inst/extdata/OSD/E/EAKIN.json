  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate typically is about 13 inches but ranges from 10 to 18 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  The thickness of the silty mantle overlying the glacial till typically is about 28 inches thick but ranges from 20 to 40 inches; the solum rests on or extends into the glacial till.  The solum ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the noncalcareous part and from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the remainder of the solum and C horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It averages between 27 and 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are loam or clay loam with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Relic mottles, fragments of shale, small pebbles, and nests of gypsum crystals are in some pedons."

The Agar, Highmore and Holdrege soils do not have horizons with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser above 40 inches.  The Fairlo soils are underlain by clayey sediments.  The Monticello and Northdale soils have redder hue.  The Paka soils have soft siltstone at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

Agar soils are intermingled in areas where the silty mantle is loess.  DeGrey, Highmore, and Walke soils are intermingled mainly on nearly level landscapes.  Highmore soils do not have glacial till within a depths of 40 inches.  The fine-loamy Glenham soils and the fine textured Raber soils are intermingled where the silty mantle is thinly deposited over glacial till.  DeGrey and Walke soils have natric horizons. Mobridge and Onita soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and are in swales and drainageways."
