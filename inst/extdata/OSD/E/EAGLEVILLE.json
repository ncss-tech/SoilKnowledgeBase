The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe Ap and A horizon, and the AB or BA horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay in the Ap, A, and AB horizons, and is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam in the BA horizon.\nThe Bg horizon and BCg or CBg horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features are few to common in shades of brown, black, and gray.  Texture is silty clay, clay, or rarely silty clay loam.\nThe Cg or 2Cg horizon has the same range in colors and textures as the Bg horizon or is an evenly mottled pattern and lacks a dominant color."
