  "OVERVIEW": "The Elfkin series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium from loess and volcanic ash over basalt bedrock.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent on lava plains and valleys.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm inches and the average annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

As revised in 2010, Elijah soils must be greater than 150 cm to bedrock.  Bedrock substratum phases of Elijah in Ada County Area, Canyon County Area, and Wood River Area soil surveys (Idaho) will be correlated to the Elfkin Series during MLRA updates."
