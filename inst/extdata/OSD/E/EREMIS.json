  "OVERVIEW": "The Eremis series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from welded tuff and rhyolite bedrock.  These soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretive record: MT1747.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from 1 to 7 inches (A and upper part of the Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 3 to 25 inches (Bw and BC horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, BC and C horizons).  Eremis soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Ashy, glassy Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified."
