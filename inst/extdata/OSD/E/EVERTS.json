  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 48 inches in thickness and has fine strata. Depth to free carbonates is 24 to 80 inches or more. The depth to coarse textured material ranges from  40 to 55 inches.  The control section has more than 18 to 24 percent clay and from 30 to about 65 percent fine sand and coarser. Pedons commonly are free of rock fragments in the loamy mantle but may have as much as 5 percent, by volume.  The volume of rock fragments in the C horizon ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Some pedons have an accumulation of clay in the subsoil but have less than a 1.2 B/A clay ratio.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. It is typically loam or sandy loam but includes silt loam in some pedons. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loam or sandy loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand and their gravelly analogues. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping foot slopes or toe slopes on outwash plains, stream terraces and collapsed outwash in morainic areas.. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils  formed in loamy colluvial sediments overlying coarse textured outwash sediment.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 29 inches. The frost-free days range from 120 to 160 days. Elevation above sea level is 990 to 1950 feet."

Often the color of the upper sediment is lighter than the original surface due to deposition; udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
