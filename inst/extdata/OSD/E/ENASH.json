  "OVERVIEW": "The Enash series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from tuff.  These moderate sloping soils are on mountain bases.  Slope ranges from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
