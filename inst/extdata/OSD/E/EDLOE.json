    "content": "SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, 2010.  The name is taken from a small store in Teller County.  The 02/2010 revision re-activates and re-describes the formerly inactive Edloe series. The original Edloe series was proposed in 1943 and established in 1959 with a type location on the Manitou Experimental Forest, Teller County. The classification was fine-loamy mixed Typic Cryoboralfs. This series was not recognized in a current soil survey, and was inactivated in 2009. A very similar soil was recognized in the Teller-Park soil survey, and the Edloe series name was reactivated and used for the series proposed in the Teller-Park Area."
