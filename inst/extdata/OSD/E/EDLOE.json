  "OVERVIEW": "The Edloe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from granite, gneiss, or monzonite.  Edloe soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 20 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The 02/2010 revision re-activates and re-describes the formerly inactive Edloe series. The original Edloe series was proposed in 1943 and established in 1959 with a type location on the Manitou Experimental Forest, Teller County. The classification was fine-loamy mixed Typic Cryoboralfs. This series was not recognized in a current soil survey, and was inactivated in 2009. A very similar soil was recognized in the Teller-Park soil survey, and the Edloe series name was reactivated and used for the series proposed in the Teller-Park Area."
