Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2.  Content of rock fragments range from 10 to 40 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2. Content of rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3.  Texture is loamy sand.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of unconsolidated andesite rock.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard consolidated basic andesite bedrock."
