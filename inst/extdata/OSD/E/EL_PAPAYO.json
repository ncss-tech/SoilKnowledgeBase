  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The El Papayo series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on ridge tops, summits, and side slopes of the volcanic hills of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in residuum and colluvium that weathered from basic volcanic rock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.",

Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2.  Content of rock fragments range from 10 to 40 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2. Content of rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3.  Texture is loamy sand.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of unconsolidated andesite rock.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard consolidated basic andesite bedrock."
