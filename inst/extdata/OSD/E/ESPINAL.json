  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Espinal series consists of deep, excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils.  They formed in sand-sized, shell fragments, quartz grains and volcanic fragments.  These nearly level soils are on beaches and terraces in coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Espinal series occur on nearly level terrain along the coast at elevation close to sea level.  The regolith consists of quartz grains, shell fragments, and miscellaneous sand-size volcanic subrounded fragments.  The climate is tropical humid.  The average annual precipitation is 65 inches and mean annual temperature of 77 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches depth is 72 degrees F. or more and the difference between mean summer and winter temperatures is less than 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and are not dry in any subhorizon from 7 to 20 inches for as much as 60 consecutive or 90 cumulative days in most years."
