It ranges from silt loam to fine sandy loam, and is medium acid to neutral.  A horizon 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches thick of silty clay loam with redder hue occurs in some pedons immediately above the lithic contact in areas where free water may migrate for long periods during the wet season."

They are in a semiarid to dry subhumid mesothermal climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., average July temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F., average annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is more than 240 days."

Fallbrook soils have reddish brown, medium textured argillic horizons. Las Posas soils have dark red, fine textured argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  San Miguel soils have intermittent, strongly acid albic horizons, and strongly acid, fine textured argillic horizons. Twin Oaks soils have reddish brown, fine textured argillic horizons, and may be high in exchangeable sodium."
