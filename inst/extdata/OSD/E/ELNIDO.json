The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rocks. Most of this soil has been land leveled, but the natural landscape had bar and channel topography. Elevationis 75 to 170 feet. Climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Themean annual temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F.

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; negligible or very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability. Some pedons have very rapid permeability in the lower part of the profile. In clay loam phases permeability is moderately slow in the surface and moderately rapid below. In most areas of Elnido soils the natural hydrology has been altered so that the soils are now considered to be drained. The presence of dams and reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada, pumping from the water table, use of tile and interceptor drains, filling of local sloughs and leveling of bar and channel topography help explain the altered hydrology. Prior to the altered hydrology Elnido soils were subject to occasional flooding with long duration from January through March, consequently, the native soils were very poorly drained having ponded channels with stagnant water for extended periods during the winter and spring months. Currently, depth to the water table is generally greater than 3.5 feet. Most areas are protected from major flooding by levees and reservoirs. Some areas are subject to rare, brief periods of flooding from December through June in years of abnormally high precipitation. In areas unprotected by levees, flooding is occasional or frequent."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with and surveyed as Grangeville series in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report. They are being differentiated by characteristics that show a reducing environment (Aquic moisture regime) which is not characteristic of the Grangeville series. The pH was determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators. Texture was determined by modified Bouyoucos method.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.\nVery slow runoff terminology adjusted 12/96 to negligible or very low, to comply with adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual dated 10/93.\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons and Features:\n1. Mollic Epipedon --The zone from 0 to 18 inches (Ap,A) - Organic matter is assumed to be 1 to 3 percent and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent below 10 inches.  The thickness is 10 to 22 inches.\n2. Aquic moisture regime - Formed under aquic conditions with most areas now drained and protected.  Still, many areas will have the entire profile saturated for a short period of time by the water table and stagnant surface water.\n3. Coarse-loamy family - Clay content of the particle-size control section (10 to 40 inches) is 5 to 18 percent but averages 8 to 16 percent(Hydrometer method).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
