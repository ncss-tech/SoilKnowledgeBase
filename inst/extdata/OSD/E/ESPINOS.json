  "OVERVIEW": "The Espinos series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and slope alluvium over residuum derived from extrusive igneous rocks. Espinos soils are on beveled summits, shoulders, and backslopes of low hills. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
