  "OVERVIEW": "The Ela series consists of poorly and very poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on flood plains in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). These soils formed in recent alluvium consisting of loamy material that is moderately deep to strata of gravel, and/or cobbles. The elevation ranges from 1,800 to 4,000 feet. Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 62 inches. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.",

Rock fragments are mainly gravel and cobble size and well rounded.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Dry value is less than 5. Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nWhere present, the AC horizon is similar in color to the A horizon. Texture in the fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam .\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture in the fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture in the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.

Flooding is occasional to frequent but of very brief or extremely brief duration. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in recent alluvium consisting of loamy material that is moderately deep to strata of sand, gravel, and/or cobbles. Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches."

All but the Thurmont and Whiteside series occur on floodplains. Bandana and Cullowhee soils are somewhat poorly drained. Dellwood and Reddies soils are moderately well drained. French soils are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained. Smokemont soils are well drained. Toxaway soils are in a fine-loamy particle-size class and have an umbric epipedon 24 or more inches thick. Wesser soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class. Thurmont soils are oxyaquic and Whiteside soils are moderately well drained and are on adjacent toe slopes."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Pasture and hay land are the main agricultural uses. Although most areas have been cleared, crop production is severely limited due to wetness and flooding. As a result, many areas are now idle and commonly vegetated with alders, sedges, rushes, and broadleaf species. Common trees in forested areas are yellow poplar, hawthorns, hemlock, winterberry, sycamore, red maple, and river birch."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The soils now placed in the Ela series were previously included in the Nikwasi series and were identified as a minor component or correlated as a taxadjunct to the Nikwasi series. However, as a result of additional field data collection and mapping in survey areas within the MLRA, the Ela series is found to be of wider extent.\nSiliceous mineralogy family placement is based on lab data from the two sampled pedons listed below. However, mineralogy of individual pedons may vary with the characteristics of the alluvium within that watershed.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) were to correct formatting problems in the OSD.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nUmbric Epipedon - The zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 16 inches (A horizon)\nAquic conditions evidence of endosaturation as indicated by redoximorphic features such as a reduced matrix (chroma of 2 or less) and presence of redox concentrations and depletions.\nContrasting particle-size classes within 20 to 40 inches Cg and 2Cg horizons."
