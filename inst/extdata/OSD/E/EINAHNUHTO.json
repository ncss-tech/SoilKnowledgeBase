  "OVERVIEW": "The Einahnuhto series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in basalt with an admixture, near the surface, of eolian material derived from volcanic pyroclastics.  Einahnuhto soils are on dipslopes and wide valley bottoms.  Permeability is moderately slow to moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic layers and features recognized in this profile include an ochric epipedon and a cambic horizon.  A base saturation of 60 percent or more in one horizon between 10 and 30 inches from the mineral surface.  Base saturation tends to increase with depth.  primarily due to eolian additions a layer or layers within 30 inches of the mineral surface that is between 7 and 15 inches thick and has a fine earth fraction containing 30 percent or more coarse silt to sand, at least 5 percent volcanic glass, and aluminum + 1/2 iron content extracted by ammonium oxalate times 60 plus the volcanic glass content equal to or greater than 30.  More than 1/2 the thickness of the mineralogy control section has a NaF pH of 8.4 or more and a ratio of 1500 kPa water retention to clay content greater than 0.6.  A lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches depth and a cryic temperature regime.  The weighted average particle size in the control section is silty clay loam."
