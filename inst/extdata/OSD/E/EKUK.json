  "OVERVIEW": "The Ekuk series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in loess over fluviomarine deposits on rises of coastal plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.",

Alflack, Dagget, Freelpeak, Graylock, Ragamuffin, Stecum, and Whittell are moderately deep to deep soils formed in residuum or colluvium on mountain slopes with slope gradients that range up to 20 to 75 percent. Castlepeak, Chena, and Eklutna are all excessively drained soils formed in alluvium and/or glacial outwash. Cryomont, Nataga, and Nizina all are formed in alluvium and have slopes that range up to 20 to 40 percent. Canlordore is a well drained soil formed in glacial deposits on mountainsides with slopes from 15 to 40 percent. Perfecto and Sofgran are mountain slope soils formed in colluvium, residuum, or slope alluvium with slopes that range from 8 to 65 percent.  Obscurity is formed in mud flow material and Studebaker is formed in avalanche debris."
