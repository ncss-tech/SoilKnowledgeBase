  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is greater than 80 inches thick.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in all layers.  Texture is sand or fine sand throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3, or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 4.  Few to common yellow, brown, or strong brown mottles may occur in the E horizon as do few to common uncoated sand grains.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Sand grains are weakly coated with organic matter.  However, the horizon does not meet the requirements of a spodic horizon.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Sand grains are well coated with colloidal organic matter."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Centenary and Rimini series in the same family.  Centenary soils have mottles indicative of wetness above a depth of 60 inches.  Rimini soils have an E horizon with chroma of 2 or less.  Also competing is the Cainhoy series which differs by having a Bh horizon below a depth of 80 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eglin soils are on nearly level to gently sloping broad upland landscapes on relatively low elevations within the sand hills commonly near the heads of drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 65 to 70 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Cainhoy series and the Blanton, Chipley, Foxworth, Hurricane, Lakeland, Leon and Rutlege series.  Blanton soils have an argillic horizon.  Chipley, Foxworth, and Lakeland soils do not have spodic horizons.  Hurricane soils have a seasonally high water table above a depth of 40 inches.  Leon soils have a high water table and spodic horizon within a depth of 30 inches. Rutlege soils have a high water table near the soil surface for long periods and have an umbric epipedon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  The water table is at a depth below 72 inches for most of the year.  The water table fluctuates briefly between depths of 60 to 80 inches during periods of high rainfall. Runoff is low.  Permeability is rapid in the surface and subsurface layer and moderate to moderately rapid in the subsoil."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

Eglin soils are used mainly for forest."

(A, E1, E2, E3)\nSpodic horizon - zone from 68 inches to 80 inches. (Bh1, Bh2)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
