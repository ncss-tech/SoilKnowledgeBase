  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches or more.  Coarse fragments are mostly rounded siliceous pebbles and few cobbles range from 35 to 80 percent by volume in all horizons.\nThe A and E horizons are very gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly loamy sand.  They are slightly acid through strongly acid.  The A horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3) or light brown (7.5YR 6/4).  The E horizon is very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 8/4), light brown (7.5YR 6/4) or pink (7.5YR 7/4).\nThe Bt horizons are light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1) or white (10YR 8/1, 8/2) mottles in shades of red, brown and other shades of gray.  In some pedons the matrix is red or yellowish brown, mottled in shades of gray.  Plinthite makes up 0 to 15 percent by volume of the Bt horizons.  The Bt horizons are very gravelly or gravelly sandy clay loam, with an average clay content of the fine earth fraction ranging from 20 to 35 percent.  They are strongly acid through extremely acid.  Some pedons have loamy BC horizons, prominently mottled in shades of red, yellow and gray.  Base saturation of the Bt horizons ranges from 35 to 60 percent by sum of cations."

The soil formed in ancient stream terrace or delta deposits of sand and gravel mainly associated with Citronelle geology.  Mean annual temperature is 70 to 72 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 32 to 43 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 42 to 64."

Tremona soils have less than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments in the Bt horizon."
