  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and loamy mantle and depth to sandy residuum from sandstone are in the range of 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments comprise 0 to 5 percent of the loamy mantle and 2 to 35 percent of the horizons in the sandy residuum.  The fragments are mostly sandstone.  The sandy residuum is typically acid but has free carbonates in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  The control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam high in content of sand.  It is medium acid through neutral.  The BA or AB horizons are not in all pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  It has a few faint clay films on faces of peds in some pedons.  It is very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sand, fine sand or loamy sand.  It is very strongly acid through moderately alkaline.\nA 2Cr horizon of sandstone begins at depths as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons."

All of these soils except Bertram lack 2B and 2C horizons in residuum from sandstone within depths of 40 inches.  Bertram soils have an R horizon of limestone bedrock at a depth of less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Etter soils have plane, concave, or slightly convex slopes on rock-cored terraces or structural benches and in uplands.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in a mantle of loamy glacial drift, erosional sediments, or mixed loess and erosional sediments that are 20 to 40 inches thick and are underlain by sandy residuum from sandstone bedrock.  Mean annual temperature is 44 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 25 to 34 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brodale, Eyota, and Faxon soils.  Well drained Brodale soils are loamy-skeletal, are upslope from Etter soils, and formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone.  Well drained Eyota soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are downslope from Etter soils.  Poorly drained Faxon soils are downslope and have a lithic contact within depths of 40 inches."
