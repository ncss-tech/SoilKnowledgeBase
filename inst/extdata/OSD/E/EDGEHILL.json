    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 30 to 60 or more inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Clay content in the control section ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  Coarse fragments in the control section exceed 35 percent and range to about 70\npercent.  These consist of rounded quartz, quartzite and gneiss gravel and cobblestones.  Few to common flakes of mica are in\nsome pedons.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid,\nunless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of\n1 through 3.  The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR,\nvalue of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6\nand chroma of 4 through 8.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  The lower Bt horizon includes hue of\n10R.  It is clay loam or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon if present is similar in color to the Bt horizon.\nIt is sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is highly variable with regard to color, texture and rock fragment content."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Honobia series is the only series in the\nsame family.  The Conotton, Lillington, and Saffell series are in related families.  Honobia soils are dominated with shale\nfragments and the solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  All the related soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Conotton soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent; and the Lillington, and Saffell soils have siliceous mineralogy."

They developed in old, very gravelly alluvium.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."
