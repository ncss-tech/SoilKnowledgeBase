    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to\n60 inches.  The A and E horizons are loamy fine sand or fine\nsand and are slightly acid through very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma\nof 2 or 3.  The E horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to\n7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles, where present, range from\nfaint to distinct and are brown and yellow.\nSome pedons have thin BE or Bw horizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma\nof 1 or 2.  Texture is clay or sandy clay.  Mottles are\nyellow, brown, strong brown, reddish brown, or red.  The Bt\nhorizons range from medium acid to extremely acid.  In some\npedons a few siliceous pebbles are present and are mostly concentrated at the top of the Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have BC horizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe Cr layer ranges from weakly to strongly cemented\nsandstone to tuffaceous clays with rock structure."

Depcor soils have loamy control\nsections and siliceous mineralogy.  Gomery, Larue, Rimer,\nand Wolfpen soils have fine-loamy control sections. In\naddition, Gomery soils have less than 35 percent base\nsaturation; Larue and Wolfpen soils have siliceous\nmineralogy; and Rimer soils have mean annual soil\ntemperatures of less than 59 degrees F.

The soil formed in sandy and\nclayey deposits containing volcanic materials.  The climate\nis subhumid.  The average annual temperature is 67 degrees\nto 70 degrees F.  At the type location, the mean annual\nprecipitation is about 44 inches and the Thornthwaite annual\nP-E index is about 70."
