The A and E horizons are loamy fine sand or fine\nsand and are slightly acid through very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma\nof 2 or 3.  The E horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to\n7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles, where present, range from\nfaint to distinct and are brown and yellow.\nSome pedons have thin BE or Bw horizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma\nof 1 or 2.  Texture is clay or sandy clay.  Mottles are\nyellow, brown, strong brown, reddish brown, or red.  The Bt\nhorizons range from medium acid to extremely acid.  In some\npedons a few siliceous pebbles are present and are mostly concentrated at the top of the Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have BC horizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe Cr layer ranges from weakly to strongly cemented\nsandstone to tuffaceous clays with rock structure."
