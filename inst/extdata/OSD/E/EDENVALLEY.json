  "OVERVIEW": "The Edenvalley series consists of moderately deep to fractured hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks dominantly on dissected mountain slopes and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 100 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry less 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic soil moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume, and 20 to 50 percent sand.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 6 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 30 to 50 percent for air dried samples, and acid oxalate iron is 0.5 to 1.5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter.  It has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial silt loam, extremely cobbly medial silt loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent organic matter.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum."
