  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkinsville series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or silty sediments and the underlying loamy alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Cidermill soils typically have more than 14 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section but the range does overlap with Elkinsville series. Olephant, Parke ,and Pike soils are deeper than 183 cm (72 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Wellrock soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Wellston soils have rock fragments of siltstone or sandstone lithology in the lower part of the series control section."

The moderately well drained Pekin and well drained, fine-loamy Millstone soils are on treads and risers. The poorly drained Vincennes soils are on treads and on flood-plain steps. The well drained Wheeling soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is being differentiated from the Elk series based on the amount of sand in the lower part of the series control section. Some of the Elkinsville soils previously correlated will likely be re-correlated to the Elk series because the sand content is less than 35 percent in the lower part of the series control section.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface of the soil to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from 23 to 147 cm (9 to 58 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5 horizons).\nRepresentative component and horizon data is in DMU# 120,077."
