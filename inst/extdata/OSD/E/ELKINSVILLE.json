    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bearthicket, Cidermill, Elk, Olephant, Parke, Pike, Rickert, Tobinsport, Wellrock, and Wellston series. Bearthicket, Elk and Rickert soils have less than 35 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Cidermill soils typically have more than 14 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section but the range does overlap with Elkinsville series. Olephant, Parke ,and Pike soils are deeper than 183 cm (72 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Wellrock soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Wellston soils have rock fragments of siltstone or sandstone lithology in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Elkinsville soils are on stream terraces or flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or silty sediments and the underlying loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 210 days. Elevation is 104 to 244 meters (340 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are primarily the Bartle, Millstone, Pekin, and Peoga soils on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. They are also associated with the Vincennes and Wheeling soils on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. The somewhat poorly drained Bartle and the poorly drained Peoga soils are on treads. The moderately well drained Pekin and well drained, fine-loamy Millstone soils are on treads and risers. The poorly drained Vincennes soils are on treads and on flood-plain steps. The well drained Wheeling soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is being differentiated from the Elk series based on the amount of sand in the lower part of the series control section. Some of the Elkinsville soils previously correlated will likely be re-correlated to the Elk series because the sand content is less than 35 percent in the lower part of the series control section.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface of the soil to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from 23 to 147 cm (9 to 58 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5 horizons).\nRepresentative component and horizon data is in DMU# 120,077.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, Station Bulletin No. 323, file no's. JF7916, PK7905, RI8001 (typical pedon); NSSL, Lincoln, NE: S93IN123-15.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
