  "OVERVIEW": "The Evanot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Evanot soils are on hills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
