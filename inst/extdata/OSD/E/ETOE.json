    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The annual soil temperature is 40 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is 47 degrees to 50 degrees F. The solum is 60 to 90 inches thick. Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Rock fragments are angular pebbles, cobbles, and stones of sandstone. Rock fragments in the A horizon range from 0 to 60 percent, in the mixed horizons from 20 to 65 percent, and in the B horizons from 50 to 85 percent. Some pedons have a thin A1 horizon.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe mixed horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist. They are loam, sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam. These horizons have weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist. It is heavy sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam and has 10 to 25 percent clay and more than 45 percent sand."

Angostura, Coldcreek, Cundiyo, Gambler, Jorge, Lake Creek, Tecolote and Yourame soils have argillic horizons whose upper boundary is shallower than 24 inches. Bundo soils have argillic horizons whose upper boundary is deeper than 45 inches. Marosa soils lack A&B and B&A horizons. Tigeron soils are strongly or medium acid."

The soils formed in colluvial-alluvial material from sandstone and shale of the Magdalena formation. The climate is continental. The average annual temperature is 38 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 45 degrees to 48 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches, about 75 percent falling during the frost-free season. THe frost-free season is less than 90 days."
