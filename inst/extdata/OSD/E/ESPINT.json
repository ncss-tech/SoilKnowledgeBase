    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bedzee, Brisbois, Chalco, Gumble and Xman series.\nAll of these soils are moist for less than 10 days in the summer. Brisbois soils have carbonate coats on rock fragments or masses. Bedzee soils contain 40 to 60 percent clay and are moist 10 to 20 day during the summer months. Chalco soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Gumble soils are 36 to 50 cm to soft rock. Xman soils are slightly acid or neutral, and have hard bedrock within 100 cm."

Elevations are 1,680 to 2,135 meters. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
