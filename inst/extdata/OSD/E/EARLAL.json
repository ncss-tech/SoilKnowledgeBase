  "OVERVIEW": "The Earlal series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from serpentinized ultramafic rocks.  Earlal soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on ultramafic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches, (1321 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, (14 degrees C).",
