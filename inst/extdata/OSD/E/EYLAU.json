    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ardilla, Atlee, Cedarbluff, and Swafford series in the same family, and the Blevins, Bowie, Cane, Carnegie, Cowarts, Kullit, Ora, Savannah, and Sawyer series in closely related families. Ardilla, Bowie, Carnegie, and Cowarts soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite in the Bt horizon. In addition, Carnegie soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Blevins soils do not have fragic properties in the Bt horizon and do not have gray iron depletions within 30 inches of the surface. Atlee and Swafford soils do not have a glossic horizon. Cane, Ora, and Savannah soils have over 60 percent brittle peds in the Bt horizons. In addition, Cane and Ora soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Cedarbluff soils have slightly poorer drainage and do not have a glossic horizon. Kullit and Sawyer soils do not have fragic properties in the Bt horizon, and have over 35 percent clay in the lower Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eylau soils are on broad ridges. They formed in loamy Coastal Plains sediments mostly of Tertiary Age. Slopes are generally 1 to 2 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 68 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64 inches"

Annona soils have dark red clayey Bt horizons. Blevins and Ruston soils are in slightly higher better drained postions. Ruston soils are redder throughout. Sawyer soils are lower in the landscape in less well drained positions. Adaton and Wrightsville soils are in nearby flat, poorly drained positions and are dominated by gray colors. Sacul soils occur on short slopes and have a clayey Bt horizon."

The series was updated in 2004 to allow albic intrusions to also occur in the upper part of the Bt horizon, and to allow a Bt' horizon in the lower part of the solum. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon.....0 to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nGlossic horizon....55 to 80 inches (Bt/E horizon).\nArgillic horizon...12 to 80 inches (Bt and Bt/E horizons).\nFragic properties..36 to 55 inches (Btx horizon).\nAquic conditions...12 to 22 inches (Bt1 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
