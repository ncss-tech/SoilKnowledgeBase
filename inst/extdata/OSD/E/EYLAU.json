  "OVERVIEW": "The Eylau series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in thick loamy Coastal Plain sediments on uplands. These gently sloping soils are on moderately long, slightly convex slopes and ridges. They have a perched water table 2 to 3 feet below the surface from February to May. Slopes are dominantly 1 to 2 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Ardilla, Bowie, Carnegie, and Cowarts soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite in the Bt horizon. In addition, Carnegie soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Blevins soils do not have fragic properties in the Bt horizon and do not have gray iron depletions within 30 inches of the surface. Atlee and Swafford soils do not have a glossic horizon. Cane, Ora, and Savannah soils have over 60 percent brittle peds in the Bt horizons. In addition, Cane and Ora soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Cedarbluff soils have slightly poorer drainage and do not have a glossic horizon. Kullit and Sawyer soils do not have fragic properties in the Bt horizon, and have over 35 percent clay in the lower Bt horizon."

Sawyer soils are lower in the landscape in less well drained positions. Adaton and Wrightsville soils are in nearby flat, poorly drained positions and are dominated by gray colors. Sacul soils occur on short slopes and have a clayey Bt horizon."
