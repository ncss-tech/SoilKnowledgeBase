  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the bedrock and paralithic contact is typically about 28 to 35 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 32 inches thick and typically includes the upper part of the Bt horizon. These soils are noncalcareous throughout. The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent small channers throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 but more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

The Bachus, Benteen, Cambern, Harmehl, Senchert, Vadnais, Winn, and Winu soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. The Bavdark, Crystalbutt, Davtone, Clayburn, Decross, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Pontuge, Southmount, and Thulepah soils are more than 40 inches deep. Gordo soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the Bt horizon. Stubbs soils contain free carbonates in the lower strata. Squawval soils are 45 to 70 percent sand in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Echemoor soils are on mountain footslopes and lower hillslopes contiguous to mountain fronts. They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from noncalcareous sedimentary rock. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 7,000 to 9,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and ranges from 15 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. and ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 60 to 90 days."
