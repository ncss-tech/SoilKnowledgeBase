  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon, typically is 15 to 20 inches and ranges from 8 to 24 inches.  The depth to salt accumulations typically is about 4 to 7 inches, but many pedons have salts at the surface.  Conductivity typically is 16 or more mmhos/cm and ranges from 8 to more than 50.  When the surface is dry, visible crusts of salt are common on many pedons.  Carbonate typically is with salt accumulations, but some pedons have horizons with salt accumulations above horizons that contain carbonate.  Depth to carbonate ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Some pedons have gypsum crystals in the solum and C horizons.  The control section typically averages about 45 percent clay and contains more than 10 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a surface crust of silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe ACz horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Some pedons have few or common distinct redox features throughout.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is silty clay but is silty clay loam, clay loam or clay in some pedons.  It has few to many, distinct or prominent redox features, but some pedons do not have redox features.  Thin strata of coarser textured materials are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Durrstein soils have a natric horizon and are on similar landscapes.  The Bon, Betts, Java and Ree soils have a fine-loamy series control section.  The well drained and moderately well drained Bon soils are on slightly higher parts of the flood plain.  The well drained Betts and Java soils are on higher upland landscapes.  The well drained Ree soils are on higher terraces."
