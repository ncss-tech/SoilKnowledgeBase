The well-drained Binnsville and Demopolis soil are on narrow ridge tops and hill sides and are shallow to limestone. In addition, Binnsville soils have a mollic epipedon and Demopolis soils are in a loamy-skeletal carbonatic family. The somewhat poorly drained Kipling and poorly drained Mayhew soils are on similar to lower, more rolling positions and have less clay in the control section. In addition, Mayhew soils are underlain by acid clays. The moderately well drained Oktibbeha soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have redder upper subsoils. The well-drained Sumter soils are on adjacent hill sides and ridge tops, have fine-silty control sections and are moderately deep to limestone. The somewhat poorly drained Vaiden soils are on slightly higher positions and have yellower upper subsoils."
