  "OVERVIEW": "The Endlich series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium from granite, breccia, rhyolite, andesite, or tuff.  Endlich soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
