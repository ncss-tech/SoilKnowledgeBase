  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the petrocalcic horizon ranges from 4 to 16 inches.  The coarse fragment content of caliche and limestone fragments in the control section ranges from 35 to about 75 percent by volume. Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from 10 to 40 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fraction less than 2 cm ranges from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The fine earth fraction is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam with a clay content of 20 to 40 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 45 percent in the A horizon and from 50 to 80 percent in the Ak horizon.\nThe Bkm horizon has colors in shades of white, pink or brown.  The upper 3 cm or less of the Bkm is laminar and cementation ranges from strong to indurated, Moh's hardness of 3 to 5.\nThe Crk horizon, where present, is platy, brittle marly earth and soft limestone bedrock or massive caliche.\nThe Cr layer consists of beds of very pale brown, chalky limestone bedrock, marl, or light gray limestone bedrock that can be chipped or dug with a spade and backhoe.  Some pedons are strongly cemented in the upper part and weakly cemented and massive below.  Layers of limestone are mostly less than 20 cm thick.  Hard limestone layers are present below 40 inches in some pedons."

Amistad soils have hard limestone immediately underlying the petrocalcic horizon.  The Boracho and Noelke soils contain less than 50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section.  Cho, Kavett and Mereta contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Lueders, Oplin, Talpa and Tarrant soils lack petrocalcic horizons and are underlain by hard limestone within 20 inches.  Olmos and Zorra soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F.  Pitzer soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments and less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Real soils have precipitation from 26 to 32 inches, PE zone of more than 38 and formed in Glen Rose Marl."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS:  Eola soils are on undulating uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in beds of calcareous sediments consisting of marls and soft limestone, mostly of the Lower Cretaceous System.  The climate is dry subhumid with mean annual precipitation of 20 to 26 inches and Thornthwaite annual P-E indicates are about 32 to 38.  Mean annual air temperature varies from 65 to 70 degrees F.  Elevation near the type location ranges from about 2,000 to 2,400 feet. Frost-free days range from 220 to 240 days."

Nuvalde, Rowena and Tobosa soils are deep soils that occur in valleys or concave areas.  Cho and Mereta soils occur on ridgetops above Eola soils.  Kavett, Oplin, Real and Tarrant soils occur at lower elevations and grow significant amounts of trees and shrubs."
