(0 to 6 inches thick)\nThe Bw horizon when present has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. The Bw horizon typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations and depletions. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam or silt loam. This horizon has redoximorphic features in most pedons. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3BCd horizon has a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 cm (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 38 cm (Bw horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 38 to 127 cm (2Bt horizons); Epi saturation - based on restricted saturated hydraulic conductivity at the densic contact; densic contact -  152 cm (3BCd horizon)\nThe designation of the 3BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nThis reddish parent material does not show low chroma colors typical of reducing conditions."
