    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mantle and depth to fine loamy till ranges from 0 to 41 cm. The depth to dense till ranges from 152 to 203 cm.  Depth to free carbonates is greater than 203 cm. Volume of rock fragments throughout the upper mantle and fine loamy till ranges from 1 to 12 percent with 1 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 1 percent cobbles and 0 to 1 percent stones and boulders. Rock fragment content in the dense till ranges from 8 to 25 percent with 8 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders.  The mantle averages less than 18 percent clay. The argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 25 percent clay. The fine-loamy till ranges from 16 to 22 percent clay and contains less than 45 percent sand. The dense till ranges from 3 to 10 percent clay and contains less than 72 percent sand.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 2.  Dry color has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E, E/B or B/E horizon that does not meet the criteria for a glossic horizon. The E has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bt has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid. (0 to 6 inches thick)\nThe Bw horizon when present has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. The Bw horizon typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations and depletions. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam or silt loam. This horizon has redoximorphic features in most pedons. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3BCd horizon has a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 8 to 25 percent with 8 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders. It is moderately acid to neutral."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plain or concave slopes of 0 to 1 percent on moraines. This soil formed in a mantle of eolian or water laid sediments and the underlying friable till and the underlying dense till. The till is from the Superior Lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 750 mm. The frost free season ranges from 120 to 140 days. The elevation ranges from 300 to 500 meters above sea level."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 cm (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 38 cm (Bw horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 38 to 127 cm (2Bt horizons); Epi saturation - based on restricted saturated hydraulic conductivity at the densic contact; densic contact -  152 cm (3BCd horizon)\nThe designation of the 3BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nThis reddish parent material does not show low chroma colors typical of reducing conditions.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
