  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Calcium carbonates are typically at the surface, but some pedons in native grass are leached to 5 inches.  The calcic horizon has a calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from 15 to 35 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.  The particle size control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and contains up to 5 percent pebbles by volume.  Some pedons contain up to 35 percent by volume of stones.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is loam or clay loam but is silt loam or gravelly loam in some pedons.  In areas mantled by sandy sediments, it is loamy fine sand or sandy loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It typically has few to many masses of calcium carbonate.\nThe C horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam or clay loam, but in some pedons it is stratified loam, clay loam, silt loam, and fine sandy loam.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline and has few to many masses of calcium carbonate.  It has mottles inherent to the parent material and masses of gypsum in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ethan soils are on upland till plains. Slopes typically are short and irregular and surfaces are convex.  Slope gradient ranges from 1 to 40 percent.  These soils typically formed in calcareous loam and clay loam glacial till and some silty glacial materials.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 150 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches; and average growing degree days are about 2800 to 3300."

Betts soils are on similar landscapes and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Bonilla and Prosper soils are in swales and have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Clarno, Egan, Eakin, Hand, Homme, and Houdek soils are leached of carbonates to depths of more than 5 inches and are on similar but less sloping landscapes. In addition, they typically are below areas of Ethan soils.  Davison soils are on slight rises adjacent to depressed drainageways and closed depressions and have redoximorphic features within 30 inches."
