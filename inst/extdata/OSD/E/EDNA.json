  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification was changed from Vertic Albaqualfs to Vertic Hapludalfs based on the soil moisture study \"ISCOM VIII, Classification and Management of Wet Soils, 1990.\"  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.  Classification change from Vertic Hapludalfs to Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs based on a study of associated soils where significant iron reduction and depletion has been measured in the A and, to a lesser extent, the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Aquic conditions occur for periods long enough in most years to cause iron reduction and mobility, as well as iron oxidation.  In addition, the majority of pedons have value moist of 4 or more and value dry of 6 or more, supporting the Chromic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 23 to 165 cm (9 to 65 in) (Bt and Btk horizons)\nAquertic feature: Cracks and/or wedge-shaped aggregates within the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Intermittent aquic conditions are expressed by value of 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 in the matrix of the upper part of the argillic horizon, in association with masses of oxidized iron in this zone.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  S55TX-79-92, published in SSIR-30.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
