  "OVERVIEW": "The Encantado series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from granitic fanglomerate and sandstone.  Encantado soils are on shoulders and backslopes of eroded fan remnants with slopes ranging from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
