  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Encantado soils are on shoulders and backslopes of erosional fan remnants.  They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from granitic fanglomerate and sandstone.  These parent rocks are weakly cemented by calcite and contain some limestone sand grains and gravel.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."

Altazano soils are coarse-loamy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on frequently flooded inset fans of erosional fan remnants.  Buckhorse soils are coarse-loamy, have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Nazario soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and occur on adjacent narrow summits of erosional fan remnants.  Tanoan soils are coarse-loamy and occur on adjacent shoulders and footslopes of erosional fan remnants."
