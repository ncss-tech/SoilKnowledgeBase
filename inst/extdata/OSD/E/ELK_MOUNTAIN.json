  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil typically is free of carbonates in the upper 8 to 20 inches unless recharged by run-on water or wind.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 10 to 25 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are channers or semirounded gravel.  About half the coarse fragments break down upon pretreatment.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  The EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout and is highest in the Bk horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Surface crusting is common in areas devoid of vegetation.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture typically is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and less commonly loam with 8 to 18 percent clay, 0 to 40 percent silt, and sand from 50 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand with 4 to 12 percent clay.  Secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 3 to 12 percent.  Gypsum is common in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nA thin C horizon is in some pedons.  It has the same color, texture, and reaction as the Bk horizon but lacks the secondary carbonate accumulations.  Some pedons have a thin, highly variable 2C horizon immediately above the bedrock.\nThe Cr horizon is brown or pale brown, soft sandstone.  The soil-bedrock interface constitutes a paralithic contact. The bedrock has been observed to be greater than 10 feet thick in most areas."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cotha, Rawlins, Ryan Park, and Ryark series.  Cotha soils lack carbonates throughout and  are neutral or slightly alkaline in the C horizon.  Rawlins and Ryan Park soils are deep.  Ryark soils are deep and have loamy sand or gravelly sand substrata."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elk Mountain soils are hill and ridge backslopes, shoulders, footslopes, and summits.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from calcareous, soft sandstone.  Slopes are both simple and complex and range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 6,200 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 100 days."
