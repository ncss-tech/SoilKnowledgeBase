Abgese, Greenbrae, Lank- bush, Morfitt, Paulville, Sevy, Turria, and Wenatchee soils lack a paralithic contact.  Lankbush soils are noncalcareous above a depth of 40 inches and have a solum 30 to 50 inches thick.  Morfitt soils lack lime above depth of 40 inches.  Sevy soils have a calcic Horizon at 16 to 34 inches.  Wenatchee soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick.  Zane soils have 5YR and 7.5YR hues in the Bt horizon and lack a paralithic contact above 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eusbio soils are on nearly level to very steep alluvial fans or terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,300.  The soil is formed from consolidated silt stone or tuff of the Payette or related Tertiary formation.  In places there may be a minor admixture of loessial material in the surface horizon.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers and annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 90 to 140 days."
