  "OVERVIEW": "The Eusbio series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or residuum from old lacustrine sediments.  Eusbio soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Lankbush soils are noncalcareous above a depth of 40 inches and have a solum 30 to 50 inches thick.  Morfitt soils lack lime above depth of 40 inches.  Sevy soils have a calcic Horizon at 16 to 34 inches.  Wenatchee soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick.  Zane soils have 5YR and 7.5YR hues in the Bt horizon and lack a paralithic contact above 40 inches."

The soil is formed from consolidated silt stone or tuff of the Payette or related Tertiary formation.  In places there may be a minor admixture of loessial material in the surface horizon.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers and annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 90 to 140 days."
