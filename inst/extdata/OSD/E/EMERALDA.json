Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons, from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Bt horizons, from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the BC horizon, and moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red range from few to many.  Weighted average clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is more than 35 percent.

The very poorly drained Chobee, Delray, and Manatee soils are on lower positions and are Mollisols.  In addition, Chobee and Manatee soils have less clay in the control section while Delray soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  The very poorly or poorly drained Felda soils are on similar to lower positions, have less clay in the control section, and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness."

Some small areas have been cleared and are used mostly for improved pasture.  Native vegetation consists of live oak, laurel oak, water oak, scattered slash pine, sweetgum, and red maple with an understory of waxmyrtle, cabbage palm, sawpalmetto, gallberry, cutgrass, beaked panicum, and sand cordgrass."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon:  the zone from 0 to 11 inches (A and Eg horizons).\nMollic feature:  the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon:  the zone from 11 to 56 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and BCg horizons).\nThe water table is at depths of less than 10 inches for 6 to 9 months during most years and is saturated during most of the year.\nThis soil was formerly a part of the Meggett series.  This definition restricts these soils to those that have A horizons with moist values of 3 or less and 6 to 10 inches thick and Ap horizons that have moist values less than 3.5.  Also, the mean annual soils temperature in Meggett soils is less than 72 degrees F.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
