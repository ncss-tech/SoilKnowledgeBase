  "OVERVIEW": "The Emeralda series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly or very slowly permeable soils in broad, low areas generally near lakes and streams in the lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in clayey marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

This definition restricts these soils to those that have A horizons with moist values of 3 or less and 6 to 10 inches thick and Ap horizons that have moist values less than 3.5.  Also, the mean annual soils temperature in Meggett soils is less than 72 degrees F."
