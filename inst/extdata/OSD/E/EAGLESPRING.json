  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days with in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to fractured bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent channers.  The upper 7 to 14 inches is estimated to have 20 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent channers and 2 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe AB horizon has color similar to the A horizon and has 25 to 50 percent channers.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loam with 18 to 25 percent clay and has 60 to 75 percent channers.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron is estimated to be 0.15 to 0.35 percent based on associated soils."

Borgeau soils are very deep, have a mollic epipedon 7 to 17 inches thick, and have 3 to 8 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Garrison soils have a mollic epipedon 12 to 20 inches thick and are 24 to 36 inches to sand, gravel, and cobbles.  Louiecreek soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 15 inches thick and less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Raisio soils are moderately deep.  Vanbrunt soils are moderately deep and have 3 to 8 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Wagberg soils are very deep and are dry for 90 to 105 days.  Whitestone soils have a mollic epipedon 10 to 18 inches thick and have 3 to 8 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eaglespring soils are on strongly sloping to very steep north-facing side slopes of mountains.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash.   Slopes are 12 to 80 percent. Elevations are 1600 to 3800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degree F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
