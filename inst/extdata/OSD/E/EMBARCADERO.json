  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils formed in saturated soil conditions at or near sea level. Due to subsidence of the Santa Clara valley, many areas of Embarcadero soils are now below sea level and would be flooded by bay waters if not protected by levees. Historic over drafting of the groundwater of the Santa Clara valley has drained Embarcadero soils of water in the soil profile and the soils are considered drained and protected today. The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F. The soil moisture control section is now dry in all parts from about May 1 to November 1 (about 180 days). The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nMineralogy is smectitic. The soil is calcareous below the A horizon and some A horizons may be calcareous. Carbonate masses occur below the A horizon ranging from 2 to 60 percent with occasional carbonate concretions occurring below 1 meter in some pedons. Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to a depth of 40 centimeters. Salinity ranges from EC of 2 to 10 with some areas as high as 50. Sodicity ranges from SAR of 5 to 100.\nThe An horizon dry color is 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 3/1, or 2.5Y 5/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/1 or 2.5Y 4/2. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Clay content ranges from 27 to 40 percent.  Reaction ranges from 7.8 to 9.5.\nThe Bkn1 horizon dry color is 10YR 6/4, 6/2, 5/1, 3/1, or 2.5Y 5/2, 5/1. Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 2/1 or 2.5Y 5/3, 4/3, 3/2. Texture is silty clay loam, clay or silty clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Reaction ranges from 7.8 to 10.0.\nThe Bkn2, Bkn3, Bkn4 horizons dry color is 10YR 8/1, 4/2, 5/1 or 5Y 8/1, 5/1 or 2.5Y 7/3, 6/3, 5/3, 5/1. Moist color is 10YR 7/1, 4/1, 3/2 or 5Y 7/1, 5/1, 4/1 or 2.5Y 5/3, 4/4, 4/3, 3/1. Texture is sandy clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Reaction ranges from 7.8 to 10.0.\nThe Bkn5, Bkn6 and BC horizons dry color is 5Y 8/1, 5/1 or 2.5Y 6/4, 6/3. Moist color is 5Y 7/1, 5/1 or 2.5Y 5/4, 5/3, 4/4. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam or silty clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Redoximorphic features are iron depletions, dry color is 10YR 5/2 or 5Y 6/2 or 5GY 6/0.  Moist color is 5Y 5/2 or 5GY 5/0 or 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/1. Reaction ranges from 7.8 to 9.5."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Embarcadero soils are in basins, occupying the lowest part adjacent to saline tidal marshes. Salinity and sodicity are high due to the evaporative environment. Under natural conditions, flooding was frequent from saline marsh waters and stream flooding of the basin. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from alluvium. Elevation is 0 to 10 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches. The mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F. Frost free season is 275 to 325 days."

Subsidence has occurred in the Santa Clara Valley from the groundwater over drafting, and has lowered these soils several feet requiring the use of levees to keep out bay waters."
