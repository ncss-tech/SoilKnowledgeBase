  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eitzen series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of recent silty alluvial sediments which overlie a buried soil. These soils are on narrow flood plains in the upper parts of stream valleys. They have moderate permeability. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The control section has 18 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Dry value is 4 or 5. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3, but it has value of 3 to 5 in thin strata. It is silt loam, with thin strata of loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an ABb horizon.\nThe Btb horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has mottles in some pedons. It is silt loam or loam. It has faint or distinct clay films on faces of peds. It has as much as 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part in some pedons. It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nA 2BC or 2C horizon or both with loamy sand to coarse sand textures are below depths of 60 inches in some pedons. These horizons also have as much as 10 percent rock fragments in some pedons."

Mt. Carroll and Port Byron soils formed in thick loess and are on summits. Frankville soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in a thin layer of clayey residuum from limestone and are on summits and shoulders. Newhouse soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in loamy underlying erosional sediment. Valton soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in a clayey underlying erosional sediment. The latter three soils are on adjacent hill slopes."
