    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the recent silty alluvial sediments and depth to the buried soil ranges from 20 to 36 inches. The control section has 18 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Dry value is 4 or 5. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3, but it has value of 3 to 5 in thin strata. It is silt loam, with thin strata of loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an ABb horizon.\nThe Btb horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has mottles in some pedons. It is silt loam or loam. It has faint or distinct clay films on faces of peds. It has as much as 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part in some pedons. It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nA 2BC or 2C horizon or both with loamy sand to coarse sand textures are below depths of 60 inches in some pedons. These horizons also have as much as 10 percent rock fragments in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eitzen soils have slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on flood plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils are on narrow flood plains in the upper parts of stream valleys. They formed in 20 to 36 inches of recent silty alluvial sediments which overlie a buried soil. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Frankville, Mt. Carroll, Newhouse, Port Byron, and Valton soils. All of these soils are well drained and are on adjacent hill slopes. Mt. Carroll and Port Byron soils formed in thick loess and are on summits. Frankville soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in a thin layer of clayey residuum from limestone and are on summits and shoulders. Newhouse soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in loamy underlying erosional sediment. Valton soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in a clayey underlying erosional sediment. The latter three soils are on adjacent hill slopes."
