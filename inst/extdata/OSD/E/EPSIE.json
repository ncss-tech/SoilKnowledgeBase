  "OVERVIEW": "The Epsie series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 3 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
