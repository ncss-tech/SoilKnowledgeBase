A horizons dark enough to be mollic typically are 4 inches thick and do not exceed 6 inches in thickness. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has mixed colors of the A and C horizons.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have AC horizons.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or neutral; value of 5 or 6 and 6 to 8 dry; and chroma of 1 or less.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  Carbonates are disseminated or as accumulations.   Clay loam glacial till typically is between depths of 40 and 60 inches but is below 60 inches in some pedons.  Few to many accumulations of gypsum are in some pedons."
