  "OVERVIEW": "The Eldgin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from andesite, dacite, basalt and tuff. Eldgin soils occur on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches (250 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F (6 degrees C).",
