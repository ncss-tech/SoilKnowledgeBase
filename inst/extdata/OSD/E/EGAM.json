Reaction is neutral to moderately acid in the A and B horizon, below about 50 inches it ranges from moderately alkaline to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have a few faint gray and brown mottles in the lower part.  Texture is dominantly silty clay loam or silt loam but a few pedons are loam or silty clay.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon is part of the mollic epipedon and in some pedons has colors like the A horizon.  Below this, the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redox features is shades of brown or gray are few to common and those with chroma 1 or 2 range from none to common.\nBelow about 50 inches, the Bw horizon or C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 6.  Redox features are in shades of brown and gray and some pedons are mottled without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is dominantly silty clay loam, silty clay or clay, but some pedons range to clay loam or coarser."

Similar soils are the Agee, Arrington, Bowdre, Cannon, Catalpa, Godwin, Lanton, and Staser series in closely related families.  Frioton soils have free carbonates in the solum.  Arrington soils are fine-silty and Cannon and Staser soils are fine-loamy.  Bowdre and Catalpa soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Agee, Godwin, and Lanton soils are more poorly drained. They have distinct or prominent gray mottles in the mollic epipedon or dominantly gray colors just below the mollic epipedon."
