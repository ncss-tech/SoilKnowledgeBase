  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the natric horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Typically, these soils have free carbonates at the surface due to recharge, but some pedons may be leached to 4 inches.  The weighted organic carbon content of the upper 15 inches is less than .4 percent.  Coarse fragment content of the entire soil is typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles or channers.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.  EC ranges from 0 to 12 mmhos.\nThe Btn or natric horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay silty clay, silty clay loam, or heavy clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 15 to 45 percent sand. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  EC ranges from 2 to 16 mmhos.  Reaction is very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bnkyz horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam,  silty clay loam, or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  Carbonates range from 4 to 15 percent.  EC ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  The subordinate designators may vary, but this horizon always has an accumulation of carbonate, sodium, gypsum, and salts more soluble than gypsum.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Weighted texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Thin strata of varying textures occur below 30 inches in some pedons.  Carbonates, gypsum, and salts are present but are less concentrated than defined for the Bnkyz.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 12 to 30 percent and occurs erratically throughout this horizon. EC ranges from 2 to 16 mmhos but typically averages about 8 mmhos for this horizon.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buckaroo, Calneva(T), Churchill, Kleinbush, McElmo(T), Meeteetse, Tohona, Ultra, Updike, and Uvada series.  Buckaroo soils have strong structure in the Btn and do not contain accumulations of soluble salts and gypsum.  Calneva soils contain less than 15 percent sand in the natric horizon and have MAST of 53 to 56 degrees F.  Churchill soils have a MAST of 55 to 57 degrees F.  and have lacustrine deposits at 15 inches or less. Kleinbush soils have buried horizons between 20 and 40 inches. McElmo soils have MAST of 52 to 54 degrees F.  Meeteetsee soils have 5YR or 7.5YR hues throughout the natric horizon and substratum.  Tohona soils are 20 to 40 inches to shale bedrock.  Ultra soils are noncalcareous.  Updike soils do not have E horizons.  Uvada soils have silty clay loam or silty clay natric horizons and formed in lake and deltaic sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Effington soils are on toeslopes and terraces.  The soils formed in alluvium weathered from sodic shales.  Slopes are typically less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 9 inches of which about half falls as rain and snow during April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 to 140."
