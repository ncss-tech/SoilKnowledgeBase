  "OVERVIEW": "The Eimarsh series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, shale, and quartzite.  Eimarsh soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
