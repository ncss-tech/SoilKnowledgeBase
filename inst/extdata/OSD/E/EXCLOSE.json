Paver, Polonio and Vernalis soils (MLRA 17), on alluvial fans, are formed in alluvium with slopes less than 9 percent, and are deeper than 60 inches. Paver soils do not have carbonates in the A horizon. Polonio soils have slightly hard or hard dry consistence in the A horizon. Vernalis soils have Bt horizons."

They are being differentiated by having a xeric moisture regime and being deeper than 40 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized within the profile are:\n1.   OCHRIC EPIPEDON--0 to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\n2.   CAMBIC HORIZON--19 to 29 inches (Bw horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedons S87CA-019-028 (taxadjunct 1513-1520) and\nS86CA-019-048 (taxadjunct 1219-1220) from the Fresno County, California, Western Part Soil Survey were analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
