    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 inches or more.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the A and E horizons, and ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Some pedons, generally in depressional areas, have a thin muck surface.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand; or these textures with mucky modifiers.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, red, yellow, or white range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay or clay and thin, less than 3 inches, layers of sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has the same color range as the Btg horizon.  Texture is sandy clay with pockets of sand, fine sand, or loamy sand."

The poorly drained Emeralda and Eureka soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches thick.  Felda soils are on similar positions and have less clay in the control section.  The poorly drained Meggett soils are on flood plain positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches thick.  Myakka, Pomona, and Wauchula soils are on similar positions and are Spodosols."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Easton soils have been cleared and are used principally for improved pasture and range.  Small areas with adequate water control are used for potatoes and truck crops.  The native vegetation is chiefly loblolly pine, longleaf pine, and slash pine, but includes magnolia, water oak, sweetgum, and bay.  The understory vegetation consists of several bluestem species, hairy panicum, and pineland threeawn.  Woody plants include gallberry, blackberry, scattered sawpalmetto, myrtle, and fetterbush.  In depressional areas, cypress trees are dominant.  The understory includes sand cordgrass, bluestem, maidencane, southern wildrice, St. Johnswort, cutgrass, and waxmyrtle."
