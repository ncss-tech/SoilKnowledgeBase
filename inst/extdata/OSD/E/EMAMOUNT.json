Gardone soils are have less than 5 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Bonnick soils have 2 to 10 percent clay content in the particle-size control section and have texture of dominantly ashy loamy sand.  Borobey soils have Bq horizons that are brittle when wet and have less than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Embal have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and commonly have secondary carbonates and silica accumulation.  Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin are deep to duripans.  Picturerock soils have secondary carbonates throughout."

They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and pyroclastic materials under wetter conditions than at present.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1704 to 2237 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
