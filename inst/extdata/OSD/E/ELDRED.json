Rock fragments, dominantly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the solum, and from 10 to 60 percent in the substratum. Reaction is strongly acid through extremely acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. The Bt horizon has redox depletions and redox concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon. Structure is subangular or angular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is similar to the C horizon. This horizon may have redoximorphic features. Structure is subangular blocky or platy. Consistence ranges from friable to very firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.
