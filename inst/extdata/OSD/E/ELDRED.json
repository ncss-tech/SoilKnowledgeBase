  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 34 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock, typically rippable shale and siltstone, is at depths greater than 72 inches. Rock fragments, dominantly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the solum, and from 10 to 60 percent in the substratum. Reaction is strongly acid through extremely acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. The Bt horizon has redox depletions and redox concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon. Structure is subangular or angular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is similar to the C horizon. This horizon may have redoximorphic features. Structure is subangular blocky or platy. Consistence ranges from friable to very firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Textures include loam, silt loam, silty clay loam and clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eldred soils are on nearly level to steep ridgetops, hillsides and valley sides. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded shale, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation is from 30 to 45 inches; and the growing season ranges from 90 to 120 days. These soils are mostly at elevations of 1,900 to 2,400 feet."

Carrollton, Gilpin, Ernest, Mandy, Onoville, Shongo, Rayne, and Wharton soils are on associated landscapes. Gilpin, Ernest, Rayne and Wharton soils have mesic temperature regimes. In addition, Carrollton and Gilpin soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Onoville and Shongo soils have a fragipan and Shongo soils have low chroma redoximorphic features within a depth of 16 inches. Mandy soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and lack an argillic horizon."
