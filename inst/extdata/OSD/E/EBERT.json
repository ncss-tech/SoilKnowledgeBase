  "OVERVIEW": "The Ebert series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in terrace deposits derived from basalt. Ebert soils are on relict terrace deposits. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
