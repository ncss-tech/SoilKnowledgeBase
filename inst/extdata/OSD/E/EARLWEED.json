  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Earlweed series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sand and sandstone residuum on dunes and sand sheets overlying structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
