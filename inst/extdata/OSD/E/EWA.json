  "OVERVIEW": "The Ewa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from basaltic rock.  Ewa soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 684 millimeters (27 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C. (73 degrees F.).",
