  "OVERVIEW": "The Euharlee series consists of well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on uplands.  These soils have very dark gray A horizons, grayish brown silt loam E horizons, brownish loam and clay loam Bt horizons over mottled gravelly silty clay BC and C horizons.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to hard rock is more than 60 inches.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except for surface layers that have been limed.  The gravel content ranges from 3 to 15 percent by volume in the A, E, BE and Bt horizons and from 10 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons.  The average clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent, and silt content from 30 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3, 4, or 5, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5, 6, or 7, and chroma of 4, 6, or 8.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4, 5, or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Red, brown, and yellow mottles range from none to common in the upper part and few to many in the lower part.  In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled and lacks a dominant matrix color.  Texture is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon is mottled red, brown, yellow, gray, and white.  It is cherty clay, cherty silty clay, cherty silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam."

Apison, Hartsells, Linker, Nauvoo, Oktaha, Pirum and Sipsey have bedrock at depths less than 60 inches.  Cahaba, Cowarts, Emporia, Kempsville, Marvin, Smithdale, Suffolk, and Vaucluse have formed in Coastal Plain sediments.  Durham soils have formed in residuum from crystalline rocks.  Spadra soils have formed in alluvial sediments.  Springtown soils have 1 to 5 percent plinthite in the lower part of the Bt horizon."
