The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has an average of 35 to 50 percent clay and contains 50 to 90 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has a value of 2 moist, 4 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles and 15 to 40 percent stones.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a value of 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is a very stony clay, extremely stony clay or extremely stony clay loam.  It has 30 to 50 percent clay and 50 to 90 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments are 15 to 35 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 25 to 50 percent stones and boulders.\nThe 3C horizon has a value of 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely stony loam with 15 to 27 percent clay.  It has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments.  It has rock fragment content similar to the 2Bt horizon."
