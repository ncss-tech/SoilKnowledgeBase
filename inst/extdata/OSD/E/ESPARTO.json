    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 24 to 50 inches to the bottom of the Bt Horizon, and mean annual soil temperature ranges from 62 to 66_F Mineralogy is mixed and the soil is dry most years for more than 60 days between the 10 and 40 inch depths. The A3 or B1 horizon typically is the most porous part of the profile. The A horizon colors are in lOYR hues and have values of 6 dry and 4 moist.\nChromas are 3 or 4. In uncultivated areas the top inch or so may be brown dry (1OYR 5/3) and have weak platy structure. Texture is loam or gravelly loam and structure is massive below the top inch.  Consistence is hard to very hard and reaction ranges from slightly acid to medium acid. The Bt horizon colors range from lOYR and 7.5YR hues with values of 6 dry and 4 moist. Chromas are 2 or 4. Texture ranges from heavy sandy loam through light silty clay loam and the horizon always is porous. The B horizons massive to angular blocky and reaction is slightly acid to neutral. Thin wavy clay bands often occur in this horizon as a result of moderately thick clay films in pores.\nThe lower part of the profile usually is weakly stratified."

The Los Robles soils have brown, neutral A horizons and silty clay loam Bt horizons. The Maywood soils have coarse loamy control sections."

Elevations range from 200 to 2400 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 16 to 35 inches with hot, dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is bout 63degrees F, average January temperature about 47 degrees F and average July temperature about 82 degrees F."
