The Reedy soils have stratified upper horizons over a fine-silty substratum.  The Bartlett soils have a sandy substratum and are calcareous.  The Funter and Kriwoi soils consist of moderately thick organic materials over a stratified substratum.  The Kaskulu soils are acid in reaction.  The Sumdum soils are acid, have no stratification, and have fine texture throughout.  The Ustay soils have a coarse loamy texture"
