  "OVERVIEW": "The Eagleson series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and rhyolite. Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
