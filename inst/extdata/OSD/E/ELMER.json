  "OVERVIEW": "The Elmer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in stratified calcareous loamy alluvium. These soils are on terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters), and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",
