  "OVERVIEW": "The Elmont series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from noncalcareous silty shales. These soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
