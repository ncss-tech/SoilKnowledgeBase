  "OVERVIEW": "The Ensley series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines, end moraines, and wave cut terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C. (43 degrees F).",
