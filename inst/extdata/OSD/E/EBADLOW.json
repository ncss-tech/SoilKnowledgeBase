    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick. Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some subhorizon within 30 inches of the surface. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and has more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Rock fragments in the particle size control section average 10 to 20 percent, but can range up to 30 percent. Depth to the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  Depth to skeletal material ranges from 25 to 35 inches and may include the lower part of the particle size control section in some pedons. Some pedons have secondary lime accumulation between 46 and 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe Bt1 horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist. Rock fragments range from 2 to 5 percent.\nThe Bt2 horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist. Rock fragments range from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a color value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. It is a very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam. Rock fragments range from 50 to 70 percent.\nThe 3BCt horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist. Rock fragments range from 60 to 80 percent by volume."
