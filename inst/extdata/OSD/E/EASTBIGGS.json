  "OVERVIEW": "The Eastbiggs series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Eastbiggs soils are on mounds on low terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, (559 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",

A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and 14 inches, (36 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through April.  Some pedons have lime in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 6/2, 10YR 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 3/4.
