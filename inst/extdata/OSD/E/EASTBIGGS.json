    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches, (51 to 102 cm).  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F, (16 to 18 degrees C).  The soil moisture control section is dry from June to November (170 to 190 days).  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.  There is an abrupt boundary at the top of the argillic horizon with an absolute clay increase of at least 15 percent.  Mineralogy is mixed.  Redoximorphic features such as manganese nodules, manganese masses with colors of N 2/0 moist, and oxidized iron masses with colors of 7.5YR 4/6 or 5/6 moist, occur from 3 to 34 inches, (8 to 86 cm).  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and 14 inches, (36 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through April.  Some pedons have lime in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 6/2, 10YR 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 3/4.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Redding, San Joaquin and Yuvas soils.  Redding soils lack a water table, have gravel throughout, and are on mounds on high terraces.  San Joaquin soils lack a water table, are formed from alluvium from dominantly granitic sources and are on low terraces.  Yuvas soils have siltstone (densic material) underlying the duripan and are on remnant terraces and basin rims."
