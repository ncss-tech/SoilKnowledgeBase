    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The Ethania soils formed in a mantle of slightly weathered pumice and cinders overlying colluvium and residuum from sandstone, andesite or glacial till.  The climate is marine influenced with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 110 inches, with a large portion of it in the form of rain and snow in the winter months.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
