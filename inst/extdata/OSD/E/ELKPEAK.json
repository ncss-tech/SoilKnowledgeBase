  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, or igneous rock. These soils are on escarpments, mountain slopes or landslides. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
