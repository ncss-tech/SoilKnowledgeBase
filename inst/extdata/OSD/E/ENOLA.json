  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F.  The soils have udic moisture regime but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 30 inches.  The A and Bw horizon is estimated to have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.  The 10- to 40-inch control section and solum are fine sandy loam and average less than 18 percent clay and less than 35 percent rock fragments. Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in the B horizon and increase to 40 percent in the lower part of the C horizon in some pedons. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel size.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 1 through 3 dry.  It is moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe upper B horizon commonly has hue of 7.5YR but variegations of 5YR are in some pedons; the lower part of the B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; the B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist; 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has weak very fine subangular blocky structure or is massive.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry. It is friable or firm."

The soils formed in glacial till of late Pleistocene origin and weathered mostly from andesitic and basaltic rocks and mixed with ash and pumice. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches. The mean annual temperature 45 to 50 degrees F. The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 160 days."
