    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 70 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes the upper part of the 2Bt horizon.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR throughout.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and averages less than 15 percent rock fragments.  The A and Bw horizons have 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 0.8 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has colors similar to the A horizon.  It is ashy loam or ashy clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel in the upper part of the 2Bt horizon and 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent gravel in the lower part.  The lower part of the 2Bt horizon has less than 1 percent organic matter."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elderflat soils are on plateaus and benches and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  They formed in fine-textured colluvium and residuum derived from basalt.  Usually Elderflat soils are found as mounds in patterned ground topography.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  Elevation is 2,500 to 4,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free period is 80 to 120 days."

Akerite soils are in concave positions on plateaus, are ashy over loamy, and are moderately well drained.  Gaib soils are found in convex areas of plateaus, are loamy-skeletal, and are shallow to bedrock.  Hankins soils are on gently rolling plateaus and benches, are very deep, and have an O horizon.  Rockly soils are very shallow, loamy-skeletal, and are found in complex with Elderflat soils on plateaus.  Top soils are found on adjacent north facing side slopes, are very deep, and have an O horizon."
