  "OVERVIEW": "The Eaupleine series consists of deep, moderately well to well drained, gently sloping and sloping, silty soils that formed in loess and underlying loamy glacial till or loamy residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock. These upland soils have moderate permeability. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges from 84 to 167 centimeters in thickness but typically is 100 to 150 centimeters thick. In undisturbed areas, an A horizon 8 to 13 centimeters thick is present instead of an Ap horizon. The depth to bedrock is typically below 160 cm but can be observed as shallow as 4 feet (120cm).\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E/B or B/E horizons have tongues of E material surrounding thin, column-like upward extensions of the Bt horizon or wholly surrounding small, isolated remnants of the Bt horizon. The E part has lOYR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam. The Bt part has lOYR or 7.5YR hue, value and chroma of 4 or 5. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt horizons have 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value is 4 or 5; and chroma is 3 through 6. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues. The particle-size control section averages between 10 to 18 percent clay and between 25 and 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe 2C horizon has 5Y, 2.5Y, lOYR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value is 4 or 5; and chroma is 4 through 8. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogues."

Alban soils do not contain coarse fragments. Amery soils typically have more sand and less silt in the upper part of the solum. Freeon soils have mottles in the argillic horizon. Kennan soils have fewer pebbles in the part of the argillic horizon above a depth of 100 centimeters. Langlade soils have more silt and less sand in the lower part of the argillic horizon above a depth of 100 centimeters. Marathon soils contain more coarse fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon above a depth of 100 centimeters. Rosholt soils have sand and gravel within a depth of 100 centimeters. Scott Lake soils have mottles in the argillic horizon and coarser textures within a depth of 100 centimeters."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on bedrock controlled uplands. Slopes are simple or complex and gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. EauPleine soils formed in 36 to 72 centimeters of loess and in the underlying loamy glacial till\nand loamy residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock. The till is derived mainly from the local residuum. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 71 to 84 centimeters."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altdorf, Dolph, Fenwood, Milladore, Rozellville, and Sherry soils. Altdorf and Dolph soils are nearby, but have the lower part of the sola formed in residuum weathered from micaceous schists. The somewhat poorly drained Milladore and poorly drained and very poorly drained Sherry soils are on very gently sloping and flat or concave positions, in areas marginal to the higher-lying, low ridge sites of EauPleine soils. The Fenwood and Rozellville soils are associates in some landscapes, but they cannot always be separated from EauPleine soils by specific relief."

The range in characteristics were taken from the Wood County manuscript and a 1984 OSD revision for Marathon County, WI.  The series was inactive for a while but was reactivated because the series is still correlated in Wood County Wisconsin.  Original classification - COARSE-LOAMY, MIXED TYPIC GLOSSOBORALFS"
