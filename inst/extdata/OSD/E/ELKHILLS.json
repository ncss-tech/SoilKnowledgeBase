  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between depth of 8 and 32 inches is dry in all parts from May 1 until the end of December and is moist in all parts for less than 60 consecutive days in winter. Mean annual soil temperature is 61 degrees to 65 degrees F. The soil is slightly to violently effervescent throughout. Carbonates are usually disseminated, but segregated lime occurs in some areas with 5 to 20 percent calcium carbonate. Rock fragments occur is well rounded pebbles or cobbles and occupy 0 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/4, 7/3, 6/4, 6/3 or 5/4. Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3 or 3/3. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or loam. Organic matter is less than 1 percent and decreases regularly with depth. Clay content is 6 to 18 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 8/3, 8/2, 7/4, 7/3, 7/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 7/4, 7/3, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/4, or 4/3 Texture is usually sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or loam with a clay content of 5 to 18 percent. The C2 horizon is stratified with textures ranging from gravelly coarse sand to silt loam."

Bitterwater soils are 40 to 60 inches deep over soft sedimentary rock, have less than 20 percent silt content and lack lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 40 inches. Kimberlina soils are 0 to 9 percent slopes and the calcium carbonate is less than 5 percent. McCullough soils have a thin strata of hue 5YR or 7.5YR and have a sand texture within a depth of 40 inches. Seaman soils are clearly stratified Cantua soils are noneffervescent to depth of more than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary and granitic rock. The climate is arid (desert) with hot dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches with no summer precipitation. Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees to 64 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."
