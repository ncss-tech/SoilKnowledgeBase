  "OVERVIEW": "The Edalph series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium derived from granite.  Edalph soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
