  "OVERVIEW": "The Emeraldlake series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in tephra mixed with colluvium from volcanic rocks. Emeraldlake soils are on cirque walls, volcanic domes, colluvial aprons and mountain slopes in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 95 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 117 inches (2972 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F (4 degrees C).",
