  "OVERVIEW": "The Elements series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains and hills.  These soils formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic alluvium and colluvium.  Slopes range from 30 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
