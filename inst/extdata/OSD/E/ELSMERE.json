  "OVERVIEW": "The Elsmere series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mostly eolian sands on interdunes on sandhills. Some areas formed in alluvial sands on stream terraces on valleys. They formed in eolian sands. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 53 centimeters (21 inches) at the type location.",
