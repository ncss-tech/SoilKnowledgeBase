These soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 95 to 130 inches.  Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F, average July temperature is about 59 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 160 days."
