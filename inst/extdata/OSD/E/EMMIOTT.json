  "OVERVIEW": "The Emmiott series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in continental glacial outwash.  These soils are on glacial outwash plains and have slopes from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
