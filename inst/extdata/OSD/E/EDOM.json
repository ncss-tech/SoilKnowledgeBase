  "OVERVIEW": "The Edom series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from interbedded shaly or platy limestone and calcareous shale.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow to moderate.  Mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 72 inches or more.  Rock fragments of shale or limestone range from about 2 to 35 percent in the solum and from 20 to 90 percent in the C horizon  and increase with depth in the profile.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the upper part of the solum and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part and in the C horizon.  Some pedons have free carbonates in the B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some undisturbed pedons have an E horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Texture is silty clay or clay with 40 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section, except that the upper part may be silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of silty clay loam and clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak to strong, fine or medium, subangular blocky or blocky and occasionally platy in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction and contains a large amount of weathered, often interbedded shale and limestone fragments."

Alexandria and St. Clair soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in any part of the series control section.  Lairdsville soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Lucas and Saylesville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and do not have rock fragments.  Millheim soils have chroma of 2 in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon.  Morley soils have texture of silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction of the lower part of the B horizon.  Pate soils have sola greater than 50 inches thick.  Schoharie soils have few or no rock fragments above 40 inches."
