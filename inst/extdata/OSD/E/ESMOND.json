  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It has 8 to 18 percent clay, 36 to 56 percent fine and coarser sand, and 1 to 10 percent rock fragments.  In some pedons, it contains mixed pockets of sand, fine sand, loam, silt loam and occasional lenses of gravel.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  In some plowed fields it has hue of 2.5Y and/or chroma of 2.  It typically is loam, but in some pedons it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe ABk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 30 percent.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or silt loam.  It is laminated, massive or stratified till.  Below depths of 40 inches in some pedons it is loamy sand or clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Esmond soils are on convex positions on nearly level to very steep till plains and moraines.  Slope gradients typically are 6 to 15 percent, but range from 2 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in loamy calcareous glacial till.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 22 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer.  Frost-free days range from 95 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 2000 feet."

Esmond soils are on summits and convex shoulder slopes; Emrick soils are on concave foot slopes and toe slopes and in swales; Fram are in swales and on flats; and Heimdal soils are on convex and plane side slopes.  Emrick soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Fram soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Heimdal soils have a cambic horizon."
