  "OVERVIEW": "The Elmwood series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loamy outwash materials over clayey marine or lacustrine deposits on lake and marine plains, and outwash plains and deltas. Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and slow or very slow in the clayey substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches at the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the underlying fine-textured material ranges dominantly from 20 to 40 inches with a few pedons ranging to 18 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The coarse-loamy material has 0 to 3 percent rock fragments and the clayey material lacks rock fragments. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid above the lithologic discontinuity and from moderately acid to slightly alkaline below. Thin horizons of loamy sand or loamy fine sand occur in some pedons above the lithologic discontinuity.\nThe Ap, or A horizon where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam. It has weak or moderate fine granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam except thin layers of loamy sand or loamy fine sand are allowed. It has weak or moderate very fine or fine granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  It has weak thin to thick platy structure that may part to subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Some pedons have thin strata of coarser material ranging from sand to silt below a depth of 40 inches.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium subangular blocky, moderate medium to very thick platy, or prismatic structure that parts to blocky, or the horizon is massive.  Thin films of silt or clay are present on faces of peds in some pedons.  Some pedons have manganese stains on faces of peds in the lower part of the horizon."

These soils formed in loamy outwash or lacustrine materials underlain by fine-textured lacustrine or marine deposits. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 55 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 130 to 190 days. Elevation ranges from 5 to 900 feet above mean sea level."

Adams, Allagash and Madawaska soils do not have the fine-textured substratum and are in similar or higher positions on the landscape. Biddeford and Whately soils are very poorly drained soils in depressions. Buxton, Lamoine, Scantic and Suffield soils do not have the coarse-loamy mantle. Melrose soils are well drained and in higher positions on the landscape. Swanton soils are somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soils in lower positions on the landscape."

The soil is of moderate extent.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Amherst, Massachusetts.\nSERIES ESTABLISHED:  Connecticut Valley Survey, 1903.\nREMARKS:  1.  Elmwood soils were mapped and correlated as mesic soils prior to 1979. They were subsequently reclassified as having a frigid temperature regime and are now restricted to frigid areas. Its use in MLRA's 101, 144A, and 145 will be restricted. The Elmridge series is the mesic counterpart to Elmwood.  2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 31 inches (Bw1, Bw2 Bg, and 2Bw horizons).\nc.  Aquic conditions - redox features within 24 inches of the mineral soil surface."
