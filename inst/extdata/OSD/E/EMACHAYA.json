Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 through 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam or  clay loam.  Stratas of silt loam or fine sandy loam occur in some pedons.  It is mottled in shades of red, brown or gray.  Some pedons have C horizons that are not compacted within the profile.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 and chroma of 0.  It is shale."
