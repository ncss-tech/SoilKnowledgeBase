  "OVERVIEW": "The Emachaya Series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in reclaimed material from coal strip mines.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on strip mines in the Arkansas Ridges and Valley land resource area.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 degree F. and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",

Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 through 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam or  clay loam.  Stratas of silt loam or fine sandy loam occur in some pedons.  It is mottled in shades of red, brown or gray.  Some pedons have C horizons that are not compacted within the profile.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 and chroma of 0.  It is shale."

Lequire and Blocker soils are less then 20 inches deep over shale material.  Cartersville soils are less clayey and less than 20 inches deep over shale.  Whitefield soils are less than 40 inches deep over shale.  Kanima soils have more coarse fragments throughout the profile.  Latimer, Coalgate and Ironbridge soils have natric horizons."

Cartersville soils are on steeper areas and are less clayey than Hoyt soils.  Coalgate and Ironbridge soils are on similar areas but have Natric horizons.
