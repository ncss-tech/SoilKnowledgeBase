  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is typically 28 to 35 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation is 10 to 23 inches.  Rock fragments are typically less than 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent in the series control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Reaction is normally neutral, but ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The mollic colors do not extend below a depth of 16 inches. This horizon is clay or clay loam; clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 20 to 45 percent with more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is normally slightly alkaline but ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay or clay loam, with clay, silt and sand ranges the same as the Bt horizon. This horizon has accumulations of calcium carbonate occurring as threads, soft rounded masses, concretions, and is disseminated throughout the matrix.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay loam or clay. This horizon contains from 6 to 14 percent calcium carbonate in the form of soft masses, and nodules, and disseminated throughout.\nThe Cr horizon is primarily calcareous cretaceous shale which may be interbedded with calcareous loamstones or calcareous fine grained sandstone."

Ashfork, Chapin, Thunderbird and Wormser soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Blackpipe, Huggins, Loma, Richfield, and Savo soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Loma and Savo soils also lack a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches. Boneek, Collbran, Kube, Nunn, Rednun, Ryus, Sofia, and Torreon soils lack a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches."

The soils formed in fine textured, calcareous slopewash alluvium and residuum.  Elevations range from 2600 to 5,400 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees F. to 54 degrees F. mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches. Frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Razor soils lack a mollic epipedon and argillic horizon; they occur on more sloping parts of the landscape. Renohill soils lack a mollic epipedon and occur on drier positions. Samsil soils are shallow and lack a mollic epipedon and an argillic horizon; they occur on ridgecrests and near rock outcrops."
