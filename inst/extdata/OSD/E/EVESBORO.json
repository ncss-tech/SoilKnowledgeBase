  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Evesboro series is the mesic equivalent of the Lakeland series. The Bw horizonation is based on color. This layer does not constitute a cambic horizon because the texture is not very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or finer than these textures. Evesboro series have been reclassified from mesic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments to mesic, coated Lamellic Quartzipsamments.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 cm (Oe, A1 and A2 horizons)\nLamellic feature--Lamellae with total thickness of less than 15 cm (6 inches) in the series control section\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from characterization samples S58NJ-009-003, S58NJ-005-004, S58NJ-005-005, S74MD-033-001, S85MD-019-009, S86MD-019-011, S86MD-019-015, S94NJ-001-001, S94NJ-001-002 and S01MD-017-010 are available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.\n2006 OSD revision-JWB\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
