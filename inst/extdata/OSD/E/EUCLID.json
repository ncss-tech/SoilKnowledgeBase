  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Euclid soils have been cleared. Some of the cleared areas are used for permanent pasture and others are cultivated with corn, soybeans, and mixed hay as principal crops. Some areas are used for recreation such as golf courses and parks. Formerly cultivated areas near urban areas have stands of grasses, forbes, and shrubs. Sugar maple, beech, red maple, and ash are the main tree species. Native vegetation was mixed deciduous hardwood forest."
