  "OVERVIEW": "The Euclid series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified silty deposits on treads on low stream terraces. Permeability is moderate in the surface layer and moderately slow in the subsoil and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Some of the cleared areas are used for permanent pasture and others are cultivated with corn, soybeans, and mixed hay as principal crops. Some areas are used for recreation such as golf courses and parks. Formerly cultivated areas near urban areas have stands of grasses, forbes, and shrubs. Sugar maple, beech, red maple, and ash are the main tree species. Native vegetation was mixed deciduous hardwood forest."
