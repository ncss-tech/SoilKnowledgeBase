Also, Berit and Flex soils are slightly acid or neutral. Harvan soils a densic layer. Stodick soils are 36 to 50 cm to soft rock.  Penelas soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments.  Ravenell soils have a sandy clay or clay Bt horizon. Zyzzi soils have 50 to 75 percent rock fragments mainly 2 to 5 mm in size, more than 45 percent sand, and a sandy clay loam Bt horizon."
