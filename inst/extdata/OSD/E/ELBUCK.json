  "OVERVIEW": "The Elbuck series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Elbuck soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 635 mm.  The average annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
