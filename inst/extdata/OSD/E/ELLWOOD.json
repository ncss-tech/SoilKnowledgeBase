  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. The particle-size control section averages from 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 45 percent total sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Redox accumulations are below the surface horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nEllwood soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 or 4. Typically texture is clay loam or silty clay loam, but individual subhorizons in some pedons are loam, silt loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a Bk or C horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Durkeelake (T), Keshena, Parmalee (T), Perecheney, and Woodman series. A related soil is the Crossett series. Durkeelake and Perecheney soils have a sandy mantle in the upper part of the series control section. Keshena soils are more than 40 inches deep to carbonates. Parmalee soils are less than 40 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon. Woodman soils have lamellae in the lower part of the series control section. Crossett soils have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ellwood soils are on moraines. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Ellwood soils formed in loamy calcareous till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 700 feet to 1700 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crossett, Iosco, Menominee, Morganlake, Padus, Stambaugh, Vanzile, and Worcester series. The somewhat poorly drained Crossett soils are on slightly lower landscape positions than Ellwood soils and form a drainage sequence with them. The well drained Menominee soils, the moderately well drained Morganlake soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Iosco soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is a 20 to 40 inch thick sandy mantle. The well drained Padus and Stambaugh soils, the moderately well drained Vanzile soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils are on nearby outwash areas."

These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to May in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas of Ellwood soils are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland and some are used for woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Common trees are sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, American basswood, eastern hemlock, white spruce, white birch, quaking aspen, and balsam fir."
