  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. The particle-size control section averages from 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 45 percent total sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Redox accumulations are below the surface horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nEllwood soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 or 4. Typically texture is clay loam or silty clay loam, but individual subhorizons in some pedons are loam, silt loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a Bk or C horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above."

Parmalee soils are less than 40 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon. Woodman soils have lamellae in the lower part of the series control section.

The somewhat poorly drained Crossett soils are on slightly lower landscape positions than Ellwood soils and form a drainage sequence with them. The well drained Menominee soils, the moderately well drained Morganlake soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Iosco soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is a 20 to 40 inch thick sandy mantle. The well drained Padus and Stambaugh soils, the moderately well drained Vanzile soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils are on nearby outwash areas."
