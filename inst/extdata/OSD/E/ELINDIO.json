  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to more than 60 inches.   Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from about 10 to 25 percent in the A horizon and from about 20 to 40 percent in the B and C horizons.  Salinity is typically less than 2.0 mmho/cm, but in irrigated areas salinity ranges from 4 to 16 mmho/cm due to poor water management.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown and has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is clay loam or clay with a clay content of 30 to 45 percent.  An estimated 10 to 20 percent of the clay is carbonate clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5y or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 , and chroma of 2 through 4. Visible secondary calcium carbonate in the form of soft masses and concretions ranges from about 2 to 35 percent by volume in the lower part of the Bk horizon.  Some pedons have Ck horizons below 40 inches with colors the same as the Bk horizons."

Uvalde soils are dry in the moisture control section for shorter periods.  Acuna soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Angelo and Knippa soils crack when dry and have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Castroville, Lewisville, Nuvalde and Quanah soils are moist in the control section for longer periods of time.  Dant soils lack a calcic horizon within a depth of 40 inches and have a fine-loamy control section."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent but are mainly less than 1.5 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium that is high in calcium carbonate and is derived from limestone areas.  The climate is hot and semiarid.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches and the annual temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F.  Frost free period is 275 to 290 days and elevation ranges from 550 to 700 feet. The Thornthwaite P-E indices are about 21 to 27."
