The somewhat poorly drained Dusler soils are on slightly more convex portions of the landscape.  The poorly drained Hellwig, Schisler and Melrude soils are on similar landscapes.  Hellwig and Schisler soils have an upper 2 story mantle 20 to 40 inches thick.  Melrude soils formed in loamy sediments 60 or more inches thick.  The very poorly drained Baden soils are in shallow depressions, swales and along the edges of depressions of organic soils.  The very poorly drained Cathro soils are basins and depressions."
