  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizons, unless limed, and extremely acid to strongly acid in the B and C horizons.  The lower Bt and C horizons in some pedons contain plinthite nodules, but no horizon within 60 inches of the surface has as much as 5 percent plinthite.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions of 2 or less chroma are within 30 inches of the surface and lacking in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, and brown range from few to many in the middle and lower Bt horizons.  Some pedons have a Btg horizon which has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  Texture of the Bt and Btg horizons is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has more than 50 percent silt plus very fine sand and 18 to 35 percent clay.  Some pedons have silty clay or clay below 40 inches.\nSome pedons have a BCg or BC horizon which has the same color and texture range as the Btg and Bt horizons respectively.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, and commonly has patterns of iron depletions in shades of gray and brown and masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow or brown.  Texture is variable and ranges from sandy to clayey sediment.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2, and commonly masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is variable and ranges from sandy to clayey sediment."

Felkner soils have uncoated sand grains and silt coatings on ped surfaces.  In addition, Felkner soils lack plinthite nodules in the lower horizons.  Sawyer soils have clayey subhorizons in the B horizon."
