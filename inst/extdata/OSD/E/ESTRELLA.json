These soils formed in stratified and mixed alluvium that includes volcanic, granitic, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.  The mean annual air temperature is 70 to 76 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
