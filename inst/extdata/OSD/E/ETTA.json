These soils are dry in the 4 and 12 inch depths more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. and are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The dark colored C horizon has less than 1 percent organic matter below the 20 inch depth.  Some thin gravelly lenses occur below about 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  It ranges from loam to clay loam in the lower part.  This horizon has moderate fine granular to weak coarse angular blocky structure.  It is slightly hard or hard and slightly sticky and sticky.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline and is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; otherwise, it is the same in color as the A horizon.  It is dominantly clay loam containing 27 to 35 percent clay. Lenses of coarse material occur below about 30 inches in some pedons.  This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline and is noncalcareous in the upper part with some weak lime veining at a depth of about 40 inches."

The soils formed in deep alluvial soil material derived from mixed igneous parent material.  The climate is dry subhumid, with an average annual precipitation of 12 to 14 inches.  June is usually the driest month.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 108 days."
