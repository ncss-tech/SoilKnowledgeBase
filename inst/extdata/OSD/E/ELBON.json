  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section has an average clay content of 35 to 45 percent.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline and calcareous.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizons have colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.  Texture is mainly silty clay loam, but includes clay loam or clay.\nThe C horizon has colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has black or very dark gray strata in some pedons. Chroma of 2 or less apparently results from the high content of lime in the parent material.  Texture is mainly silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay loam, but the soils typically contain thin strata of coarser and finer materials.\nBuried horizons are common below a depth of 40 inches.  They are black, very dark gray, very dark brown, very dark grayish brown, or dark grayish brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Carbonate films and threads range from none to common."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Closely similar series are the Frio, Frioton, Nipsum, Pursley, Tinn, and Trinity series.   Frio and Nipsum soils are usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 90 or more days each year.  Frioton soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches.  Tinn and Trinity soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Pursley are less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Tinn and Trinity soils have intersecting slickensides."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elbon soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in recent loamy and clayey sediments washed from the nearby Claypan and Blackland Prairies.  Near the type location the average annual precipitation is about 45 inches, the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite P-E index is about 68."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Elbon soils are moderately well drained, have slow surface runoff; and have moderately slow permeability.  Where unprotected, these soils are flooded 2 to 5 times each year for durations of 1 to 3 days.  A water table is within a depth of 30 to 40 inches during winter and spring."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mostly as pasture and hayland.  Areas protected from flooding are used for cotton, grain sorghum, and soybeans.  Native vegetation is hackberry, ash, elm, osage orange, paspalums, wildrye, and greenbriar."
