When described, the soil was moist above 36 inches and saturated below 36 inches.                 (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)\nAp--0 to 8 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the layers below the A horizon.  Buried soil horizons generally at depths between 20 and 50 inches, but in some pedons, at depths greater than 50 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3.  The Ap or A horizon is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe C and C' horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  They have few to many mottles with chroma of 2 or less and none to common mottles in shades of gray, red, or brown.  Thin strata within the C and C' horizons range from none to many and are loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Bedding commonly is in alternating layers with two or more of these textures, but pedons having strata consisting of only one of these textures are within the range.  A few mica flakes are in the C and C' horizons of some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles range from few to common in shades of gray and brown.  It is stratified with textures as listed above for the C horizons.\nThe Bgb horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Concretions ranges from few to many.  Thin clay skins are on the faces of peds or in pores in some pedons.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon above the Bgb horizon with slightly darker colors and similar textures as the Bgb horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Competing series in similar families are the Bibb, Boggy, Enoree, Falaya, Gillsburg, Iuka, Lilbourn, Mantachie, Ochlockonee, and Stokly series.  Bibb soils have a matrix of chroma 2 or less immediately below the A horizon.  Boggy soils are nonacid.  Enoree and Lilbourn soils have mixed mineralogy and are nonacid.  Falaya and Gillsburg soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections.  Iuka and Ochlockonee soils do not have layers within 20 inches of the surface that have dominant chroma of 1 or 2.  Mantachie soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Stokly soils have mixed mineralogy and are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level floodplains along streams draining highly dissected areas of loamy and sandy coastal plain deposits.  They formed in stratified sandy and loamy alluvium ranging from 20 to more than 60 inches in thickness.  Slopes are commonly less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is warm and humid."

The Bibb soils are on slightly lower positions and the Iuka and Ochlockonee soils are on slightly higher positions.  The Smithdale, Luverne, and Lexington soils are on adjacent upland side slopes and have argillic horizons containing more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.  Enville soils are rarely to frequently flooded.  The soil is saturated with water below depths of 12 to 20 inches from late fall to mid-spring in most years. USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cropped to soybeans, corn, grain sorghum, and hay crops, or they are in pasture.  Some areas are wooded. Native vegetation is forest of yellow-poplar, water oak, willow oak, sweetgum, red maple, ironwood, hickory, alder, and in some places shortleaf and loblolly pine."
