  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 3 percent cobbles, 0 to 3 percent stones, and 0 to 3 percent boulders in the solum. They range from 0 to 15 percent gravel in the substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the surface and upper part of the subsoil and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.  Texture of the surface and subsoil horizons is fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction.  The substratum ranges from very fine sand to coarse sand and is stratified in some pedons.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 to 4.  Structure is weak granular or the horizon is massive.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Hue of 7.5YR is confined to the upper part of the B horizon and 2.5Y to the lower part.  The B horizons in some pedons have thin, strong brown lamellae. Structure is weak granular or the horizon is structureless.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6."

Gosil soils formed in siliceous sandy pedisediments over siliceous residuum from sandstone or both. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts in most years for 25 to 35 consecutive days in the 120 days following the summer solstice. Plymouth soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the substratum within 40 inches. Rockbluff soils have a paralithic contact at less than 60 inches. Runcliff soils have soil temperatures greater than 52 degrees F. and have thicker sola. Schaffenaker soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eastchop soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping outwash plains and gently sloping to steep moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in sandy glacial outwash with varying amounts of aeolian influence.  Annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 48 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F, and the frost-free season ranges from 120 to 150 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Plymouth soils and the Carver, Deerfield, Klej, Haven, Montauk, Plymouth, and Riverhead soils on nearby landscapes.  Carver soils are loamy coarse sand or coarser below 10 inches. Deerfield and Klej soils are moderately well drained on lower, concave positions. Haven and Riverhead soils have a loamy subsoil and commonly occur on less sloping landforms. Montauk soils have firm gravelly substrata. Eastchop is geologically intermingled in moraine areas with till soils, Montauk and Plymouth."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was previously mapped as Evesboro in Nantucket and Dukes counties, Massachusetts, and as Windsor in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Available mineralogy data for this soil (S80MA-001-001; University of Massachusetts) and nearby similar soils (RT81-MA007: 6 pedons) show the resistant mineral content averages 90 to 95 percent. Available data for nearby similar soils shows silt plus 2 times clay to be more than 5 for the control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric Epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 6 inches (A and Ap horizons).\n2. Coated family - weighted average silt plus 2 times weighted average clay is more than 5 in the zone 10 to 40 inches (A, Ap, Bw, BC, and C horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
