Some pedons have up to 14 percent quartz gravels throughout the profile.  Iron depletions with chroma 2 or less are within the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray range from none to common. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red or gray range from few to many; or it is multicolored in these colors.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown and red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon and the C or 2C horizons have the same range in hue, value, chroma, and redoximorphic features as the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Texture of the BC horizon is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Texture of the C or 2C horizon is fine sand, coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam; or these textures are stratified with sandy clay loam.  In some pedons, texture is stratified sandy loam, sandy clay loam and clay.\nThe BCg, Cg or 2Cg horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown and red range from common to many. Textures are similar to the BC, C or 2C horizons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chicora, Columbus, Mazarn, Mollicy, Whitwell and Yauhannah series in the same family and the Chatom and Slagle series in a closely related family.  Chatom and Slagle soils are on higher adjacent positions and are in a subactive cation-exchange activity class.  The moderately well drained Chicora soils are on higher non-flooding positions and have more than 25 percent silt in the control sections. Columbus and Whitwell soils are on similar positions and have more than 25 percent silt in the control section.  The somewhat poorly drained Marzan soils are in MLRA 119 (Ouachita Mountains) and are moderately deep to shale bedrock.  The somewhat poorly drained Mollicy soils are on similar positions but have 2B horizons.  Yauhannah soils are not subject to flooding and have a mixed clay fraction."

Slopes are generally between 0 and 3 percent but may range up to 6 percent.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F., frost free days ranges from 220 to 250, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 60 inches.  Elevation ranges from 120 to 450 feet above sea level."

The well drained Cahaba, Kalmia, Kenansville and Maxton soils are on higher positions.  In addition, Kalmia soils have contrasting textures within 40 inches of the surface, Kenansville soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick and Maxton soils do not flood.  Craven and the somewhat poorly drained Dunbar soils are on higher, non-flooding positions and have clayey control sections. Eulonia soils are on similar positions but have red, clayey subsoils.  Goldsboro soils are on higher adjacent non-flooding positions and have a solum thickness greater than 60 inches.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Johns soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, have a thinner solum and contrasting textures between the Bt and C horizons at a depth of less than 40 inches."
