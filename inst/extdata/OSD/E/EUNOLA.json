  "OVERVIEW": "The Eunola series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable loamy soils that formed in fluvial or marine sediments. They are on low stream or marine terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain (133A).  The average annual temperature near the type location is about 64 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 54 inches.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range up to 6 percent.",

Texture of the BC horizon is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Texture of the C or 2C horizon is fine sand, coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam; or these textures are stratified with sandy clay loam.  In some pedons, texture is stratified sandy loam, sandy clay loam and clay.\nThe BCg, Cg or 2Cg horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

Chatom and Slagle soils are on higher adjacent positions and are in a subactive cation-exchange activity class.  The moderately well drained Chicora soils are on higher non-flooding positions and have more than 25 percent silt in the control sections. Columbus and Whitwell soils are on similar positions and have more than 25 percent silt in the control section.  The somewhat poorly drained Marzan soils are in MLRA 119 (Ouachita Mountains) and are moderately deep to shale bedrock.  The somewhat poorly drained Mollicy soils are on similar positions but have 2B horizons.  Yauhannah soils are not subject to flooding and have a mixed clay fraction."

Craven and the somewhat poorly drained Dunbar soils are on higher, non-flooding positions and have clayey control sections. Eulonia soils are on similar positions but have red, clayey subsoils.  Goldsboro soils are on higher adjacent non-flooding positions and have a solum thickness greater than 60 inches.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Johns soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, have a thinner solum and contrasting textures between the Bt and C horizons at a depth of less than 40 inches."
