  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  The particle-size control section averages from 18 to 27 percent clay and from 5 to 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  These soils do not have coarse fragments.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the solum and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.  Free carbonates are absent to at least 60 inches.  Redox accumulations are in the lower part of the mollic in some pedons and are throughout the soil below the mollic.  Dominant chroma of less than 2 (or of 1 or less depending on hue) is directly below the mollic epipedon.  Aquic conditions occur above 1 foot for some time in most years.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y or is neutral in hue.  Value is 4 to 6 and chroma is 0 to 2.  The Bg horizon is typically silt loam but thin subhorizons of silty clay loam are in some pedons.  Some pedons have loam texture in the lower part of the Bg horizon below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Cg horizon has Hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y or is neutral in hue.  Value is 4 to 6 and chroma is 0 to 6.  It is commonly silt loam or silt loam stratified with silt or very fine sand or other textures containing more sand."

Beaucoup, Bridgeson, and Gorham soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Blackoar, Lummi, Sauvie, and Wapato soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 50 degrees F.  Leshara soils typically have free carbonates within 20 inches and are somewhat poorly drained with aquic conditions at 18 to 36 inches."

These soils formed primarily in silty alluvium with or without stratification of other textures below a depth of 40 inches.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 150 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1100 feet."

Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the upper part and slow in the lower part.  This soil is subject to frequent flooding of brief to long duration.  The most common months for flooding are November to May but flooding can occur after any period of heavy runoff.  This soil has an apparent seasonal high water table from 1 foot above to 1 foot below the surface for long periods in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Some areas of this soil have been drained and protected from flooding and are used for cropland.  Corn is the most common crop.  Areas subject to frequent flooding or that have not been drained are in native vegetation which consists primarily of sedges, reeds, and marsh grasses with some shrubs and trees such as elderberry, black willow, silver maple, green ash, cottonwood, and red maple. Some areas are used for pastureland."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil has been mapped on flood plains and in drains where it is subject to flooding.  It has also been mapped on terraces and lake plains where it ponds but does not flood.  These areas should be mapped 2 different series.  A new series is needed for the soils on terraces and lake basins.  It will be a Typic Endoaquoll.\nA new series is also needed for the soils mapped as the sandy substratum phase of this series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - 0 to 16 inches (Ap, A); cambic horizon - 16 to 35 inches (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, Bg4); fluventic feature - irregular decrease of organic carbon with increasing depth; aquic feature - aquic conditions above a depth of 1 foot for some time in most years and dominant chroma of 1 directly below the mollic epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0233.  Soil survey sample number is S77WI-081-007.  NSSL sample numbers are 77P2187-77P2194.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
