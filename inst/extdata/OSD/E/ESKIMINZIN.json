  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eskiminzin series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basic igneous rock. Eskiminzin soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches (356 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16.1 degrees C).",
