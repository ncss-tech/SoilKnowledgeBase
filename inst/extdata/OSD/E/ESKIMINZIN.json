The Eskiminzin soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, tuff and other extrusive igneous rocks and elevation ranges from 2,500 feet to 5,500 feet (762 to 1676.4 meters). The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 67 degrees F (13.9 to 19.4 degrees C). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm) and occurs mainly as thundershowers in July and August and rains in December and January. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days"
