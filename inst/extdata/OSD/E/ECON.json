  "OVERVIEW": "The Econ series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in residuum and alluvium derived from shale and interbedded sandstone on tablelands, hills and mountainsides.  Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches (405 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F (6 degrees C).",
