  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  The sand size is predominantly very fine sand with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Depth to carbonate accumulation ranges from 5 to 10 inches.  The moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days following the winter solstice, and is dry for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  This horizon is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Textures are clay loam and silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline and moderately calcareous to strongly calcareous."

Bluffdale soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and mesic temperature regime.  Hillfield soils have less than 18 percent clay the particle-size control section and a mesic temperature regime.  Murphy soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Richsum soils have 18 to 27 percent clay and greater than 15 percent fine sand by weight in the particle size control section and deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Econ soils are on tablelands, hills and mountainsides at elevations of 6,000 to 7,200 feet.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Econ soils formed mainly in residuum and valley side alluvium from sandstone and shale. The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The freeze-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Redcan soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Hades, Ant Flat and Manila soils have an argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon and are on the higher landscape positions."
