The ash in the Emdent soils is from the eruption of Mount Mazama. The content of ash is very high, but because of the sustained water table it is not weathered enough to meet the acid oxalate Al plus 1/2 Fe criteria for andic soil properties.\n6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The PLSS details place the location of the pedon in an area of Anders silt loam, 0 to 5 percent slopes. The type location should be investigated and potentially moved to a more appropriate location. The formatting of this OSD was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nKellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data--sample number S05WA063-006, Spokane County, Washington, pedon number 06N0193\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
