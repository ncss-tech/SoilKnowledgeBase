Bullvaro, Demner, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Camelback soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments which are sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks and are dominantly quartzite.  Chrisflat, Dogbed, Krenka, Murain, Snyderville, Softback, and Softscrabble soils are very deep.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts."

Property data in NASIS validates the superactive activity class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
