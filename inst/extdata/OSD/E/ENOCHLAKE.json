  "OVERVIEW": "The Enochlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope wash derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  The Enochlake soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
