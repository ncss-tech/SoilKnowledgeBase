  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Erakatak soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on summits or south-facing backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from volcanic rocks with surface mantles of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 80 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

Hackwood soils are fine-loamy, very deep, have thick mollic epipedons, and do not have argillic horizons.  Tusel soils are loamy-skeletal, have thick mollic epipedons, and are greater than 100 cm to bedrock."
