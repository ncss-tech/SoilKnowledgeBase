  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the O horizon ranges from 3 to 12 inches, but mean thickness is about 6 inches. Streaks of organic matter may or may not occur.  Lenses of very fine sandy material occur in places, especially in alluvial plains of major rivers.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 4 to 20 inches; maximum depth is in upland valleys.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 6 to 16 inches, and is related to the thickness of the O horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Kuskokwim soils in the same subgroup and family, the Goldstream, Saulich, Copper River, Klawasi, and Yukon soils of the same subgroup, and the Fairplay series.  The Kuskokwim soils are acid throughout.  The Goldstream and Saulich soils are highly micaceous and are not calcareous.  The Copper River soils have clayey substrata.  The Klawasi soils are clayey throughout.  The Yukon soils have stratified silty and sandy subsoils.  The Fairplay soils have higher chromas, no mottling, and bedrock at moderate depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Easley soils occur on floodplains of major rivers and in secondary drainageways.  The regolith is calcareous silty alluvium.  The climate is subarctic continental, with long cold winters and short warm summers. Mean annual precipitation is commonly less than 14 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained because of high permafrost table.  Runoff is slow to moderate.  Permeability is slow because of the presence of permafrost, but would be moderate in cleared areas where the permafrost table is deeper."

    "content": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Easley soils have been observed only along the upper Yukon River in east central Alaska.  They are probably extensive at lower elevations in that area."
