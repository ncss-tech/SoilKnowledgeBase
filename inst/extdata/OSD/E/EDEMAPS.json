  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edemaps soils are on plateaus, hills, and rock pediments. These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff, andesite, rhyolite, or basalt. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,280 to 1,740 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 280 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
