  "OVERVIEW": "The Edemaps series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Edemaps soils are on plateaus, hills, and rock pediments. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
