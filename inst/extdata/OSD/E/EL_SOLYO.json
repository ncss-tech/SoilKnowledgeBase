  "OVERVIEW": "The El Solyo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  El Solyo soils are on low alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
