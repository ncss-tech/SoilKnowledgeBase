  "OVERVIEW": "The Enentah series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Enentah soils are on glaciated mountain slopes and moraines.  Slopes range from 10 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
