Fragments range from none to less than 5 percent above the discontinuity and from 0 to 50 percent in the 2C horizon  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid to a depth of about 3 or 4 feet, and from moderately acid to neutral below this depth.\nThe A and Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons can have transitional horizons with color and texture similar to the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redoximorphic features range from none to common in shades of red, brown, yellow, olive, and gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt and 2BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 8.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and are in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Most pedons have vertical seams of silty clay loam or silt loam averaging 1 inch thick or less, between prisms.  These seams are redoximorphic depletions of iron and clay and are in various shades of gray.\nThe 2C horizons have the same range in colors as those of the 2Bt.  Texture is silty clay or clay or their channery or flaggy analogs."
