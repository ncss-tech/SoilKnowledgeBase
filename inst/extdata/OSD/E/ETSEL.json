  "OVERVIEW": "The Etsel series consists of very shallow or shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone or shale.  Etsel soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature just above the bedrock is between 50 and 59 degrees F.  Rock fragments average 35 to 55 percent in the control section but range from 15 to 65 percent.  The soils are slightly to strongly acid and acidity usually increases slightly with depth.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 7/4, 7/2, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 7/4, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/2, 5/4 4/3, 4/2.

The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 57 degrees F. Frost-free season is 90 to 250 days."
