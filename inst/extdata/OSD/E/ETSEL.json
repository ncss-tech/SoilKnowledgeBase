The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone, shale, and schist.  Up to 25 percent of the surface is rock outcrop.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 57 degrees F. Frost-free season is 90 to 250 days."
