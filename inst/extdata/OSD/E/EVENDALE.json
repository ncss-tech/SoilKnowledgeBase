  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 3 1/2 feet. Rock fragments are primarily chert except some, particularly in the lower horizons, are angular sandstone and shale. Fragments in individual horizons of the soil range from 10 to 40 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 20 to 70 percent in the lower part and C horizon. Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and is strongly acid or very strongly acid below a depth of about 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Coatings on peds are dominantly gray (N 5/0) and (10YR 5/1) to light gray (5Y 7/2). Few to many grayish and brownish mottles are common throughout the B horizon. The fine-earth fraction is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky or blocky, commonly arranged in coarse or very coarse prisms.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. The fine-earth fraction ranges from loam to clay. It is massive or has platy structure."

Cana and Coolville soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Landsdown soils have a medium acid C horizon above the lithic contact. Rarden soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Cavode soils do not have chert fragments. Tygart soils have very few or no rock fragments. Brinkerton, Caneadea, Library and Vandergrift soils are Alfisols. In addition, Brinkerton soils have a fragipan and less than 35 percent clay and Vandergrift soils have hues redder than 7.5YR. Kreamer soils do not have dominant chroma of 2 or less on faces of peds in the Bt horizon. Loysville soils have a fragipan."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 48 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 150 to 210 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The concept of Evendale in this description defines the series as somewhat poorly drained and is intended to replace Kreamer, somewhat poorly drained Variant. Soils formerly identified as Evendale will henceforth be considered a poorly drained Variant of Evendale. Clay mineralogy data are available on six pedons sampled as Evendale in Juniata, Perry and Snyder Counties, Pennsylvania. All had illitic mineralogy and were correlated as variants or taxadjuncts. There is insufficient data to warrant changing the classification of the Evendale series to an illitic mineralogy class.\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.Previous revision dates: 1/87 ART;"
