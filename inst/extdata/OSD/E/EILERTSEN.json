  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. Hue is 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y. The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay content and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silt loam with 12 to 20 percent clay. Soil reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry. Redox concentrations are below 40 inches in some pedons and are distinct grayish brown or dark brown. It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has few or common clay films. Soil reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam with 10 to 25 percent clay. Redox features are few to common, and distinct or prominent. Soil reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eilertsen soils occur on low stream terraces along major drainages in mountainous areas of the Coast Range. Elevations are 15 to 800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 7 percent. These soils formed in mixed silty alluvium derived from sedimentary and volcanic rock types. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The frost-free period is 110 to 220 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kauppi, Kirkendall, McNulty, Meda, Nekoma, Quosantana, Treharne, and Zyzzug soils. All of these soils lack an argillic horizon and are on flood plains except Treharne soils which are moderately well drained and Zyzzug soils which are poorly drained. Both of these soils occur on low stream terraces. Meda soils are fine-loamy and occur on alluvial fans."

Native vegetation is Douglas fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, red alder, cascade Oregongrape, common snowberry, red huckleberry, swordfern and forbs. In addition, tanoak, California laurel, and Pacific rhododendron occur in the more southern reaches of the Coast Range in Curry County, Oregon."
