    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are rangeland or improved pasture with a few cultivated areas. The native plant community is a savannah with scattered post oak, blackjack oak, and elm trees with ground cover of medium and tall native grasses. Present vegetation is a fairly dense cover of oak trees, yaupon, American beautyberry and hawthorn with shade tolerant grasses such as longleaf uniola. Many areas have been cultivated in the past. These old cropland fields are being used for rangeland or have been established to bermudagrass, bahiagrass or other improved pasture grasses. A few small areas have been planted to loblolly pine. Old fields being used for rangeland are typically producing low quality perennial grasses, annuals grasses, forbs and some fields are being invaded by mesquite."

    "content": "SERIES ESTABLISHED: Freestone County, Texas; 1986. The Edge series was originally established in Brazos County, Texas in 1955. In May, 1963 the series was placed on the inactive list and the soils were included with the similar Axtell series. The Axtell soils are members of a fine, smectitic, thermic family of Udertic Paleustalfs. Axtell soils are typically on terraces or in valley fill positions and have a solum thicker than 152 cm (60 in)and with vertic properties. The re-defined Edge series has a concept similar to the original series established in Brazos County."
