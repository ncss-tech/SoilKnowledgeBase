  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 40 inches and typically corresponds to the depth to contrasting sand or sand and gravel layers.  Rock fragments, mainly rounded gravel, range from 0 to 30 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the substratum.  Unless limed, the soil ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has dominant hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have a subhorizon with hue of 7.5YR in the upper part of the horizon.  The Bw horizon has redoximorphic features above a depth of 24 inches.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction with less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  The Bw horizon has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.  Some pedons have a sandy loam Bw subhorizon or BC horizon less than 5 inches thick just above the 2C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, and value and chroma of 3 to 6. In some pedons the horizon does not have redoximorphic features.  The horizon is commonly stratified sand and gravel.  Texture of individual layers ranges from coarse sand to fine sand to loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ellington soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on glaciofluvial landforms.  Slope commonly is 0 to 8 percent , but the range includes 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loamy over stratified sandy and gravelly outwash derived from reddish brown sedimentary rocks and basalt.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 120 to 195 days."

Bash soils are somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  Berlin soils are finer-textured soils on glaciolacustrine terraces.  Cheshire, Ludlow, Wapping, Watchaug and Wethersfield soils are soils on nearby till plains, hills, and drumlins.  Hartford soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Manchester and Penwood soils are excessively drained and sandy-skeletal. Branford soils are well drained.  Raypol, Raynham and Walpole soils are poorly drained and are in low areas."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision reflects a change in soil classification (8th Edition of the Keys) and general updating.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 26 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\n3.  Aquic feature - low chroma iron depletions features are within a depth of 24 inches from the surface (Bw horizon).\n4.  Strongly contrasting particle-size classes - the control section is coarse-loamy above a depth of 26 inches and is sandy or sandy-skeletal below 26 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
