  "OVERVIEW": "The Ekim series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from limestone.  Ekim soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
