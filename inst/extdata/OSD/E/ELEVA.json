  "STATES": "IL,IA,MI,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eleva series consists of moderately deep, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 50 to 102 centimeters of loamy deposits over sandstone.  These soils are on undulating to very steep slopes on uplands and on lake terraces. Slope ranges from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
