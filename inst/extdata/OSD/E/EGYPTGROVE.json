  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Egyptgrove soils are on ridge tops, shoulder slopes and side slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. These soils formed in silty colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from decomposing post-Ordivician age mudstone. Elevations are commonly 700 to 1500 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 45 inches."

Poynor soils are loamy-skeletal over clayey and are on side slopes. Scholten and Tonti soils have fragipans and are on similar positions. Tick soils are fine textured and are also on similar landscape positions as Egyptgrove."
