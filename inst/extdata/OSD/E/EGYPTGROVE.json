  "OVERVIEW": "The Egyptgrove series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from decomposing post-Ordivician age mudstone. These soils are on gently to strongly sloping uplands. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
