  "OVERVIEW": "The Edgway series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foothills and mountains. These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources.  Edgway soils have moderately slow permeability.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
