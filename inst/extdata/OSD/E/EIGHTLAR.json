The mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 56 degrees F.   These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 65 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The 10- to 40 inch control section averages 55 to 65 percent clay and 40 to 80 percent total rock fragments of which 20 to 50 percent are cobbles and stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and dry, chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 2 through 4 dry.   It is extremely stony clay or very stony clay loam with 15 to 25 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 15 to 30 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist, 2 through 4 dry.  It is extremely stony clay or very stony clay with 55 to 65 percent clay.  It has 20 to 30 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 15 to 30 percent stones.  Some pedons may have few to common clay films below 29 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is extremely stony clay or very stony clay with 55 to 65 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, 15 to 30 percent stones, and 0 to 35 percent soft rock fragments."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from peridotite or serpentinite bedrock.  Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 30 to 70 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 170 days."
