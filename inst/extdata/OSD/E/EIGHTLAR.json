  "OVERVIEW": "The Eightlar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from periodotite and serpentinite rocks.  Eightlar soils are on alluvial fans, broad ridgetops, and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 65 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.

It is extremely stony clay or very stony clay loam with 15 to 25 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 15 to 30 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist, 2 through 4 dry.
