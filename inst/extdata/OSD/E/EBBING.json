  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rounded gravel and cobbles of sandstone, chert, and quartzite range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon, and 0 to 35 percent in the B horizon, and 5 to 50 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral throughout, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is commonly mottled in shades of gray, brown, and red.  The Bt is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8 and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cg horizon (here intended to include a C horizon where present) is neutral or has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8 and chroma of 0 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam and silt loam in the fine-earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Athol, Bolton, Bookwood, Brecknock, Carpenter, Cateache, Culleoka, Door, Dormont, Duffield, Dumfries, Frondorf, Grayford, Greencreek (Tentative), Hayter, Lamotte, Legore, Loudonville, Manassas, Mechanicsburg, Morrison, Myersville, Neshaminy, Oatlands, Panorama, Penn, Ryder, Spriggs, Sudley, Washington, Weedmark (Tentative), Westmoreland, Wheeling, and Williamsburg series in the same family.  Athol and Manassas soils have Bt horizons with hues redder than 7.5YR.  The Bookwood, Culleoka, Frondorf, Loudonville and Spriggs soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The Brecknock, Dumfries, Legore, Myersville, and Westmoreland soils have solum thickness less than 40 inches.  The Legore soils, in addition, have saprolite in the series control section.  The Cataeche, Oatlands, Penn and Ryder soils have Bt horizons redder than 7.5YR and depth to bedrock less than 40 inches.  The Door soils contain shale fragments and are dry for longer periods of time.  The Dormont soils are weathered from non-acid shale and siltstones and contain more silt in the Bt horizon.  The Duffield soils have clay minerals dominated by illite and vermiculite.  The Greencreek and Weedmark soils are dry for longer periods and have a cooler soil temperature.  The Lamotte soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizons.  Mechanicburg soils have mixed rock fragments from glaciers and have cooler soil temperature.  The Morrison and Sudley soils do not have (water) rounded coarse fragments in the particle size control section.  The Panorama soils have redder hues in the Bt horizons and paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Washington soils have angular fragments of chert, quartz, and gneiss in the solum.  The Bolton, Carpenter, Grayford, Hayter, Neshaminy and Wheeling soils do not have low chroma mottles in the argillic horizon.  Williamburg soils has a solum greater than 60 inches and a silty mantle from loess 12 to 24 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ebbing soils are on low stream terraces along major streams and rivers subject to rare flooding. Slope gradients are most commonly 2 to 7 percent slopes, but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial materials from limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale, and quartzite of Cambrian, Ordivician, Silurian, and Devonian ages in the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys MLRA.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F."

Frederick and Shottower soils have more clay in the subsoil, are well drained, and are on uplands.  Marbie soils have a fragipan and are on colluvial benches.  Wyrick soils are well drained and are on colluvial benches.  Mongle (proposed) soils are wetter and are on similar landscapes.  Wheeling soils are well drained and are on similar landscapes.
