  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Embudo soils are on fan terraces ranging from 5,000 to 6,000 feet in elevation.  They occupy side slopes and depressional areas adjacent to arroyo channels but are not flooded or overflowed.  The parent material is mixed alluvium from coarse-grained granitic rocks.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The annual temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 140 to 180 days.  Annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches which is received during July through September and December through March."
