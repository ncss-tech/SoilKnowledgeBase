  "OVERVIEW": "The Embudo series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite and are on fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid below 20 inches.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

They occupy side slopes and depressional areas adjacent to arroyo channels but are not flooded or overflowed.  The parent material is mixed alluvium from coarse-grained granitic rocks.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The annual temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 140 to 180 days.  Annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches which is received during July through September and December through March."

(Bw horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nThis series was reclassified from thermic to mesic temperature regime based on a better understanding of the soil temperature regimes in New Mexico. The series was reclassified from Orthents to Cambids based on the redistribution of calcium carbonate."
