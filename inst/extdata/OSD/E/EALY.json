Texture is loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 in the upper part and hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 in the lower part.  Some pedons are mottled with shades of brown and gray below 25 inches.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam except some pedons have thin subhorizons or strata of loamy fine sand or silt loam.  Some pedons have a buried A horizon below a depth of 25 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Gladden is the only series in the same family. Ennis, Neubert, Ochlockonee, Pope, Philo, Sewanee, and Toccoa series are in closely related families.  Gladden soils have more than 35 percent chert fragments in a horizon between 20 and 40 inches.  Ennis and Neubert soils are fine-loamy and are thermic.  Ochlockonee and Toccoa soils do not have cambic horizons and are thermic. Pope and Philo soils have mixed mineralogy and Philo soils also have mottles of 2 chroma or less within a depth of 24 inches.  Sewanee soils have mottles of 2 chroma or less within a depth of 24 inches."
