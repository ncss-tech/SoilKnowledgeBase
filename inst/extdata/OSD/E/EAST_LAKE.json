Duel and Ishpeming soils are underlain by bedrock at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Hartwick soils contain less than 25 percent gravel below 102 cm (40 inches). Karlin, Rousseau, and Rubicon, soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the series control section. Kiva soils have more than 10 percent cobbles in the lower part of the series control section. Sayner soils do not have carbonates within the control section. Sultz soils are underlain with stratified materials."
