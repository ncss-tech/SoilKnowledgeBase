  "OVERVIEW": "The East Lake series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly outwash on outwash plains, stream terraces, lake terraces, lake basins, deltas, eskers, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
