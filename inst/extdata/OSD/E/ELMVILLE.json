  "OVERVIEW": "The Elmville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy glaciolacustrine sediments over mostly calcareous clayey glaciolacustrine sediments on lake plains. These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper material and slow permeability in the underlying sediments.  They have slopes of 0 to 3 percent in gradient.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The upper sediment is 20 to 40 inches thick.  It has a non-carbonate clay content of less than 18 percent and content of fine sand and coarser particles is typically 15 to 50 percent.  The 2C horizon has 35 to 70 percent clay.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It typically is a fine sandy loam, loam, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam but loamy fine sand and sandy loam are also in the range.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It usually has redoximorphic features in some to all parts.  It is loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It has 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe remaining part of the C horizon in the upper sediment has 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has redoximorphic features in some to all parts.  It is very fine sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  It has thin strata with coarser texture in a few pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has faint, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  It typically is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay, but has thin strata of coarse texture in some pedons.
