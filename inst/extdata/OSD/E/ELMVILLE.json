  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The calcic horizon begins within 16 inches of the surface.  The upper sediment is 20 to 40 inches thick.  It has a non-carbonate clay content of less than 18 percent and content of fine sand and coarser particles is typically 15 to 50 percent.  The 2C horizon has 35 to 70 percent clay.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It typically is a fine sandy loam, loam, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam but loamy fine sand and sandy loam are also in the range.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It usually has redoximorphic features in some to all parts.  It is loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It has 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe remaining part of the C horizon in the upper sediment has 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has redoximorphic features in some to all parts.  It is very fine sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  It has thin strata with coarser texture in a few pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has faint, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  It typically is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay, but has thin strata of coarse texture in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elmville soils have plane or slightly convex slopes on glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments consisting of a 20 to 40 inch mantle of coarse-loamy sediments over clayey sediments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches, and mean annual air temperature from 38 to 46 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Elmville soils are the dominant soils in their region of occurrence.  Donaldson, Wyndmere and Wheatville soils are associated in some areas.  Donaldson soils do not have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface.  Wheatville soils have a coarse-silty upper mantle.  Wyndmere soils do not have a clayey 2C horizon within a depth of 40 inches."

Most areas of Elmville soils were previously included with the Grimstad or Wheatville soils in mapping.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
