The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The depth to bedrock (paralithic contact) ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 20 to 28 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 moist in the upper part and 3 or 4 in the lower part, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist but ranging to 4 in the lower part of the thicker sola, and 3 or 4 dry. It is silty clay or clay with 40 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent partially weathered gravel.\nThe BC horizon commonly has hue of 7.5YR but ranges to 5YR, has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It has 30 to 50 percent partially weathered rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ead soils are on smooth, convex uplands in the Coast Range of Oregon. The soils are at 400 to 1,000 feet elevation and the slopes range from about 5 to 60 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from tuffaceous siltstone and sandstone from the Nestucca formation and micaceous siltstone and sandstone from the Yamhill formation. The climate is subhumid with cool, moist winter, and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 70 inches.  Mean July temperature is 64 degrees F.; mean January temperature is 37 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 145 to 200 days."

Knappa soils have thick A horizons and moderately fine textured B horizons. Grande Ronde soils are imperfectly drained. Peavine soils have 5YR or 2.5YR hue and have Bt horizons.  Hembre soils have moderately fine textured B horizons, and have a lithic contact of basalt rock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
