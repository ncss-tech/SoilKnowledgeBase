Content of rock fragments range from 10 to 45 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Content of rock fragments range from 36 to 75 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured consolidated serpentinite bedrock."

They formed in residuum that weathered from serpentinite.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 68 to 134 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F."

A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nEl Descanso soils formed in the Serpentinite Formation (Ks).\nEl Descanso soils are in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
