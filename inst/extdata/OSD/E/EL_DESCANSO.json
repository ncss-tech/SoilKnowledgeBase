  "REVDATE": "02/2008",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Descanso series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils on side slopes and summits of mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in residuum that weathered from serpentine.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 79 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.",

A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nEl Descanso soils formed in the Serpentinite Formation (Ks).\nEl Descanso soils are in MLRA 270."
