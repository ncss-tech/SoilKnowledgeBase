    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fan terraces around bases of steep mountain slopes.   These fans are dissected by numerous ephemeral stream washes that are several feet lower in relief.  Slopes are usually long and range from 1 to 15 percent.  The parent material is composed of mixed alluvium derived from granite monzonite, rhyolite, andesite and other acid and basic igneous rocks.  The mean annual air temperature ranges between 59 to 70 degrees F."
