  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Elon series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on floodplains.  They formed in calcareous silty alluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees and mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.",

These soils contain free carbonates throughout the control section but the A or Ap horizon is noncalcareous in some pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.\nIn some pedons a buried A horizon is present below 40 inches.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam."
