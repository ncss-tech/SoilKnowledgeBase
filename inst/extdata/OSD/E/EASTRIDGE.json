  "OVERVIEW": "The Eastridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash influenced alluvium and/or colluvium derived from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes, hills and landslides.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
