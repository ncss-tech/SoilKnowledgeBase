  "OVERVIEW": "The Elias series consists of very deep, sodium affected, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and fan alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. These soils are on knolls, fan terraces and fan remnants of valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
