The typical pedon lacks clear evidence of an erratic organic matter decrease with depth or a content of organic matter in excess of 0.5 percent at a depth of 125 centimeters below the surface, but other evidence suggests that the series is best classified in a Cumulic subgroup.\nCation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample 02IA003001, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory.\nSome pedons have a Btg horizon but these do not have the clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska--pedon 02IA003001\nLaboratory data--Iowa State University, Ames, IA--many pedons\nOSD type location: Pedon Number 1999IA107016\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
