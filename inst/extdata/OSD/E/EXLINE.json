  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Salts are above horizons with accumulations of carbonate and are within a depth of 16 inches. Exchangeable sodium percentage exceeds 15 percent above a depth of 16 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 8 to 28 inches.\nThe A horizon, where present, has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam but is silty clay in some pedons where cultivated.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  The Ap horizon is 6 to 10 inches thick and is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist.  It commonly is silt loam but in some pedons it is loam or silty clay loam and is slightly acid or neutral.  When cultivated the E horizon commonly is absent.\nThe Btn and Btnz horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam but is clay loam in some pedons.  Clay content is between 35 and 55 percent.  In most pedons the lower part of this horizon contains few or common nests of gypsum and other salts. Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Btknz, Bkz, and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. They typically are silty clay, clay or silty clay loam but is clay loam in some pedons. They are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Most pedons have few to many accumulations of carbonate and salts. Some pedons have a Bkyz horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and typically is varved with thin strata of very fine sand to clay.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It has few or common, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate. Some pedons have sandy material or loamy glacial till below depths of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adger, Ferney, Mekinock, and Rhoades series.  Adger and Rhoades soils have E horizons with chroma of 2 and are drier in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Ferney soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser throughout, and formed in glacial till.  Mekinock soils have a paralithic contact of shale bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Exline soils are nearly level to level on flats of the glacial lake plain and terraces.  Microdepressions are common in most areas. Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous lacustrine and alluvial deposits of silt, fine sand, and clay.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 24 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer.  Growing season is about 120 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2800."

Aberdeen soils do not have columnar structure in the Btn horizon and have tonguing of A horizon material into the Btn horizon. Aberdeen and Nahon soils are on broad smooth flats on nearby landscapes. Beotia, Harmony, and Putney soils are on slightly higher positions and do not have natric horizons. In addition, Beotia and Putney soils are fine-silty. Heil soils are in closed depressions. They are poorly drained. Nahon soils have salts below 16 inches and have thicker sola. Ojata soils are on slightly lower positions. They do not have a Bt horizon and have a strongly saline, calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches."
