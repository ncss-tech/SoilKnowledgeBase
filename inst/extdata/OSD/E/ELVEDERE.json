  "OVERVIEW": "The Elvedere series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments.  Elvedere soils are on terraces, terrace escarpments and plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for more than half the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Depth to the Bk horizons is 7 to 18 inches. The particle-size control section is less than 5 percent coarse fragments, 35 to 45 percent clay, and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  Some pedons have a stony surface layer.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist or dry.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It has 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate."
