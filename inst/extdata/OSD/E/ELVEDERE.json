These soils are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for more than half the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Depth to the Bk horizons is 7 to 18 inches. The particle-size control section is less than 5 percent coarse fragments, 35 to 45 percent clay, and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  Some pedons have a stony surface layer.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist or dry.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It has 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate."

These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments.  Elevations are 1,100 to 2,600 feet.  The climate is semi-arid, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."
