  "OVERVIEW": "The Elvick series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from hard coarse and fine grained igneous rock. These soils are on alluvial fans and drainageways in mountains.  Slopes are 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
