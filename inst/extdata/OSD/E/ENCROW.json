Aris soils are somewhat poorly drained and contain more total sand in the upper part of the solum.  Derly soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Evadale soils do not have dark coatings on surfaces of peds.  Mowata and Wrightsville soils do not have red mottles in the argillic horizons.  Caddo, Guyton, Kinder, Fountain, Basile, Calhoun, Frost, and Gilbert soils have fine- silty particle size control sections."
