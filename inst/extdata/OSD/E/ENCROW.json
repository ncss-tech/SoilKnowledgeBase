Aris soils are somewhat poorly drained and contain more total sand in the upper part of the solum.  Derly soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Evadale soils do not have dark coatings on surfaces of peds.  Mowata and Wrightsville soils do not have red mottles in the argillic horizons.  Caddo, Guyton, Kinder, Fountain, Basile, Calhoun, Frost, and Gilbert soils have fine- silty particle size control sections."

They formed in mixed loess and alluvium over clayey deposits of Pleistocene Age.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 64 inches."

The very poorly drained fluid clayey Barbary soils are in continuously flooded swamps.  The somewhat poorly drained Deerford and Verdun soils and the poorly drained Springfield soils are on nearly level flats. Deerford and Verdun soils have a natric horizons.  Springfield soils have higher chroma colors in the lower part of the Bt horizon."
