  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to weathered shale ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The surface layer when mixed to a depth of 7 inches meets the requirements for a mollic epipedon.  It ranges from 6 to 10 inches thick.  Base saturation is 75 percent or less in some part above the paralithic contact.  The series control section is channery loam with channery or channery rock fragments.  Hard bedrock occurs at depth of about 38 inches in some pedons.  Quartzite stones and cobbles are on the surface and in the upper part of the sola in a few pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mainly channery loam but ranges to channery silt loam with 5 to 20 percent shale fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It ranges from channery loam or channery silt loam or channery silty clay loam.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elder Hollow soils are on mountain side slopes, ridges and spur ridges at elevations of 7,500 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from quartz diorite porphyry and shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches.  The frost free season is 30 to 60 days."
