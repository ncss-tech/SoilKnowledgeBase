    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Base saturation (sum) is 60 to 75 percent in the surface and upper part of the subsoil and can range to over 75 percent in the lower part of the subsoil.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The solum and depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 36 inches.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 20 to 27 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  A thin 1 to 3 inch thick C horizon is present in some pedons above the bedrock.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  The darker value and chroma occur in the upper part.  It contains 35 to 60 percent rock fragments consisting of gravel, cobbles and stones.  Glass content is estimated to be 5 to 30 percent.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 0.4 to 0.8.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It contains 35 to 70 percent rock fragments consisting of gravel and cobbles."
