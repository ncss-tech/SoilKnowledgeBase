These soils formed in glacial till derived from granite with an admixture  of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 80 inches.  Average January  temperature is about 32 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.  Mean annual air temperature is 43 to 44 degrees F.
