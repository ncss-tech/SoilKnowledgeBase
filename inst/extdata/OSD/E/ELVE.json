  "STATES": "CO,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Elve series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or till derived from igneous rocks. These soils are on mountain slopes, hills, moraines, or alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 85 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
