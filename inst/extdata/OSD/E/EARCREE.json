Cinderspring soils have moderate permeability and have average annual soil temperature of less than 38 degrees F.  Coutis soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments throughout and have textures of fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the control section.  Gardner's Fork soils have an O horizon and have 20 to 35 percent shale fragments in the control section.  Hailman soils have O horizons.  Moonlight soils have 20 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser particles in the control section.  Naz soils have an O horizon and a udic moisture regime. razorba soils are calcareous throughout.  Shook soils have bedrock at a depth of 30 to 40 inches.  Skyway soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Tosp soils are udic."

They formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum weathered from granite, andesite, or quartzitic metamorphic rocks.  Elevation is 5,000 to 10,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches, and the average annual temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 75 days."
