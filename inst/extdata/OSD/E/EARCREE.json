  "OVERVIEW": "The Earcree series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum weathered from granite, andesite, or quartzitic metamorphic rocks.  Earcree soils are on mountains and foothills.  Slopes range from  2 to 60 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
