Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BA horizon, where present, and the upper part of the Bt and Btg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Coatings on peds have chroma of 1 or 2 where the matrix chroma in the BA or Bt horizons are more than 2 in interiors of peds. Iron accumulations are in shades of brown and iron depletions are in shades of gray. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 through 6; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam with iron depletions in shades of gray. Most peds are coated or partly coated with clay films with chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Content of calcium carbonate concretions 1 to 5 cm in diameter ranges from 1 to 10 percent in some subhorizon of the Bt horizon. The Bt horizon averages less than 10 percent sand that is dominantly very fine sand, and has 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe C horizon is variegated in shades of gray and brown. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Acy soils have color values of 2 to 4 in the upper part of the Bt horizon. Amagon and Dundee soils contain more than 15 percent sand that is dominantly very fine sand in the B horizon and are acid throughout the solum. Fred soils have chroma of 3 to 6 in the upper part of the Bt horizon. Fountain soils have dominant chroma of 1 to a depth of 30 inches and have a glossic horizon. Galvez and Routon soils do not contain carbonate concretions in the solum. Hebert soils have redder hue in the argillic horizon. Kurk soils are more acid and do not have carbonate concretions throughout the solum.  McGehee soils have a 2B horizon with redder hue. Patoutville soils have red iron accumulations and do not have carbonate concretions in the solum."

The morphology and moisture regimes are significantly different from associated soils having natric horizons. It is speculated that the genesis is in some way related to that of the associated soils having natric horizons. This soil formerly would have been classified in the Gray-Brown Podzolic great soil group.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
