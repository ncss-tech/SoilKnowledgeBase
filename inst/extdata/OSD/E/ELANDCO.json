    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizons range from 20 to 50 inches thick.  They have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizons are silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have finer or coarser textures in the upper 10 inches.  The A1 and A2 horizons are moderately acid through slightly alkaline.  The A3 horizon is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons contain a few brownish or yellowish mottles in the C horizon.  The C horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam.  Some pedons contain strata of coarser or finer texture than the control section.  The C horizon is neutral through moderately alkaline.  Stratification ranges from very slight to distinct."

The Bergstrom soils are calcareous throughout.  The Bigetty and Irran soils occur in arid to semiarid moisture regimes.  The Port soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder throughout.  The Asa, Spur and Velow soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  The Bosque, Gageby, Gowen and Whitesboro soils have fine-loamy control sections.  The Frio soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in alluvium of medium and moderately fine particle size.  Unless protected, flooding occurs at intervals ranging from one to two times each year to once in 4 to 10 years.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 40 inches, and the Thornthwaite P-E indices from 36 to 64.  Frost free days range from 190 to 240.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1500 feet."
