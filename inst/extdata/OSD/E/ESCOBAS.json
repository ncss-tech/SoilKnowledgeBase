The Hebbronville series has an ochric epipedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 28 to 79 cm (11 to 31 in) (Bt horizons).\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in) (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon: 28 to 127 cm (11 to 50 in) (Bt horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis, calcium carbonate equivalent, sieve analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 3 pedons. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from geographically associated soils.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ten Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
