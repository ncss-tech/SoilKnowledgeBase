  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Escobas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sands over calcareous loamy alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on the vegetated sand sheet. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 23 degress C (73 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).",

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from geographically associated soils.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ten Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
