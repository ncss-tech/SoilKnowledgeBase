    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 3 percent by volume in the control section and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon.  These consist of black or brown iron and manganese concretions and feldspar fragments.  The soil ranges from moderately acid through neutral, unless limed.\nThe A and E horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are also neutral and include chroma of 4.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is mottled with high chroma mottles. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is mottled with high chroma mottles.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam or clay.  Slickensides are on horizontal faces of peds in some pedons.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is mottled with high chroma mottles.  The BC horizon is sandy clay, clay loam, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 2 or is mottled with colors in shades of gray, brown, and olive.  It is sandy clay loam or sandy loam, or less commonly sandy clay or clay.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 2, it is neutral, or it is mottled in shades of gray, brown, and olive.  It is weathered bedrock that crushes to sandy loam or sandy clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elbert soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland flats, depressions, and drainageways with slope gradients mostly between 0 to 5 percent. Drainageways are subject to frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding events with little or no deposition or erosion. They formed in local alluvium over residuum. The regolith is clayey residuum from dark colored basic rocks such as greenstone, diorite, hornblende, gneiss, dacite, or local colluvium of similar origin.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 53 degrees to 59 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 45 inches."
