  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Elbert series are deep and poorly drained with slow to very slow permeability.  They formed in local alluvium over residuum of greenstone, diorite, hornblende, gneiss, and other basic dark colored rocks.  These soils are on upland flats, in depressions, and along drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Drainageways are subject to frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding events with little or no deposition or erosion. They formed in local alluvium over residuum. The regolith is clayey residuum from dark colored basic rocks such as greenstone, diorite, hornblende, gneiss, dacite, or local colluvium of similar origin.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 53 degrees to 59 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 45 inches."
