    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 12 to 21 inches.  (2Bt horizon)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches).  (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 30 to 53 centimeters (12 to 21 inches).  (2Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact: The contact with shale at 97 centimeters (38 inches). (2Cr horizon)\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe assignment of the CEC activity class is supported by KSSL sample number 79P0321 (pedon 79KS143002).\nThe shale bedrock is often a mixture of material that does not slake (paralithic material) and that does slake (densic material).  With some of the material not slaking it was determined to leave the horizonation as Cr rather than changing it Cd.\nOther features: The mottles with chroma of 2 or less are inherited from the shale, and are not considered an indication of wetness.\nLRR=H\nAdded \"sandy and/or clayey\"  to the second sentence of the first paragraph.  Added  \"They may have colluvium, or loess in the upper profile.\nAdded wet consistence to all horizons in the typical pedon.\nRemoved all series that were in a different family.\nIncluded Diagnostic horizons and features in the \"Remarks\"\n05/00 - From Soil Interpretation Record added Clay Content and Sand Content to Range in Characteristics and added Frost-free period to Geographic Setting.\n10/2013 DJK - Added in metric units. Changed MAP in intro from 29 to 31 inches. Changed activity class in classification from superactive to active (added statement in remarks stating supported by lab data). Added lab sample numbers. Added quad and lat/long to type location. Added MAST ranges. Added BA ranges in RIC. Added clay loam to A horizon. Added sand contents, pararock fragments, and redox to RIC. Added elevation and precipatiation pattern to geographic setting. Updated parent material, landform, MAP, MAAT, and FFD to geographic setting. Updated competing series and geographically associated soils. Changed Ksat from very slow to low and runoff to only high. Updated Distribution and Extent. Updated Additional Data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Analysis from this type location was made by the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory.  Pedon ID 79KS143002, sample numbers 79P01667 to 79P01672.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
