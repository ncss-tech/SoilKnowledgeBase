    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 6 to 52 inches. Rock fragments are typically absent, but up to 3 percent may be present.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons have chroma of 2 in the lower part. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Structure is weak granular, subangular blocky, or platy, and consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid. A few thin lamellae are present in some pedons. Some pedons do not have a B horizon.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon. It has properties similar to the Bw and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. The material is massive or single grain, or structure is weak platy. Consistence is loose to friable. Some pedons have subhorizons up to 12 inches thick that contain up to 15 percent rock fragments."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Algansee, Altmar, Birchwood, Brems, Brockatonorton, Deerfield, Fortress, Livonia, Meckling, Morocco, Ottokee, Partridge, Tedrow, and Zaborosky series are members of the same family. Algansee soils have an irregular decrease of organic matter in the series control section. Altmar soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the series particle size control section. Birchwood soils have densic contact within 38 inches. Brems soils typically have a thicker solum and are strongly acid in the lower part of the series control section. Brockatonorton soils have a buried organic horizon within the series control section. Deerfield soils contain more medium and coarse sand in the lower part of the control section. Fortress are less acidic in the B horizon. Meckling soils are slightly or moderately alkaline in the series control section. Livonia soils have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 60 cm. Morocco soils have redoximorphic features of 2 or less in the upper 15 inches of the series control section. Ottokee soils have lamellae in the lower part of the series control section. Partridge soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Tedrow soils have redoximorphic features of 2 or less in the upper 20 inches of the series control section. Zaborosky soils have a buried surface within the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elnora soils are on beach ridges and relict longshore bars on glacial lake plains and associated deltas of Wisconsin age. They formed in water sorted or windblown deposits dominated by fine sand with a significant amount of very fine sand. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F, mean annual precipitation from 28 to 45 inches, and mean growing season from 120 to 180 days."

Agawam, Colonie, Merrimac, Oakville and Plainfield soils are better drained. Amboy, Arkport, Collamer, Dunkirk, Niagara, Williamson, and Wallington soils are on nearby landscapes and formed in finer textured deposits. Junius and Stafford soils are more poorly drained. Ninigret soils have a cambic horizon."

Soils previously classified as Deerfield soils which are dominated by fine sand are within the range of Elnora soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Aquic conditions - as evidenced by low chroma matrix with redoximorphic features in the zone from 32 to 72 inches (Cg1 and Cg2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
