  "OVERVIEW": "The Elnora series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy glacial lake, eolian, and deltaic sediments. They are primarily on beach ridges and relict longshore bars on lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. The mean annual air temperature is 9.2 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is 975 millimeters.",

Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons have chroma of 2 in the lower part. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Structure is weak granular, subangular blocky, or platy, and consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid. A few thin lamellae are present in some pedons. Some pedons do not have a B horizon.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon. It has properties similar to the Bw and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. The material is massive or single grain, or structure is weak platy. Consistence is loose to friable.

Algansee soils have an irregular decrease of organic matter in the series control section. Altmar soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the series particle size control section. Birchwood soils have densic contact within 96 centimeters. Brems soils typically have a thicker solum and are strongly acid in the lower part of the series control section. Brockatonorton soils have a buried organic horizon within the series control section. Deerfield soils contain more medium and coarse sand in the lower part of the control section. Fortress are less acidic in the B horizon. Meckling soils are slightly or moderately alkaline in the series control section. Livonia soils have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 60 centimeters. Morocco soils have redoximorphic features of 2 or less in the upper 40 centimeters of the series control section. Ottokee soils have lamellae in the lower part of the series control section. Partridge soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 centimeters. Tedrow soils have redoximorphic features of 2 or less in the upper 50 centimeters of the series control section. Zaborosky soils have a buried surface within the series control section."

Agawam, Colonie, Merrimac, Oakville and Plainfield soils are better drained. Amboy, Arkport, Collamer, Dunkirk, Niagara, Williamson, and Wallington soils are on nearby landscapes and formed in finer textured deposits. Junius and Stafford soils are more poorly drained. Ninigret soils have a cambic horizon."

Soils previously classified as Deerfield soils which are dominated by fine sand are within the range of Elnora soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (Ap horizon).\nb. Aquic conditions - as evidenced by low chroma matrix with redoximorphic features in the zone from 81 to 180 centimeters (Cg1 and Cg2 horizons)."
