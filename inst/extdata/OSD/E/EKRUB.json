The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 56 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand, and averages 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist."

The soils formed in eolian sands overlying a lime-silica cemented duripan.  Ekrub soils occur in an arid climate with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual July temperature is 76 degrees F., the mean annual January temperature is 29 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 210 days."
