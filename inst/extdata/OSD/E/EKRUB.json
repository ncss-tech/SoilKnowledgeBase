  "OVERVIEW": "The Ekrub series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian sands overlying a lime-silica indurated duripan.  Ekrub soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the duripan ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Ekrub soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 inches and the top of the duripan.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 56 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand, and averages 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist."
