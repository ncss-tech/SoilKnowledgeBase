  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are typically effervescent to the surface, but may be leached to 10 inches in some pedons.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 55 percent clay and 10 to 20 percent fine and coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Cracks .25 to .75 inches wide extend from the surface through the Bw horizon in some pedons when the soils are dry, but slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates do not occur in any horizon.  The base of the cambic horizon is at depths of 11 to 23 inches.  The moisture control section is usually moist in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is clay loam, loam, clay or silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay. It is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.  It has 3 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent which typically decreases with depth.  It is slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Electrical conductivity is less than 4 millimhos per centimeter.  A C horizon occurs below the Bk horizon in some pedons."

Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
