  "OVERVIEW": "The Eep series consists of well drained, very deep soils that formed in colluvium from volcanic ash and welded tuff.  They are on breaks and scarps.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 6 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
