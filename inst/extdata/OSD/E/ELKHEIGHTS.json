These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 19 to 25 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and averages 5 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  The depth to the very gravelly dense glacial till layer is 45 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 15 to 19 inches thick, organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent.  Although dark colors occur below the mollic, the organic carbon content is less than 1 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe BAt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bt4 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It has 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe 3Cd horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is a dense glacial till that breaks to a very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  The upper part is massive or platy."
