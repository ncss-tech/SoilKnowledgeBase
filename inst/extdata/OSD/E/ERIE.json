  "OVERVIEW": "The Erie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till. They have a fragipan at depths of 25 to 53 cm (10 to 21 in) below the soil surface. These soils are of uniform slope, and are on footslopes and broad divides in uplands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan, and moderately low in the fragipan and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 1080 mm (42.5 in).",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 76 to 147 cm (30 to 58 in). Depth to carbonates ranges from 89 to 165 cm (35 to 65 in). Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 25 to 53 cm (10 to 21 in). Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 in). Rock fragments, mostly channers, gravel, cobbles or flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent above the fragipan and from 15 to 60 percent in the Bx and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry value is 6 or more. It is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction or their gravelly or channery analogues.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have an A horizon 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in) thick, with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction or their gravelly or channery analogues. It has subangular blocky or platy structure, and friable or firm consistence. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a B horizon with hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is similar to the E horizon.  An E horizon underlies the B horizon in some pedons. Some sub horizons within 76 cm (30 in) of the surface are dominated by chroma of 3 or more.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction or their gravelly to very channery analogues. Consistence is firm or very firm and the material is slightly brittle or brittle. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline, and is neutral within a depth of 102 cm (40 in).\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is similar to the Bx horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction or their gravelly to very channery analogues. The C horizon has plate or prismatic-like divisions, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Volusia and Wiscoy series. Volusia soils are in general more acid in the solum and do not have free carbonates within a depth of 165 cm (65 in). Wiscoy soils are underlain with silty lacustrine deposits in the lower subsoil and substratum.\nThe Chippewa, Dalton, Morris, Norchip, Ontusia, Ravenna, Rexford, Scriba, and Venango series are similar soils in related families. Chippewa soils lack a layer, within a depth of 6 to 30 in that has 50 percent or more high chroma colors (3 or more with redoximorphic features or 2 or more if redoximorphic features are lacking) either in the matrix or as redox features. Dalton soils have a coarse-silty particle size control section. Morris, Rexford, and Scriba soils have a coarse loamy particle-size control section. Norchip and Ontusia soils have frigid temperature regimes. Ravenna and Venango soils have an argillic horizon."

These soils formed in till of Wisconsin age derived from siltstone, sandstone, shale, and some limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 795 to 1725 mm (31 to 68 in), mean annual temperature ranges from 6.0 to 11.0 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F) and mean annual growing season ranges from 105 to 180 days.  Generally, these soils occur at elevations between 100 and 670 m (328 to 2198 ft), but have been mapped as high as 750 m (2,460 ft) in some areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Erie Series was previously classified as Aeric Fragiaqualfs, however, laboratory data indicates these soils do not have enough illuviated clay to have a qualifying argillic horizon. A new typifying pedon was previously selected that fit the classification as an Aeric Fragiaquepts. In 2017, another new typifying pedon was selected in the mesic temperature class because the previous Typical Pedon was located in the frigid temperature regime.\nThe series is correlated extensively in New York but may exist in border areas of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in) (Ap and E horizons).\n2. Fragipan - the zone from 46 to 94 cm (18 to 37 in) (Bx horizon)\n3. Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime, and matrix or ped faces with dominant 2 chroma or less with redoximorphic features, within 51 cm (20 in) of the soil surface (Bg) horizon).\n4. Aeric subgroup - a zone within 30 in of the soil surface that has chroma higher than 2 in 50 percent or more of the matrix (E horizon)."
