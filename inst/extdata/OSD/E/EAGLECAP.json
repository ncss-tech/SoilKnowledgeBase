  "OVERVIEW": "The Eaglecap series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains. They formed in colluvium derived dominantly from quartz diorite, with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Slopes are 30 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

Depth to the contrasting loamy-skeletal 2Bw horizon is 15 to 25 inches and sandy-skeletal 2C horizon is 25 to 40 inches. Gravel typically ranges from 2 to 5 mm in size.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry. The A2 horizon has moist value of  3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry.  The A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy loam or ashy silt loam and has 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 20 to 30 percent stones, with 35 to 60 percent total rock fragments. It is weakly or moderately smeary. It is estimated to have  phosphate retention of 50 to 85 percent, ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.5 to 3.0 percent, eight times silica plus two times iron of 5 to 12 percent, eight times silica minus two times iron of 4 to 8 percent, and volcanic glass content of 60 to 80 percent. Bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 g/cubic centimeter.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
