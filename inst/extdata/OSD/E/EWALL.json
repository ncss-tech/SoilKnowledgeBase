The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 90 to 105 days. The particle-size control section averages 0 to 5 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe A1 and A2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. The A2 horizon texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or gravelly loamy sand and has 0 to 20 percent gravel. Organic matter is less than 1 percent. The dark colors are inherited from dark colored minerals.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or coarse sand, and is gravelly in some pedons. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline. Organic matter is less than 1 percent. The dark colors are inherited from dark colored minerals. This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 1 to 4 dry or moist. Texture is loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand and is gravelly in some pedons. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have thin gravel lenses below 40 inches. The C horizon is effervescent below a depth of 25 inches in some pedons."

Elevation is 100 to 3,500 feet. The climate is a continental type having hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. The frost-free season is 110 to 180 days."
