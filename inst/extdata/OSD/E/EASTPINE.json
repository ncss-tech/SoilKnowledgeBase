  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Eastpine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridges, shoulders and backslopes of mountains. Eastpine soils are formed in colluvial and residual material derived from metasedimentary rocks with an influence of volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
