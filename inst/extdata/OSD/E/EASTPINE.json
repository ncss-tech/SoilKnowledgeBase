  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eastpine soils occur on ridges, shoulders and backslopes of mountains. Elevations are 3,600 to 6,200 feet. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The soil is formed in colluvial and residual material derived from metasedimentary rocks with an influence of volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 40 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 45 to 85 days."

Ironside soils lack andic properties. Kettlecreek soils lack andic properties and are deep. Sparabutte soils lack andic properties, have an argillic horizon, are not skeletal in the particle-size control section and are grater than 18 percent clay. Vogel soils are shallow and associated with convex mid to upper slopes with sparse vegetation. Weatherspoon soils have an agrillic horizon and are deep."
