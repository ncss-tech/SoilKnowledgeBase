  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification changed from Vertic Haplaquolls to Ustic Epiaquerts 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  The series geomorphic setting was revised as a result of the update of MLRA 150A and the initial soil survey of Kenedy and Kleberg counties, Texas.  Originally, the series was mapped as two phases, a depressional phase and a relict drainage phase.  The soils of the two geomorphic positions classify differently.  The revised concept is having the Edroy series in enclosed depressions, while the relict drainage areas will be identified as the Banquete series as originally mapped in the 1965 soil survey of Nueces County, TX.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 104 cm (0 to 41 in). (A, Bw, and Bss1)\nVertic features: pressure faces and slickensides 18 to 178 cm (7 to 70 in). (Bw, Bss1, Bss2, and Bkss horizons)\nAquic feature: ponding and reducing conditions in most years\nADDITIONAL DATA: none\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
