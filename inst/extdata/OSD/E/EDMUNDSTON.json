  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact with weathered granitic rock or granite-gneiss ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  The soil between the depths of 10 to 20 inches becomes moist in some or all parts sometime in November and remains moist until late May.   It is dry all the rest of the year.  Mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 59 degrees F.  These soils are neutral to medium acid throughout.  Base saturation is 75 to 95 percent throughout.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent at 20 inches and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent at 24 to 30 inches.  The particle size control section contains less than 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is gray, grayish brown or brown (10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/3).   It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or light loam.  Rock fragments, 2mm to 10 inches in diameter, range from 0 to 25 percent by volume.\nThe Bw horizon is gray, grayish brown, brown, dark brown or dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/3, 4/4).  It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, light loam, or gravelly light loam, and has less than 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments, 2mm to 10 inches in diameter, range from 5 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon is brown, dark brown, or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3).  It is gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, light loam or gravelly light loam.  Rock fragments, 2mm to 10 inches in diameter, range from 5 to 30 percent by volume."

Ritter soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 49 degrees F., a frost-free season of about 120 days and are neutral or mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Edmundston soils are on uplands with slope gradients of 30 to 75 percent.  They formed in material weathered from granitic rocks or granite-gneiss.  Elevations are 2,000 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal having warm dry summers and cool wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 21 inches, much in the form of snow.  Average January temperature is 34 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 75 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F.  Freeze-free season is 150 to 225 days."
