  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 26 to 50 inches or more.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments of angular quartz and weathered fragments of dark colored rock range from 0 to 35 percent throughout.  The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The Ap horizon includes 5YR hue.  The A and E horizon is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and their cobbly analogues.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles with hue of 5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 6 may be present.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon is generally mottled with hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 6 or 8.  The BC horizon is sandy loam through silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon is similar in color and texture to the BC horizon."

Albemarle and Clymer soils are dominated with sandstone coarse fragments. Allegheny soils contain water worn coarse fragments and are yellower than 7.5YR throughout the soil.  Allenwood and Chilmark soils have coarse fragments subrounded by glacial action. Arendtsville, Birdsboro, Chetwynd, and Shouns soils do not have coarse fragments of granodiorite.  Aura, Fairfax and Thurmont soils include 7.5YR and 10YR hue in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Bedington, Bucks, Butano, Frankstown, Gilpin, Leck Kill, Manassas, Nixon, Rayne, Shelocta, Ungers, and Whiteford soils are dominated with shale coarse fragments.  Chester soils have mica in the lower B horizon.   Collington and Freehold soils contain glauconite.  Edgemont, Elsinboro, Glenelg and Quakertown soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Meadowville soils are yellower than 7.5YR throughout the soil.  Murrill soils are dominated with limestone coarse fragments.  Tate soils are dominated with granite coarse fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eubanks soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands of the Northern Piedmont Plateau and/or Northern Blue Ridge. Gradients are mostly between 2 and 15 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in a weathered product from fine to medium grained granodiorites at elevations from about 600 to 800 feet.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 degrees F to 57 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."
