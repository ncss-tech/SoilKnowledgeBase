Andanada soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 54 degrees F. Daklos soils do not have visible secondary calcium carbonate. Hillburn soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Meriwhitica soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F. Nonipsoils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Redsun soils have hues of 7.5YR or 2.5YR. Reef soils have hues of 7.5YR or 5YR. Skos soils have hues of 5YR or 2.5YR and 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Sunup soils have hues of 7.5YR or 5YR and 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Teesto soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 56 degrees F. and averages 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Windcomb soils have hues of 5YR or 2.5YR. In addition, Hillburn, Nonip, Reef, Skos, and Windcomb soils do not have visible secondary calcium carbonates."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ednagrey soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slope ranges range from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone. Elevations are 6,900 to 8,200 feet. The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and occasional summer thundershowers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches; mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."
