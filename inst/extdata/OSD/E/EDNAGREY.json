  "OVERVIEW": "The Ednagrey series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone. Ednagrey soils are on backslopes mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Hillburn soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Meriwhitica soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F. Nonipsoils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Redsun soils have hues of 7.5YR or 2.5YR. Reef soils have hues of 7.5YR or 5YR. Skos soils have hues of 5YR or 2.5YR and 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
