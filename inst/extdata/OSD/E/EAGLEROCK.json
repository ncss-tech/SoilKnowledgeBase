  "OVERVIEW": "The Eaglerock series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Eaglerock soils are on concave mountain side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
