  "OVERVIEW": "The Eaglepass series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. The Eaglepass soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
