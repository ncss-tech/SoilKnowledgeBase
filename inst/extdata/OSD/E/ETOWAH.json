  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 60 inches thick. Depth to bedrock, commonly limestone, ranges from 6 to 15 feet or more. Coarse fragments are commonly less than 5 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent in each horizon, except the A horizon ranges to 20 percent. Some pedons contain some fine mica flakes.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid in recently limed areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The fine earth texture is dominantly silt loam, but the range includes loam  and silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  The lower part has few to common mottles in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  The texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has the same color as the Bt horizon.  The texture is silty clay or clay."

Addielou soils have A horizons more than 20 inches thick.  Allen, Avilla, Holston, and Leesburg soils have A horizons with value of 4 or more.  Bama soils have sandy A horizons.  Holston, Leesburg, and Norfork soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizon. Minvale, Nella, Octavia, and Pikeville soils have more than 15 percent fragments in the B horizon.  Orangeburg, Ruston, and Smithdale soils have a higher sand content throughout the solum."

These soils formed in alluvium or colluvium that is commonly underlain by limestone residuum below 40 inches.  Average annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. near the type location."
