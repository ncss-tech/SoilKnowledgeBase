  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually dry and are dry each year for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice between depths of 8 to 24 inches and are moist in some part within depths of 8 to 24 inches for a continuous period equal to more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature at depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 56 degrees F.  The solum is mildly to moderately alkaline throughout and calcareous in the lower portion.  Depth to lime is 10 to 24 inches.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It ranges from fine sandy loam to gravelly fine sandy loam in the C1 horizon and very gravelly fine sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam in the IIC2 and IIC3ca horizons.  Rock fragments in the C2 and C3 horizons range from 2 to 10 percent cobbles and 40 to 65 percent pebbles.\nThe duripan ranges from weakly to strongly cemented."

Mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F., mean winter temperature is 34 to 36 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 71 to 73 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 140 to 200 days."
