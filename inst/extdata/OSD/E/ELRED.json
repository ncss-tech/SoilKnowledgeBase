  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to 65 inches.  Combined thickness of the A and Bir horizons is 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline in the A\nand Bir horizons and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the\nBg horizon and neutral to moderately alkaline in the IIC horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue 10YR, value 3, chroma 1, value 4 or 5,\nchroma 1 or 2; or hue N, value 3.  Where the value of 3.5 or less, thickness is less than 10 inches.  Texture is coarse sand, sand,\nor fine sand.\nThe A2 horizon has hue 10YR, value 5 to 7, chroma 1 to 3 and value\n7, chroma 4.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe A3 horizon has hue 10YR, value 5 to 7, chroma 3 or 4.  Texture\nis coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe B21ir horizon has hue 10YR, value 5 or 6, chroma 4 to 8 or hue 7.5YR, value 5, chroma 6 or 8.  The B22ir horizon has hue 10YR,\nvalue 3 to 6, chroma 4, or hue 7.5YR, value 4 or 5, chroma 4.  Texture of the Bir horizons is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue 10YR, value 4 to 7, chroma 1 or 2; or hue\n5Y, value 4 or 5, chroma 1 or 2; or hue 2.5Y, value 4, chroma 2;\nor hue N, value of 4 or 5.  In some pedons the Btg horizon has hue 10YR, value 5, chroma 4 to 8 with many coarse mottles in shades of gray.  Texture of this horizon is sandy loam or sandy clay loam,\nand in many pedons contains pockets or lenses of sand or loamy\nsand as well as lumps of sandy clay.  The average clay content is\n13 to 20 percent, but the range is from about 12 to 35 percent.\nSome pedons have a B3g horizon with colors similar to the Btg horizon.  Texture is dominantly loamy fine sand.\nThe C horizon is a mixture of sand and shell fragments.  The\nmatrix has hues of 10YR through 5Y, value 4 through 7, chroma 2 or less.  In some areas shell fragments are not in this horizon."
