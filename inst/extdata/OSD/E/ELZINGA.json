  "OVERVIEW": "The Elzinga series consists of deep to very deep, well drained soils on very steep north or northeast facing mountain sides. They formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and limestone.  Slope ranges from 30 to 60 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm.",
