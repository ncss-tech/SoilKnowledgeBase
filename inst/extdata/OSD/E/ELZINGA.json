  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick.  The combined thickness of A1, A2, and B2t horizons is more than 60 inches.  Coarse fragments are mainly cobble and gravel size angular sandstone rock fragments, ranging from 30 to 50 percent in the A21 horizon and 35 to 60 percent in the A22 and B2t horizons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at 20 inches depth is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in some subhorizons for 30 to 40 days during the late summer months.  The 01 horizon is 1/2 to 2 inches thick.  The A1 horizon has value of 1 or 2 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and 1 or 1.5 moist.  It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular structure.  It is slightly acid to medium acid.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, cobbly silt loam or cobbly very fine sandy loam.  It has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure or is massive.  It is slightly acid to medium acid.  The A2 horizon tongues into the B2t horizon.  The B2t horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very cobbly clay loam to very cobbly loam, with 35 to 60 percent cobble and gravel.  It has moderate medium to fine subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid to medium acid."

Flygare soils have moist chroma of 2 or more in the mollic epipedon and an average summer temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  LaPlatta soils lack albic horizons and have horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Lucky Star and Scave soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick with moist chroma of 2 or more and an average summer temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  Maughan soils have cobbly clay argillic horizons containing less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Smarts soils have mollic epipedons with chroma of 2 or more, lack albic horizons, and have very cobbly heavy loam argillic horizons."

They formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and limestone.  The climate is moist subhumid, with an average annual precipitation of 20 to 26 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F.  The frost free season is 70 to 120 days."
