  "OVERVIEW": "The Emelle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from calcareous shale. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 6 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.",
