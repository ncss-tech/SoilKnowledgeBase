    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Beluga and Moose River series of the same family, and the Maybeso, Nikolai, and Sunnyhay series.  The Beluga soils are formed in strongly mottled stratified sandy, silty, and clayey materials on colluvial slopes.  The Moose River soils are formed in stratified sandy and silty alluvial materials.  The Maybeso soils have more than 16 inches of sapric peat over glacial till.  The Nikolai soils have more than 16 inches of sapric peat over a loamy substratum.  The Sunnyhay soils consist of shallow sapric peat over bedrock."

The topography is irregular and contains many rock outcrops.  The climate is cool maritime, with mean annual precipitation of more than 80 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 36 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 38 degrees F."

The Guguak and McGilvery soils consist of well-drained organic material over bedrock.  The Kupreanof soils are formed in glacial till and have spodic horizons.  The Tebenkof soils consist of well-drained forest litter over fragmental material.  The Tolstoi soils are formed in thin gravelly material over bedrock, and have spodic horizons."
