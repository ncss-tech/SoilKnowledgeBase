  "OVERVIEW": "The Essal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in unconsolidated lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks.  The Essal soils are on lakeplains and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
