  "OVERVIEW": "The Eightmile series consists of shallow, well drained, soils that formed in residuum derived from shale, sandstone, and quartzite.  Eightmile soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
