  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 19 inches thick.  The upper boundary of the B2t horizon ranges from 24 to 39 inches.  The combined thickness of the A1, A2, and B2t horizons ranges from 47 to 60 inches or more over bedrock.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 47  to 60 inches or more over bedrock.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 30 to 45 days during the late summer.  Rock fragments consist of rounded sandstone pebbles and cobbles, and range from 0 to 10 percent in the A1 horizon, 0 to 20 percent in the A2 horizon, and 0 to 25 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from slightly to medium acid, and is 12 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry and moist.  It ranges from sandy loam or loam to light clay loam.  This horizon ranges from slightly to medium acid.  It generally tongues into the B2t horizon and ranges from 6 to 20 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6 dry, 4 to 8 moist.  It ranges from clay loam to silty clay loam and has 30 to 35 percent clay.  Structure ranges from weak to strong, medium or coarse, subangular blocky or prismatic.  Clay films are common to many, thin to moderately thick.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from sandstone.  The climate is humid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 32 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 53 to 56 degree F.  The frost free season ranges from 30 to 80 days."
