  "OVERVIEW": "The Epitaph series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt.  Epitaph soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
