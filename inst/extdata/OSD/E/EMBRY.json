  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are typically noncalcareous throughout, however some pedons may effervesce below a depth of 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 5 percent and are mainly gravel size sandstone fragments.  The control section is typically sandy loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 50 to 83 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The moisture control section is dry for 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days between July 15 and October 25.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Embry soils are on alluvial fans, hills, dunes and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevation is 4200 to 6000 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from noncalcareous sandstone.  Annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches most of which falls as rain or snow in April, May, and June.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Julesburg soils have argillic horizons and mollic epipedons.  Orpha soils are in the sandy family. Taluce soils have a paralithic contact at 10 to 20 inches."
