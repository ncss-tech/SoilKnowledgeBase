The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperatures varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay with 15 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is stratified very to extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy fine sand with 5 to 10 percent clay. It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bosland, Carlotta, Coppercreek, Devilscreek, Hely, Hookton, Watches, and Wedderburn (T) soils.  Bosland soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Carlotta and Coppercreek soils have ochric epipedons.  In addition, Carlotta soils are moderately well drained.  Devilscreek and Hookton soils have redox concentrations with the solum.  Hely soils cannot be used to compete due to the age of Official Series Description.    Watches soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F. and have channer shaped rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ettersburg soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevations are 40 to 100 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 270 to 330 days.  Ettersburg soils occur on the Winkle geomorphic surface."

Bagness and Bayside soils have an occasional flooding hazard, and irregularly decreasing organic carbon content with depth.  In addition, Bayside soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Bigriver soils are coarse-loamy, have a frequent flooding hazard, and have irregularly decreasing organic carbon content with depth.  Pistolriver soils have contrasting textures at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are somewhat poorly drained.  All to these soils are on adjacent flood plains."
