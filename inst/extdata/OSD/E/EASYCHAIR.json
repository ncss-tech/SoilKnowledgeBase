  "OVERVIEW": "The Easychair series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Easychair soils are on lake plains, alluvial flats and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
