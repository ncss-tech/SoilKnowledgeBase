  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 54 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following summer solstice. Depth to secondary lime is 12 to 34 inches. Depth to a duripan is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness and includes the Bw horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4 dry and moist. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkqm horizon has colors and reaction like the Bk horizon and consists of layers of indurated lime-silica duripan separated by lenses of friable, calcareous silt loam. The duripan is underlain by basalt below 40 inches in some pedons.\nA thin 2Bkq horizon is present in some pedons. It is similar to the Bk horizon but has 20 to 50 percent rock fragments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in loess with a small amount of volcanic ash over a lime-silica cemented duripan. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. Average January temperature is about 29 degrees F, average July temperature is 71 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 180 days."

Benge and Walla Walla soils lack a duripan. In addition, Benge soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Benge soils are on terraces.  Walla Walla soils are on hills."
