  "OVERVIEW": "The Eastable series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium weathered from lacustrine tuff and extrusive igneous rock.  Eastable soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil temperature is about 41 degrees F from about March 15 to about December 1 and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to about November 15.  The soil between depths of 7 to 17 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 until November 10 and is not moist in some part for as long as 90 consecutive days.  Solum thickness ranges from 14 to 24 inches.  The organic matter content is 2 to 3 percent in the surface and decreases regularly with depth.  Pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 2/1.  Clay content is 18 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 5/2, 6/2 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loam or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and averages 1 to 3 percent (absolute) more clay content than the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/4 or 8/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4, or 6/2."
