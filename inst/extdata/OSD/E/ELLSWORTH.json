  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 71 to 117 cm (28 to 46 inches). The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay. Rock fragment lithology is predominantly shale and siltstone, with minor amounts of limestone and crystalline erratics.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. In uncultivated areas, the A horizon is 3 to  8 cm (1 to 3 inches) thick and has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon, 8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 inches) thick that has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Silty degradation surfaces are common in the BE and Bt horizons in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 10 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nA BC or BCt horizon, up to 30 cm (12 inches) thick is present in some pedons. It has a matrix and coating colors similar to that of the Bt horizon.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is clay loam or silty clay loam. Subhorizons of silty clay are in some pedons. Rock fragment content commonly ranges from 2 to 10 percent, though channery analogues may be present in bedrock substratum phases - see Remarks. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent. Shale and sandstone substratum phases are recognized. In shale and sandstone substratum phases, bedrock is at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches).  The C horizon is silty clay loam and silty clay with channery analogues in the shale substratum phase, and loam and sandy loam with channery analogues in the sandstone substratum phase. These phases are commonly noncalcareous to bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cardington, Geeburg, Glynwood, Mississinewa, Mortimer, Pert, Shinrock and Wyatt series. The Cardington soils have rock fragments of primarily sandstone and shale in the series control section.  The Glynwood and Mortimer soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of more than 15 percent in the lower part of the series control section. Geeburg soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Mississinewa and Pert soils have sola less than 71 cm (28 inches) thick. Shinrock and Wyatt soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ellsworth soils formed in low-lime till on plains of Wisconsinan age typically with a calcium carbonate equivalent of between 5 and 15 percent. The till is derived from shale and sandstone, with minor amounts of limestone and crystalline rocks.  Slope range is from 0 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 inches) and the mean annual temperature commonly is about 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Mahoning soils, the poorly drained Trumbull soils, and the very poorly drained Miner soils form a toposequence with the Ellsworth soils. These soils occupy lower or less sloping landscape positions."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is moderate to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the subsoil and moderately low or low in the underlying material.  A perched seasonal high water table is from 28 to 61 cm (11 to 24 inches) from November to May in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Areas with slopes less than 12 percent are mostly cleared and used as cropland. Corn, wheat, oats, soybeans, and mixed hay are the principal crops. Moderately steep areas with slope from 12 to 18 percent that are eroded because of past cultivation are reverting to pasture. Steeper areas are in woodland or permanent pasture. Original vegetation was deciduous forest. Many areas near cities are in nonagricultural uses."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches)  (Ap, BE)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 94 cm (11 to 37 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3)\n3. Aquic conditions - the upper limit of a seasonal high water table is at 28 cm (11 inches) (Bt horizon).\nThe typical pedon appears to have a densic contact described.  This feature will need to be properly evaluated during future MLRA projects.   These projects are identified in NASIS.\nThe sandstone and shale substratum bedrock phases will need to be evaluated during future MLRA project activities.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data are available for the following profiles in Ohio:  CY-S5; GA-S16; HU-5; HU-E5; LR-9; LR-10; LR-11; LR-12; LR-S5; MD-9; MD-3 ; MH-34; PG-S11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
