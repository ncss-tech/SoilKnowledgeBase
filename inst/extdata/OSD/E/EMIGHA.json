  "OVERVIEW": "The Emigha series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Emigha soils are on upland toeslopes and low terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
