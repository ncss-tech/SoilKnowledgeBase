The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and includes the upper part of the B horizon.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR in the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 dry and chroma of 2 to 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is loam with 20 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent soft rock fragments. Organic matter is 10 to 15 percent.\nThe BA horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or gravelly loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent soft rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 5 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent soft rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 50 to 200 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210 to 300 days.  Ekoms soils occur on the Senecal geomorphic surface."
