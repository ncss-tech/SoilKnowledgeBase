  "OVERVIEW": "The Emlin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from limestone, quartzite and sandstone. Emlin soils are on piedmont slopes, structural benches, mountains, plateaus, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
