(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 19 to 60 inches. (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)\nRemarks: This soil was proposed in Teton County, Montana. The type location was moved to Moffat County, Colorado, in 1985.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nThe classification was changed from Aridic Argiborolls to frigid Calcidic Argiustolls 12/98.\nTaxonomic Version: Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
