The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 254 to 457 millimeters (10 to 18 inches).  Mean January temperature is 8 degrees C (47 degrees F); mean July temperature is 24 degrees C (76 degrees F); mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 17 degrees C (59 to 62 degrees F).  The frost-free season ranges from 250 to 300 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Egbert soils as mapped in the 1977 Contra Costa Co. SSA are now excluded from this revised concept.  The pH values in typical pedon were described when the soil was moist.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were checked in 2016 - ET.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 79 centimeters (31 inches) (Ap, A)\nMineralogy is assumed to be mixed.\nCumulic subgroup - the mollic epipedon is greater than 60 centimeters (24 inches) thick and the organic carbon decreases irregularly with increasing depth.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil was laboratory sampled as 15N0731 (S2015CA067002).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
