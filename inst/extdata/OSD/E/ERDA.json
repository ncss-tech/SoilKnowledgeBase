  "OVERVIEW": "The Erda series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rock sources on lake terraces, alluvial flats and fan terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section is dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 67 to 72 degrees F.\nThe mollic epipedon is 7 to 23 inches thick. Some pedons have a cambic horizon with an increase in clay.  The depth to the calcic horizon is 7 to 23 inches.  The particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is strongly or violently effervescent.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.

(Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches.\nIn 1/95 the classification was changed from Aridic Calcixerolls to Typic Calcixerolls.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
