Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout. The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 15 percent by volume.\nThe Oi horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Content of pebbles, cobbles or stones range from 2 to 10 percent, by volume. Texture is mucky peat.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2. Content of pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume. Texture is silt loam or clay loam.\nThe Bwg horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, red and gray range from few to common throughout. Content of pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, red and gray range from few to common. Content of pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume. Texture is silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of slightly to highly weathered volcanic bedrock. It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R horizon is composed of consolidated volcanic bedrock."
