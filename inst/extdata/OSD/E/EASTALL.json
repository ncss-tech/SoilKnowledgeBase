During periods of below normal rainfall some areas are cropped to wheat, cotton, and grain sorghum.  Native vegetation is buffalograss, vine mesquite, white tridens, panicums, sedges, Pennsylvania smartweed, evening primrose, cocklebur, and wooly leaf bursage."

Cracks that are open 90 or more cumulative days in most years.  Gilgai microrelief is on most undisturbed areas.\nRedoximorphic feature: Redox concentration - zone of apparent accumulation of iron oxides.  Redox depletion - zone of low chroma, 2 or less where iron oxides have been removed.\nRange Site:  Lakebed - 078BY078TX; 078CY102TX.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data from Jackson County, OK (S98OK-065-003)\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
