  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkwalow series consists of deep, somewhat poorly or moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till derived from basalt.  Elkwalow soils are on mesa tops.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
