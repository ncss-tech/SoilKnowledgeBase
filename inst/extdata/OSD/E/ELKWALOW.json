  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkwalow series consists of deep, somewhat poorly or\nmoderately well drained soils formed in glacial till derived\nfrom basalt.  Elkwalow soils are on mesa tops.  Slopes range\nfrom 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35\ninches and mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
