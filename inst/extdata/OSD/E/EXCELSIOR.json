    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil moisture control section of 8 to 20 inches is dry in all parts from April 1 through December and is not continuously moist for 90 consecutive days. The organic matter is less than 1 percent at the surface and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 61 degrees to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2; 2.5Y 6/2 or 7/2. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2. Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 3 percent. It is noneffervescent to strongly effervescent with disseminated carbonates. Electrical conductivity is 0 to 8 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 0 to 13. Electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio are affected by agricultural practices. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Eroded phases are present in some areas.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3,; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 7/2 or 7/4. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2 or 5/4. Texture is stratified loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam and silt loam. Few fine distinct relict redoximorphic masses of iron accumulation occur in the lower C horizon in some pedons. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent. It is very slightly effervescent to violently effervescent and has disseminated and/or segregated carbonates. Electrical conductivity is 0 to 16 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 0 to 80. Electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio are affected by agricultural practices. Reaction is moderately alkaline or very strongly alkaline."

Anthony soils (MLRA 40, 41, 42), Gila soils (MLRA 40, 41, 42), Rucker soils (MLRA 41) and Tobler soils (MLRA 30, 42, 70) are all on alluvial fans and flood plains. They are all intermittently moist in some part of soil moisture control section as a result of precipitation in the late summer months. Rucker soils have mean annual precipitation of 10 to 12 inches. Tobler soils have color hues of 2.5YR and 5YR."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from igneous and calcareous sedimentary rocks. Elevation is 180 to 1,000 feet. The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches. Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 80 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F. Frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."
