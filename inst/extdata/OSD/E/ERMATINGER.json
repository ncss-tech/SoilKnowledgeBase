  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ermatinger series consists of deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy deposits on former glacial river flood plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Where present, the A horizon has the same colors as the Ap horizon.  The textures of the A horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or mucky analogues.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4.  Textures are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand.  Some pedons contain thin strata of very fine sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  Colors are commonly stratified within horizons.  Organic layers and buried logs are found in some C horizons."
