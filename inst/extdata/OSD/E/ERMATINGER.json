  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline in the solum and Cg1 and is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the Cg2 and Cg3.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where present, the A horizon has the same colors as the Ap horizon.  The textures of the A horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or mucky analogues.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4.  Textures are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand.  Some pedons contain thin strata of very fine sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  Colors are commonly stratified within horizons.  Organic layers and buried logs are found in some C horizons."
