  "OVERVIEW": "The Ekal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable saline soils formed in intermittent clayey lakebed deposits derived from limestone.  These nearly level depressional and playa soils occur on depressions on dissected plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm (18 in).",
