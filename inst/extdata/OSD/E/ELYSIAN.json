Texture is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.  The BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt part of the Bt/E horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with grayish, brownish, or reddish mottles.  Clay content of the Bt/E horizons ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  The E part of the Bt1/E horizon makes up about 15 to 30 percent by volume and occurs as tongues.  The E part of the Bt2/E horizon makes up about 5 to 15 percent by volume and occurs as interfingers.  The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E part is less clayey than the Bt part.  About 5 to 50 percent of the Bt/E horizons are brittle when moist or dry.  Brittle parts in the Bt part of the Bt/E horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 to 8. The Bt/E horizons range from medium acid to very strongly acid.  Some pedons have a few siliceous pebbles in the Bt1/E horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These are nearly level to gently sloping soils on terraces and occur as circular or oblong mounds, 2 to 5 feet high and 40 to 100 feet in diameter in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B).  The top of the mound is very gently sloping, and the side slope is very gently sloping or gently sloping.  The regolith is loamy sediments of Cretaceous age. The climate is humid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. Thornthwaite annual P-E Index ranges from 64 to 84."
