  "OVERVIEW": "The Elysian series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy material of Cretaceous age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on mounds of terraces in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B).  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 inches, and mean annual temperature is 61 degrees.",

Texture is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.  The BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt part of the Bt/E horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with grayish, brownish, or reddish mottles.  Clay content of the Bt/E horizons ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  The E part of the Bt1/E horizon makes up about 15 to 30 percent by volume and occurs as tongues.  The E part of the Bt2/E horizon makes up about 5 to 15 percent by volume and occurs as interfingers.  The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E part is less clayey than the Bt part.  About 5 to 50 percent of the Bt/E horizons are brittle when moist or dry.  Brittle parts in the Bt part of the Bt/E horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 to 8. The Bt/E horizons range from medium acid to very strongly acid.  Some pedons have a few siliceous pebbles in the Bt1/E horizon."
