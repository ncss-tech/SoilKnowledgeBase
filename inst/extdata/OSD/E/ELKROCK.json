  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkrock series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium with a high component of volcanic ash in the upper horizons.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
