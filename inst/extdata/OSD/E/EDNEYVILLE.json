  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Edneyville soils were previously classified and mapped in the Gray-Brown Podzolic great soil group. The 1/98 revision changes the family placement to coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Dystrochrepts per the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996). The particle-size control section of many pedons has a weighted average clay content marginal to fine-loamy. Similar soils in a fine-loamy family are associated on some landscapes. The CEC activity class placement is based on placement of similar soils such as Chestnut. Sample pedon S88-NC-121-007 classifies as superactive, but the active class is consistent with similar series. Horizon depths and runoff class were also revised at this time.  The 2/99 revision updates the classification to 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nMean Annual Air Temperature near Type Location:  13 degrees C. (56 degrees F)\nMean Annual Precipitation near Type Location:  1651 millimeters (65 inches)\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 23 cm, 0 to 9 inches (Oe, A and AB horizons)\nb. Cambic horizon--the zone from 23 to 81 cm, 9 to 32 inches (Bw horizons)\nc. Series control section--the zone from 25 to 102 cm, 10 to 40 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSoil Characterization Data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) website: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nSIR(s) (obsolete) : NC0023, NC0115 (Stony)\nRevised: 4/89-DLN; 1/98-DHK; 2/99, 6/00, 8/01, 3/03-MKC; 5/13-Semi tab format and minor changes to Range in Characteristics - MLRA 130B.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
