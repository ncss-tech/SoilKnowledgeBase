  "OVERVIEW": "Elmira series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on dunes of glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial terraces. They formed in thin layers of loess at surface over glaciolacustrine sediment, glaciofluvial outwash or shoreline deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7.2 degrees C.",
