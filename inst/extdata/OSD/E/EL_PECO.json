  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  El Peco soils have ochric epipedons and duripans.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 18 to 36 inches and is modally 24 inches.  Extremes range from 6 to 60 inches but this is usually because of cuts and fills made in land leveling.  The soils are usually dry between 10 and 40 inches; have mean soil temperatures greater than 59 degrees F., and have mixed mineralogy.\nThe A horizons range in color from very pale brown, pale brown, and light brownish gray in 2.5Y and 10YR hues; texture is fine sandy loam; reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline and slightly calcareous.\nThe upper C horizon ranges in color from very pale brown, pale brown, light gray and light brownish gray in 10YR and 2.5Y hues; in texture is fine sandy loam; in reaction from strongly to very strongly alkaline.  This horizon may have some compacted, weakly cemented areas that are discontinuous and 1 to 3 inches in size.\nThe Cm horizon is strongly cemented with lime and silica, but less than half the volume is destroyed by acid. The color is light brownish gray to light gray and there may be yellowish, brown or reddish mottles in places.  The duripan often consists of a series of layers 1 to 4 inches in thickness separated by uncemented material that is silty, loamy or sandy.  Degree of cementation is variable but usually decreases with depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  In the subgroup there are the Crebbin soils which have soil temperatures less than 59 degrees F. and the Stewart which is in a fine loamy family. Similar soils are the Fresno soils which have argillic horizons over the duripan and Pozo soils which have mollic epipedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The El Peco soils occur on nearly level to slightly depressed areas of old alluvial fans lying in the basin rim zone of large valley troughs.  The microrelief is irregular low hummocky.  The soils are developed in alluvium from granitic rock.  They occur at elevations of 100 to 300 feet in a subhumid, mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 8 to 9 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 82 degrees F."

Vegetation consists of annual grasses, forbs, salt and alkali-tolerant plants--salt grass, alkali sacaton, inkweed, alkali heath, coyote thistle, jackass clover."
