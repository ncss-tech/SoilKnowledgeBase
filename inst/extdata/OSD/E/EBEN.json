    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates ranges from 46 to 76 centimeters. Rock fragments are dominantly dolomite, dolomitic sandstone and limestone containing glauconite. Gravel content ranges from 10 to 30 percent in the A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons and from 40 to 65 percent in the 2BC and 2C horizons. Cobbles range from 10 to 20 percent, stones range from 5 to 20 percent and boulders range from 0 to 2 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is the cobbly or very cobbly analogues of fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 3. It has textures similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4. It is the cobbly or very cobbly analogues of sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 4. It is extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 4. It is extremely gravelly coarse sand."

The moderately well drained Nykanen, somewhat poorly drained Ensign, and the poorly drained Ruse soils are all shallow to bedrock. They are on adjacent bedrock terraces that were eroded by the glacial drainage channels. The moderately well drained Shoepac and well drained Trenary soils formed in loamy till. They are on summits and side slopes of adjacent ground moraines."
