  "OVERVIEW": "The Eben series consists of well drained soils that formed in very cobbly loamy deposits overlying extremely gravelly sandy glacial outburst flood deposits within glacial drainage channels. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy upper part and very high in the sandy lower part. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

It is the cobbly or very cobbly analogues of fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 3. It has textures similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4. It is the cobbly or very cobbly analogues of sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 4. It is extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 4. It is extremely gravelly coarse sand."

The moderately well drained Nykanen, somewhat poorly drained Ensign, and the poorly drained Ruse soils are all shallow to bedrock. They are on adjacent bedrock terraces that were eroded by the glacial drainage channels. The moderately well drained Shoepac and well drained Trenary soils formed in loamy till. They are on summits and side slopes of adjacent ground moraines."
