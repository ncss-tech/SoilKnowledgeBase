  "REVDATE": "09/2004",
  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Escatawba series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy over clayey colluvium derived from shale, sandstone, and limestone on colluvial fans and benches. Permeability of the soil is moderate in the upper part and moderately slow in the lower part. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Grimsley and Oriskany soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section, and are on backslope or footslope positions, or in associated drainageways. Grimsley soils also have bedrock within 40 to 60 inches. Jefferson and Shelocta soils are on backslope or footslope positions. Laidig soils found on similar positions have a fragipan. Tumbling soils have more clay and are on backslope or footslope positions. Weikert soils have bedrock at 10 to 20 inches and are on shoulder or backslope positions."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The Escatawba soils are used mostly for timber production or recreation. Some small areas are used for pasture or hay production. The native vegetation consists of an overstory of pitch pine, scarlet oak, white oak, white pine, red maple, chestnut oak, sugar maple, and black oak. The understory is mountain laurel, dogwood, rhododendron, blueberry, sourwood, sassafras, Virginia creeper, and greenbrier."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Formerly mapped as Laidig, Monongahela, Buchanan, Murrill, and Oriskany soils. The name Escatawba is from a creek near the type location.\nThe classification of this series was changed (2003 Rev.).from: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Typic Paleudults to: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Paleudults. The oxyaquic subgroup was not available when the series was established. Field evidence supports the oxyaquic classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 17 inches (A and BE horizons)\n2. Argillic horizon-the zone from 17 to 65 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons)\n3. A lithologic discontinuity at 30 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
