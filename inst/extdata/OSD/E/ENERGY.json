    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or\nclay loamy with thin strata of loamy sand.  Clay content of 10- to 40-inch control section is 18 to 30 percent, and sand coarser than very fine sand comprises more than 15 percent.  Degree\nstratification varies.\nThe A horizon is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), pale brown\n(10YR 6/3), light gray (10YR 7/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3), very pale brown (10YR 7/3), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  Where the A horizon has moist colors of 3.5 or less, it is less than 10 inches thick.\nIt is dominantly fine sandy loam, but ranges to sandy clay loam or loam.\nThe C horizons are brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2), pale\nbrown (10YR 6/3), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), very pale brown (10YR\n7/3, 7/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  Few thin strata of very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or dark brown also occur in the\nC horizon."

Bunyan soils are noncalcareous in\nthe upper part.  Clairemont and Weswood soils have fine-silty\ncontrol sections and in addition, Weswood soils have a cambic horizon.  Colorado soils have colors with hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Loire soils have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 72 degrees F.  Mangum soils are fine textured.  Varro soils have udic moisture regimes, and Yahola soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Energy soils are on nearly level flood plains\nof small streams.  Flooding occurs at intervals of once or twice a year to once each 5 to 20 years.  Slopes range from 0 to 2\npercent.  The soil formed in stratified calcareous alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 70 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation from 28 to 40 inches; and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices from 40 to 64.\nGeograhically Associated Soils:  These are the competing Bosque, Bunyan, and Weswood series, and the Deleon, Frio, and Lamkin\nseries.  Deleon and Frio soils have mollic epipedons and have more than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.\nLamkin soils have mollic epipedons and have fine-silty control sections."
