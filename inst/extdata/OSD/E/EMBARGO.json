  "REVDATE": "11/2007",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Embargo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately thin, noncalcareous, colluvium and residuum from basalt, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff. Embargo soils are on mountain slopes, plateaus, and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
