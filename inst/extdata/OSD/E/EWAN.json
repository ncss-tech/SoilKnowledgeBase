Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Ag and ACg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 0, 1, or 2.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent and include 0 to 15 percent subangular and rounded gravel; 0 to 10 percent subangular and rounded cobble.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, 5Y or 5GY; value moist of 2, 3 or 4; chroma moist of 0, 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay loam with strata of fine sand and sand common.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent and include 0 to 15 percent subangular and rounded gravel and 0 to 10 percent subangular and rounded cobble.  These horizons have a reduced matrix and/or common or many redox features; when present, redox concentrations have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist of 4 through 6; redox depletions have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5G, or 5GY; chroma moist of 0 through 2.\nThe C horizon (when present) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value moist of 3 through 5; chroma moist of 1 or 2.
