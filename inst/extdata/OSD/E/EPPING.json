  "OVERVIEW": "The Epping series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loamy residuum weathered from siltstone on uplands, escarpments and foot slopes.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Fragments of siltstone are on the surface and throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically silt loam and ranges to include silty clay loam, gravelly loam, loam and very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons lack AC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 8 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture and reaction are the same as the AC horizon.  The underlying siltstone is calcareous and weakly cemented."

Canyon and Tassel soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and in addition, Tassel soils have less than 12 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Dulce and Kinusta soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods during May and June.  Eslendo and Picante soils lack glass shards and have yellower hues.  Fairburn soils have more than 25 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Gerst soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the particle size control section.  Klondike, Redarrow and Spearfish soils have hue redder than 10YR.  Sandoval and Shingle soils contain more clay in the particle size control section.  Taluce soils have more sand in the particle size control section."
