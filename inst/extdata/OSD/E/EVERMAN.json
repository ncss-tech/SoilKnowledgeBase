Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or deeper. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 38 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 53 to 58 degrees F. The gravelly 2Bt horizon is not present in all pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam that is high in silt content or light silty clay loam and is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, loam high in silt or light silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is silty clay, heavy clay loam, heavy silty clay loam or gravelly heavy clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous and is strongly or moderately alkaline. Rock fragments in this horizon range from 35 to 60 percent and are mainly gravel."
