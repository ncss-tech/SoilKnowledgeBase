  "OVERVIEW": "The Eelriver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. Eelriver soils are on flood-plain steps in mountain river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
