  "OVERVIEW": "The Elbboc series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. Elbboc soils are on alluvial fans and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
