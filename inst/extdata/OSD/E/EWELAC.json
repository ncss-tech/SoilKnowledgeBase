  "OVERVIEW": "The Ewelac series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits. The Ewelac soils are on lake plains, basin floors, and alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
