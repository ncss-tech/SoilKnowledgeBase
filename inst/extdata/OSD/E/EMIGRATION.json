  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is less than 20 inches.  These soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the A and C horizons.  The soil matrix is slightly calcareous to noncalcareous.  The limestone fragments are strongly calcareous.  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry 6 or more years out of 10.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Value are not both 5 dry and 3 moist.  The C horizon is clay loam with 35 to 85 percent cobbles and gravel by volume.  The control section averages less than 35 percent clay."

Also, Anatone soils have cambic horizons and Montvale soils have argillic horizons and mean annual soil temperature more than 47 degrees F.  Mellinthin soils are calcareous throughout, have calcic horizons, and have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 47 degrees F.  Richmond soils have more than 40 percent lime in the control section and have mean annual soil temperatures more than 47 degrees F.  Wallsburg soils have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay."

The soils formed in shallow very cobbly or very gravelly residuum and colluvium from weathered limestone rocks.  the climate is moist subhumid, with an average annual precipitation of 15 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 44 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 120 days."
