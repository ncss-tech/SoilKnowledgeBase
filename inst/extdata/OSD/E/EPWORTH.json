  "OVERVIEW": "The Epworth series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in fine sands on lake plains, beach ridges, outwash plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
