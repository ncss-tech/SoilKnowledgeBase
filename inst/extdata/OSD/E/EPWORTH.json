The somewhat poorly drained Pipestone and Saugatuck soils, the moderately well drained Covert, and the very poorly drained Kingsville soils are on lower landscape positions. The excessively drained Grattan soils are medium sand. The excessively drained Nordhouse soils are on younger sand dunes immediately adjacent to the Great Lakes shorelines."
