    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 5 to 55 percent in the A horizon and from 20 to 60 percent in the B horizon and C horizon.  Volume of cobbles and stones ranges from 2 to 50 percent in the A horizon and from 15 to 50 percent in the B horizon and C horizon.  Stony phases are recognized in some places.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and is neutral or mildly alkaline in the substratum.  Depth to carbonates is greater than 60 inches, but many pedons contain  dolostone fragments that are partially weathered on the surface.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR,  value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Horizons with value moist of 3 have value dry of 6 or more. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 3.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or loamy coarse sand.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam, or gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; and value and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loamy coarse sandy, loamy sand, coarse sand, sand, or gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.

These soils formed in less than 2 feet of loamy deposits over gravelly or cobbly coarse sand glacial drift.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 37 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F."

Chetek and Rosholt soils are in a similar landscape and next to the Elderon soils, but contain less cobbles and stones.  Kennan soils are nearby in the landscape and have less cobbles, stones, and pebbles and more silt throughout the profile."
