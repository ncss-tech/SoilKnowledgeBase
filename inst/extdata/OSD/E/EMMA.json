  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness commonly is about 4 1/2 to 5 feet but ranges from about 4 to about 5 1/2 feet.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges between 54 and 59 degrees F.  Reaction throughout the solum (except A1 or Ap) ranges from strongly to extremely acid. Base saturation is less than 60 percent by ammonium acetate.\nThe A horizon typically is medium silty clay loam but ranges up to 40 percent clay.  The A1 or Ap horizon is 10YR 3/2 or 4/2.  In wooded areas the A1 commonly is 3 to 4 inches thick; in cultivated areas the Ap commonly is 6 to 9 inches thick with the A2 incorporated.\nThe B horizon commonly is yellowish brown but ranges to brown and dark yellowish brown.  Brown to dark brown mottles commonly occur in the B22 horizon and with increasing depth they become more numerous and grayer in color.  The B horizon has texture of medium silty clay loam.  Some subhorizons commonly are heavy silty clay loam.  Average clay content of the B horizon is less than 35 percent.  A few clay films are present in some pedons but the B/A clay ratio is less than 1.2.  Structure in the B horizon has grade of weak or moderate.  Thickness of the B horizon commonly ranges from 45 to 55 inches but in some pedons ranges to as thin as 36 inches.\nThe C horizon is heavy silt loam or light silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Emma soils typically are nearly level or gently sloping.  They are on terrace or second bottom positions along the Ohio River flood plains.  Slopes commonly are less than 2 percent but range to 12 percent.  The soils formed in acid water-laid sediments of mixed mineralogical composition.  Climate consists of hot summers and cold winters with mean annual temperatures between 45 and 57 degrees F and precipitation between 35 and 45 inches per year."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Emma soils are on similar landscape as the associated Sciotoville, Armiesburg, and Hurst soils and are on slightly higher positions than the associated Petrolia and Cape soils.  Sciotoville soils have a fragipan horizon.  Armiesburg soils have a mollic epipedon and higher reaction in the sola.  Hurst soils have an argillic horizon.  Petrolia and Cape soils are alluvial soils that formed in slack water sediments.  In addition Cape soils contain more clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Naturally moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is slow to medium.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Emma soils flood rarely for brief duration from March through June.  The water table is within 2.5 to 4 feet of the surface from February through April. USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cultivated crops such as corn, soybeans, and meadow, and for hardwood forrest such as oak and ash."
