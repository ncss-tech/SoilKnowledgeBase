  "OVERVIEW": "The Echard series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans and benches.  They formed in soft rhyolitic tuff or strongly cemented ash.  Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

These soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 38 to 41 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 52 to 57 degrees F.  The solum is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has valve of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 and 2 dry and 2 moist.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  The lower part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bt (argillic) horizon is clay loam, gravelly and cobbly clay loam to clay and gravelly and cobbly clay with about 35 to 42 percent clay.  Rock fragments in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon average less than 20 percent.  The BC horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from gravelly and cobbly loam to gravelly and cobbly clay loam."
