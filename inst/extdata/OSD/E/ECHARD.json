    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to soft rhyolitic tuff or strongly cemented ash is 5 to 10 feet (estimated).  These soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 38 to 41 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 52 to 57 degrees F.  The solum is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has valve of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 and 2 dry and 2 moist.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  The lower part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bt (argillic) horizon is clay loam, gravelly and cobbly clay loam to clay and gravelly and cobbly clay with about 35 to 42 percent clay.  Rock fragments in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon average less than 20 percent.  The BC horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from gravelly and cobbly loam to gravelly and cobbly clay loam."

The average annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 60 to 65 days.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F."
