  "OVERVIEW": "The Echard series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans and benches.  They formed in soft rhyolitic tuff or strongly cemented ash.  Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 530 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
