Briggsville, Eldean, Lamoille, Newnata, Paintcreek, Upshur, and Woodsfield soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Chrome and Redbrush (T) soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Wynn soils have a loess mantle of more than 25 cm (10 inches) in thickness."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edenton soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. The soils formed in highly weathered Illinoian till and in the underlying olive-colored residuum from calcareous interbedded shale and limestone with a mantle of loess up to 25 cm (10 inches) thick in places. Some pedons are underlain by bedrock that is more than half limestone, and in these the contact approaches lithic. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1067 mm (37 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F)."

Cincinnati and Rossmoyne soils have fragipan horizons and commonly are on lesser slopes above Edenton soils. Eden soils lack glacial erratics and are on steeper slopes below Edenton soils. Fairmount and Opequon soils are shallow to bedrock dominated by limestone and are on steeper areas below Edenton soils. Grayford, Jessup, and Loudon soils have a thicker silty mantle and have bedrock at a depth of more than 102 cm (40 inches). Lawshe soils have a mollic epipedon and do not have glacial erratics in the solum. They are on colluvial foot slopes."
