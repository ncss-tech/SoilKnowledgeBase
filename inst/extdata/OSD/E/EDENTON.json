  "OVERVIEW": "The Edenton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in till and the underlying residuum from clayey shale with thin strata of limestone, and in places a mantle of loess as much as 25 cm (10 inches) thick. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees) F.",

Some pedons are underlain by bedrock that is more than half limestone, and in these the contact approaches lithic. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1067 mm (37 to 42 inches).

Fairmount and Opequon soils are shallow to bedrock dominated by limestone and are on steeper areas below Edenton soils. Grayford, Jessup, and Loudon soils have a thicker silty mantle and have bedrock at a depth of more than 102 cm (40 inches). Lawshe soils have a mollic epipedon and do not have glacial erratics in the solum. They are on colluvial foot slopes."
