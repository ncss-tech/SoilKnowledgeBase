  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 11 to 21 inches.  These soils are typically noncalcareous through the argillic horizon but are always noncalcareous above a depth of 10 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent of which about half break down upon pretreatment.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam or loam with 8 to 18 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent sand of which more than 35 percent is fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is typically neutral or mildly alkaline but may be moderately alkaline when carbonates are present in the lower part.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam or loam with 5 to 12 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent sand.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam with 2 to 10 percent noncarbonate clay.  Carbonates are about evenly split between pedogenetic and autogenetic carbonates and range from 1 to 8 percent total.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr consists of soft, calcareous sandstone interbedded in some areas with very thin lenses of shale or siltstone.  Typically, carbonates occur in the matrix and in irregular seams though some parts of the sandstone are noncalcareous.  These beds have been observed to extend from 10 feet to over 30 feet in thickness."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Enos soils are on low rolling hills and rock controlled upper fan aprons.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from calcareous sandstone.  Slopes are typically simple but may be complex in some areas.  They are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation is 4,000 to 5,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and ranges from 5 to 9 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in late March, April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The estimated frost-free season is 105 to 140 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
