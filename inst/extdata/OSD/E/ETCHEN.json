  "OVERVIEW": "The Etchen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and conglomerate of quartzite and sandstone.  These soils are on mountain slopes and foot slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A1 horizon has moist value of 3 to depth of 4 to 8 inches and moist chroma of 4 or more below depth of2 to 8 inches.  The combined thickness of the A11, A12 and B2t horizons is 20 to 40 inches and the depth of bedrock is 21 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 50 to 85 consecutive days during the later part of the summer.  Rock fragments consist dominantly of angular sandstone and quartzite pebbles, cobbles, and stones, and range from 20 to 60 percent in the A1 horizon, 45 to 70 percent in the B2t horizon, and 60 to 80 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist in the upper 4 to 6 inches and 3 or 4 below, and 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist, 3 through 8 dry.  It ranges from very cobbly loam to gravelly loam.  The A11 horizon is dominantly slightly to moderately calcareous but is noncalcareous in some pedons.  It is dominantly mildly to moderately alkaline but may be slightly acid or neutral in some pedons.  The A1 horizon ranges from 4 to  12 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry.  It ranges from cobbly or very cobbly sandy clay loam to very gravelly or very cobbly loam, or to gravelly or very cobbly clay loam.  Structure ranges from weak through strong, fine through coarse subangular blocky.  Clay films are few to many, thin or moderately thick.  This horizon is dominantly slightly through strongly calcareous, but is noncalcareous in some pedons.  It is dominantly mildly alkaline through moderately alkaline but is slightly acid or neutral in some pedons.  The B2t horizon ranges from 9 to 25 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry.  It is moderately calcareous through very strongly calcareous, and ranges from 0 to 15 inches thick."
