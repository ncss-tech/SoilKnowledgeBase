  "OVERVIEW": "The Emmet series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils formed in sandy loam till on end moraines, drumlins, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
