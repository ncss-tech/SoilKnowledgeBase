    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid in the upper horizons and strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower horizons. Black manganese concretions range from few to common in some horizons of most pedons. COLE ranges from .04 to .09. Some Bt subhorizons may have slickensides.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 60 percent by volume in the A, Ap, and E horizons, and from 0 to 15 percent by volume, in the lower horizons. Fragments range from gravel to stones.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. In eroded phases the Ap horizon is clay loam silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles of high and/or low chroma are in lower Bt horizons of some pedons. Slickensides may be present in some subhorizons.  It is clay or clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, and typically has few to many mottles in shades of brown or yellow. In some pedons, this horizon lacks a dominant color and is mottled in shades of brown or yellow. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon has the same colors and the BC and CB horizons or is mottled or multicolored loamy saprolite weathered from mafic or intermediate, igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks."

Brantley, Meth and Zuber soils, on Coastal Plain uplands, have thicker sola. In addition Brantley and Meth soils have hue that ranges to 2.5YR, and Zuber soils have sandy A and AB horizons. Canton Bend, Cowton, Gundy, Magnet, and Mecklenburg soils have hues redder than 7.5YR. In addition, Canton Bend, on stream terraces, have mica in the upper sola and more than 30 percent silt in the control section. Cowton soils have Cr horizons at 20 to 40 inches. Gundy soils are underlain by Carolina slates and fine grained schist rock at 40\nto 72 inches. Capshaw and Hampshire soils are underlain by hard limestone at depths less than 60 inches. Maben soils have micaceous sands and shale at depths less than 60 inches. Skyuka soils have C horizons of alluvium, moderate shrink-swell potential in the Bt horizon, and range to 5YR hue in the Bt horizon. Spray soils have sola less than 20 inches thick. Sugartown soils have sola more than 60 inches thick. Wynott soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches."

Slopes are generally between 4 and 10 percent but range from 2 to 45 percent. The soil formed in clayey residuum weathered from mafic or intermediate, igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks such as diorite, diabase, gabbro, or hornblende gneiss or schist. Mean annual precipitation is 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., near the type location."

Armenia, Brewback, Frogsboro, Iredell, and Virgilina soils are not well drained and Armenia, Frogsboro, and Virgilina soils have smectitic mineralogy. Coronaca, Davidson, Gaston and Lloyd soils have Bt horizons with rhodic colors at least in the upper part. Also, Cullen, Davidson, Gaston and Lloyd soils are Ultisols. Cullen soils have red Bt horizons. Poindexter soils have weathered bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are fine-loamy. Sedgefield soils are moderately well drained. Wilkes soils have weathered bedrock within 20 inches of the surface. Winnsboro soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. All these soils except for Armenia, Iredell and Sedgefield are well drained and are on similar landscape positions as Enon soils. Armenia soils are in heads of drains, drainageways, and depressions. Brewback (T), Iredell, Sedgefield, and\nVirgilina soils are in upland flats, depressions, heads of drains, and\ntoeslopes."
