  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to soft shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is loam and some is clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and typically averages between 20 and 30 percent clay but ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay. It has up to 35 percent shale channers.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bw or Bk horizon.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is weathered shale bedrock.  Some pedons have a C horizon above the 2Cr horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Edgeley soils are on level to very steep till plains, glaciofluvial plains, or in stream valleys.  Slope gradients mainly are 1 to 6 percent and range from 0 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in a thin layer of till, glaciofluvial deposits, or colluvium overlying shale bedrock or material weathered from shale bedrock.  The climate is cool subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 20 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Barnes soils and the Brantford, Buse, Cavour, Cresbard, Forman, Hamerly, Kloten, Miranda, Parnell, Svea, Tonka, Vallers and Walsh soils.  None of the these soils, except the Kloten soils, have shale bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Barnes, Buse, Cavour, Cresbard, Forman, Miranda and Svea soils are on nearby till plains.  Buse soils do not have cambic horizons.  Cavour, Cresbard and Miranda soils have natric horizons. Forman soils have an argillic horizon.  Svea soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Brantford and Vang soils are on nearby outwash areas.  They are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Walsh soils are on nearby terraces, fans and foot slopes.  Vang and Walsh soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Hamerly and Vallers soils are on nearby swales and lower areas on till plains.  They have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  Kloten soils are on steep hills and edges of valleys.  They have shale bedrock at a depth of 9 to 20 inches and do not have a cambic horizon.  Parnell and Tonka soils are in kettles and basins.  Parnell soils are very poorly drained and Tonka soils are poorly drained."
