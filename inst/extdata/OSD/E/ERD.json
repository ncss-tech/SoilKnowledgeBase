  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is 20 to 34 inches, but ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Most pedons are leached of carbonates to depths of about 3 inches, but some contain free carbonates at the surface.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 26 inches and commonly extends into or through the Bg horizon.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Exchangeable sodium in the Bzg and Cg horizons ranges from 8 to 20 percent.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos per centimeter in the Bzg and Cg horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is clay, but is silty clay in some pedons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay averaging between 45 and 60 percent clay.\nThe Bzg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  If value is 5 and chroma is 2, there are mottles with high chroma present.  Accumulations of salts range from few to many.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Accumulations of salts range from few to many."
