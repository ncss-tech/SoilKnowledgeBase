  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 12 inches thick.  Free carbonates are found in all parts.  The particle-size control section averages between 60 and 85 percent clay.  These soils do not have rock fragments and contain less than 8 percent sand. The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 7 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral; value of 1 to 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry; chroma of 0 to 2, moist or dry.  Most pedons contain evidence of cracks filled with A material extend into the Bkss horizon.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Redoximorphic features are few or common and distinct or prominent.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent in the upper part and 10 to 30 percent in the lower part.\nThe Bk and BC horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Redoximorphic features are common or many and distinct or prominent.  Some pedons do not have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Redoximorphic features are common or many and distinct or prominent."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 650 millimeters.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer. Frost-free days range from 110 to 160.  Elevation ranges from 230 to 540 meters above sea level."

Eaglepoint soils occupy slightly higher positions than Northcote and contain a calcic horizon.  Minor associated soils are Bearden, Colvin, Fargo, Gunclub, Hegne, and Nielsville which contain less clay."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series replaces the Hegne series when mapped in a complex with Northcote clay.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches (Ap horizon); calcic horizon - the zone from 10 inches to 29 inches (Bkss1 and Bkss2 horizons); aquic suborder based on low chroma in the lower part of the mollic epipedon; very fine family - more than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section; Vertisol criteria - cracks and slickensides extend through the Bkss horizon.\nThe MLRA 56 steering committee has recommended classification be revised to the Typic subgroup.  The typical site appears to classify as Typic.  In addition, the landscape position of Eaglepoint does not warrant a label of somewhat poorly drained.  This revision will make the Eaglepoint-Northcote catena analogous to that of Hegne-Fargo.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record is MN0746.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
