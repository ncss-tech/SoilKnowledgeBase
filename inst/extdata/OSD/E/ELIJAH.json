  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elijah soils are on treads of stream terraces and dissected relict lakebeds in valleys, on fan piedmonts, and on lava plains at elevations of 2,300 to 5,200 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and volcanic ash over medium to coarse textured alluvium or lacustrine sediments.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 160 days."

Chilcott and Pigtail soils average more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Power soils do not have a duripan.  Purdam soils have a weakly to strongly cemented duripan.  Vickery soils do not have an argillic horizon.  These soils are on similar geomorphic positions."

The dominant natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Thurber needlegrass. Some areas have been urbanized."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - zone from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - zone from 7 to 21 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nIndurated duripan - zone from 30 to 41 inches (2Bkqm horizon)\nParticle-size control section - zone from 7 to 21 inches\nSoil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric\nThis revision replaces the typical pedon with one that is described to 60 inches.  The original pedon was not described below 40 inches and is suspected of having bedrock above 60 inches.  Bedrock substratum phases (basalt at 40 to 60 inches) in Ada County Area, Canyon County Area, and Wood River Area soil surveys will be correlated to a new series during MLRA updates.\nVirtue and Elijah soils appear to be very similar and could be correlated unless further investigations prove otherwise.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
