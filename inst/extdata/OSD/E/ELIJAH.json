  "OVERVIEW": "The Elijah series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium from loess and volcanic ash over medium to coarse textured alluvium or lacustrine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent on lava plains, fan piedmonts and valleys.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - zone from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - zone from 7 to 21 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nIndurated duripan - zone from 30 to 41 inches (2Bkqm horizon)\nParticle-size control section - zone from 7 to 21 inches\nSoil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric\nThis revision replaces the typical pedon with one that is described to 60 inches.  The original pedon was not described below 40 inches and is suspected of having bedrock above 60 inches.  Bedrock substratum phases (basalt at 40 to 60 inches) in Ada County Area, Canyon County Area, and Wood River Area soil surveys will be correlated to a new series during MLRA updates.\nVirtue and Elijah soils appear to be very similar and could be correlated unless further investigations prove otherwise."
