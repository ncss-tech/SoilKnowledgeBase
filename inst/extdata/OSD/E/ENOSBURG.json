  "OVERVIEW": "The Enosburg series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in sandy glaciofluvial or aeolian deposits underlain by loamy estaurine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  They are on glacial lake plains and glacial outwash areas.  Permeability is rapid in the surface layer and upper part of the substratum and moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the loamy layers ranges from 16 to 34 inches.  Depth to bedrock, skeletal, or coarse textured layers is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.  Some subhorizons have up to 20 percent rock fragments.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface layer and upper part of the substratum and from moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.  Some pedons have an A horizon.  Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine earth.  In some pedons subhorizons of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam, less than 5 inches thick, are present immediately above the finer textured 2C horizon.   Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe 2Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, silt, or silt loam.  Stratification is common.  Lenses of fine sandy loam and silty clay loam are common.  The weighted average of the clay content is less than 18 percent.  Consistence is friable or firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in the same family.  The Cook, Coveytown, Scarboro, Swanton, Wareham, and Whately series are in related families.  Cook soils have endosaturation and have more than 5 percent coarse fragments throughout.  Coveytown soils have endosaturation and have a subhorizon between the A horizon and a depth of 30 inches with dominant chromas of 3 or more.  Scarboro and Wareham soils have textures of loamy fine sand or coarser throughout the textural control section.  Swanton and Whately soils have clayey textures within the depths of 40 inches and Whately soils have a frigid temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Enosburg soils are nearly level and gently sloping soils on glacial lake plains or glacial outwash areas.  They are in depressions and drainage ways and on toeslopes of swells and knolls.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent, but is typically less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in thin sandy glaciofluvial or aeolian deposits underlain by loamy estaurine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 55 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees Fahrenheit.  The frost free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

The moderately well drained Eldridge and well drained Hinesburg soils are in a drainage sequence with Enosburg soils.  Canandaigua, Raynham, Scantic, Walpole, and Whately soils are on similar landforms.  These soils have finer textures in the upper part of the particle size control section.  Agawam, Belgrade, Deerfield, Hartland, Munson, Ninigret, and Suffield soils are in higher positions on the landscape.  Agawam, Belgrade, Hartland, Munson, Ninigret, and Suffield soils have finer textures in the upper part of the particle size control section.  Deerfield soils are sandy throughout.  Biddeford, Birdsall and Scarboro soils are in lower position on the landscape.  Birdsall and Biddeford soils have finer textures in the upper part of the particle size control section.  Scarboro soils are sandy in the lower part of the particle size control section."

Ochric epipedon -  the zone from 0 to 8 inches.\nb.  Particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches is sandy over loamy.\nc.  Aquic conditions as evidenced by a matrix of chroma 2 or less and redox concentrations throughout.\nd.  Mesic temperature regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record Numbers for Enosburg is VT 0007.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
