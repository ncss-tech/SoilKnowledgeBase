In addition, Roloc soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Koontz soils have argillic horizons with loam or clay loam texture, do not have significant amounts of medium or coarser sands, have rock fragments which are mainly gravel, and have paralithic materials of metamorphic (metavolcanic) rocks in the series control section.  Ubehebe soils have paralithic materials of siltstone in the series control section, are moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October, and have rock fragments which are mainly coarse gravel."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 75 to 100 days."
