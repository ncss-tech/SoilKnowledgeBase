  "OVERVIEW": "The Erastra series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granodiorite.  Erastra soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Koontz soils have argillic horizons with loam or clay loam texture, do not have significant amounts of medium or coarser sands, have rock fragments which are mainly gravel, and have paralithic materials of metamorphic (metavolcanic) rocks in the series control section.  Ubehebe soils have paralithic materials of siltstone in the series control section, are moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October, and have rock fragments which are mainly coarse gravel."
