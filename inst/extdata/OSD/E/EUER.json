    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 24 to 36 inches thick.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick and in some pedons includes the upper part of the B horizon.  The base saturation is 35 to 50 percent in the upper horizons.  Mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.   The mean summer soil temperature for pedons with 0 horizons (1 to 3 inches thick) is 49 to 53 degrees F., and 59 to 62 degrees F. for pedons without 0 horizons.  The soil is dry between depths of 8 and 30 inches from mid July through mid October and moist in some or all parts the rest of the time in most years.\nThe A horizon has colors of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 dry, and 10YR 3/2, 3/3, and 7.5YR 3/2 moist.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam with 10 to 20 percent pebbles.  This horizon has granular or weak subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly or moderately acid.\nThe B2t horizon has colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/6 dry and 10YR 3/3, 5/6, 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4 moist.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam or heavy sandy loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent by volume rock fragments (including pebbles through stones).  This horizon has subangular blocky structure or is massive.  It is slightly or medium acid."
