  "OVERVIEW": "The Equipaje series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. They formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. These soils occur on piedmont slopes, alluvial fans, and stream terraces. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 5 percent, dominantly 1 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F.",
