These soils formed from Holocene-age moderately coarse textured alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon convective thunderstorms from June to September. Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F. Frost-free period is 240 to 280 days. The elevation is 2,500 to 3,500 feet."
