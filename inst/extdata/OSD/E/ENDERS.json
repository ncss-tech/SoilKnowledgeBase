Mottles are in shades of brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their gravelly or channery analogs.  The average clay content in the upper 20 inches is 35 to 60 percent.  The lower Bt horizons have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4, or with value of 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, with mottles in shades of red, brown or gray, or it is a mottled horizon in these colors. Texture is silty clay, clay or their gravelly or channery analogs.\nThe BC horizon is mottled in hues of red, brown, yellow or gray.  Texture is silty clay, clay or their channery or very channery analogs.\nThe C horizon, where present, is mottled in hues of red, brown, yellow or gray.  Texture is silty clay, clay or their channery aor very channery analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is level bedded, extremely acid, soft, platy, shale bedrock.  Color varies depending on stage of weathering, but is generally black, brown, yellow, red, gray or a combination of these colors.   Hardness usually increases with depth, but the shale can be ripped with heavy earth moving equipment."

Albertville soils have argillic horizons with hues of 7.5YR or yellower.  Badin soils have 20 to 40 inch sola and a lithic contact with hard, slate bedrock.  Bengal soils have 20 to 40 inch sola and a paralithic contact with soft, shale bedrock with a dip of 20 degrees or more.  Bonwier soils have 20 to 40 inch sola and contain ironstone fragments in the argillic horizon.  Brockroad soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the upper part of the profile and contain common to many mica flakes in the lower part of the sola.  Carnasaw soils have a paralithic contact with the underlying shale bedrock that has a dip of more than 20 degrees.  Catharpin soils have 45 to 90 inch sola; have a lithologic discontinuity and contain few to many mica flakes in the lower part of the sola.\nCullen soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches, contain crystalline rock fragments and mica flakes.  Cunningham soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent in the upper part of the argillic horizon, other differentia is unclear.  Cuthbert soils have 20 to 40 inch sola and do not have a paralithic contact.  Endsaw soils have a paralithic contact with soft, shale bedrock that has a dip of 0 to 20 degrees.  Fluvanna soils formed in residuum from crystalline rocks; contain angular quartz fragments and have a paralithic contact with saprolite from crystalline rocks.  Galilee soils have 20 to 40 inch sola and a paralithic contact with sandstone, clay shale or siltstone.  Kirvin soils contain mica flakes in the C horizon and do not have a paralithic contact.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Enders soils are on nearly level to moderately steep upland mountaintop and ridges and gently sloping to very steep mountain sideslopes and footslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in loamy and clayey residuum weathered from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone of late Mississsippian or Pennsylvanian age.  Enders soils on moderately steep to very steep sideslopes and footslopes may have a thin layer of loamy colluvium over the clayey residuum.  Average annual air temperature at the type location is about 60 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is about 49 inches."
