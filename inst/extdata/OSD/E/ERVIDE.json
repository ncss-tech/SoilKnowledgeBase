  "OVERVIEW": "The Ervide series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial or eolian material deposited over lake sediments, underlain by sandstone.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
