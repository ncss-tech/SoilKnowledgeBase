  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the surface layers ranges from 7 to 20 inches and is the same as the depth to the Btn horizon. The mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from 7 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has platy structure.  It is strongly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some tilled pedons do not have an E horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.   It has strong grades of columnar or prismatic structure, which typically part to angular or subangular blocky.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have Btk or Btz horizons.  In these horizons carbonates or salts are in few or common, fine or medium accumulations in the interior of the prisms or columns.  Some pedons have Bky or Bkyz horizons.\nThe Bz horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Some pedons do not have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Typically the soil does not have fine grained soft sandstone within a depth of 60 inches, but it is at depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Desart, Evridge and Portal series in the same family.  Desart soils have combined A and E horizons ranging from 20 to 30 inches in thickness over the Btn horizon.  Evridge soils are moderately deep to soft sandstone.  Portal soils do not have stratified fine sand to fine sandy loam in the substratum and formed in glaciofluvial sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ekalaka soils are on level to strongly sloping terraces, fans and uplands.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.   The soils formed in stratified alkaline alluvium or residuum from soft sandstone.  The climate is cool, semi-arid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Desart and Ladner soils are in a complex with Ekalaka soils in some areas.  Ladner soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Daglum, Rhoades and Sorum soils are on nearby terraces or uplands.  Daglum and Rhoades soils are fine and Sorum soils are fine-loamy.  In addition Rhoades soils have visible salts or gypsum within a depth of 16 inches.  Parshall and Tally soils are on nearby upland terraces and fans and do not have natric horizons.  Vebar soils are on uplands and do not have natric horizons and, in addition, have soft sandstone within depths of 40 inches."
