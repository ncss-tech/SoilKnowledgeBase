  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated with stagnant water for at least a few days.  The depth to the upper boundary of the calcic horizon (Ck1) ranges from 25 to 39 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages from 28 to 33 percent clay can range from 20 to 35 percent clay.  Organic matter ranges between 1 and 3 percent in the upper 10 to 20 inches and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent below 20 inches.  Exchangeable sodium increases with depth.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 5/2; N 3/0 or N 4/0 and may be mottled.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2; 5Y 2/2, 3/1, 4/2; or 2.5Y 3/2 and N 3/0.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and may be calcareous.  Some pedons do not have A horizons.\nThe Bt1 horizon is 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 5/2 or 6/3 and may not be mottled. Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2; 5Y 4/1, 4/2 or 4/3.  There is distinct or prominent mottling.  It is clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  Typically, the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 1.2 mmhos/cm and the exchangeable sodium percentage is less than 5.\nThe Ck1 horizon is 10YR 8/1; 5Y 6/2, 6/3 or 7/1.  Moist colors are 5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 7/2 or 8/2.  Some pedons have mottling.  The value of the color depends on the percentage lime content which typically is from 30 to 50 percent but ranges as low as 15 percent.\nThe Ck2 horizon is stratified loam and clay loam layers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Escano soils are in valley basins.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium, weathered mostly from granitic rocks.  Most of this soil has been land leveled, but was hummocky in its natural landscape.  Elevations are 90 to 110 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

Elnido soils are coarse-loamy.  Kesterson soils have a natric horizon.  Palazzo soils have organic matter that decreases irregularly and lacks carbonates within 20 inches of the surface."

These soils were previously very poorly drained and ponded with stagnant water for extended periods during winter and spring months and are now ponded for periods of 2 to 7 days from December to February.  The water table is now 3.5 to 5 feet December through February.  The soils are now artifically drained or have had their water source intercepted.  They are protected from major flooding by large flood control levees and reservoirs."

These soils are being differentiated by having a mollic epipedon and a calcic horizon which are not characteristic of the Temple series.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method. Calcium carbonate equivalent determined by HCl method.  ESP determined by versinate method.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
