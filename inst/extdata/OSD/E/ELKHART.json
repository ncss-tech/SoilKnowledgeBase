Ashdale and Ripon soils have limestone bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (5 feet).  Broadwell, Dinsdale, Meadowbank, Mendota, Mickle, Ogle, Parkway, Plano, Proctor, Richwood, Sidell, Tecumseh, Toddville and Waupecan soils have more than 8 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Douglas, Healing, Lycurgus, Malcolm, Osco, Tama, and Wakenda soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).  Elmont soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) in weathered shale.  Gymer soils formed in silty alluvial of Loveland age. Sibley soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 61 cm (24 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elkhart soils are on uplands and on high stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous loess.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches).  Frost free period range from 160 to 180 days and elevation ranges from 152 to 305 meters (500 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Osco soils and the Buckhart, Harco, Sylvan, and Tallula soils.  Osco soils are in similar positions on the landscape nearby, and commonly are upslope where the loess is leached more deeply.  The Buckhart soils are in similar positions on the landscape, have a shallower seasonal high watertable and are leached more deeply.  The somewhat poorly drained Harco soils are in less sloping positions on the landscape and form a drainage sequence with Elkhart soils.  Sylvan soils are in similar positions on the landscape and do not have a mollic epipedon.  They form a bio-sequence with Elkhart soils.  Tallula soils are typically in positions downslope from Elkhart soils.  They contain less clay in the subsoil and do not have an argillic horizon."

These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 122 TO 183 CM (4 to 6 feet) at some time between February and April in most years.  The potential for surface water runoff is low on the lesser slopes and medium on the steeper slopes.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."
