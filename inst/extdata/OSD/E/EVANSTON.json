The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to free carbonates is 8 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  Gravel throughout the soil profile is 0 to 20 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is typically loam but some pedons are sandy loam fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures are clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon is normally neutral or slightly alkaline but may be slightly acid in the upper part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures are sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  It is slightly through strongly alkaline.  This horizon has 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
