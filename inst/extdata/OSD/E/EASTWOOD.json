  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chickasaw, Colbert, Etoile, Kellison, Lorman, Oakhurst, Oula, Rayburn, and Woodtell series in the same family and the Kipling, Moswell, Wilcox and Woodville soils in closely related families. All the competing series have aluminum saturation less than 45% in the control section. Colbert and Lorman soils have a higher clay content in the lower horizons and substratum. In addition the Colbert soils are underlain by limestone bedrock. Lorman soils are very slowly permeable in the substratum and are in a higher rainfall area than the Eastwood soils. Etoile soils are more alkaline formed in marl. They also have lower woodland productivity potential. Kipling soils typically have a more yellowish subsoil. The Oula soils typically have a more grayish subsoil. Rayburn soils formed in tuffaceous sandstone. Wilcox soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons. Woodtell soils have slightly higher reaction in the lower part of the Bt horizon, less annual rainfall, and lower woodland productivity potential than the Eastwood soils. The Moswell soils are members of the very-fine textural family and have conductivity greater than 2. Woodville soils have sola thicker than 60 inches and frost-free rainfall is 30 to 42 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eastwood soils are on gently sloping interstream divides and on moderately steep sideslopes adjacent to drainageways. These soils mainly formed in loamy and shaly sediments of the Wilcox group of the Tertiary System. Slopes are typically 1 to 12 percent but range to 20 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 64 to 68 degrees F., average annual precipitation from 45 to 52 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E index from 70 to 84. Summer moisture deficit ranges from 4 to 6 inches and frost-free precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elrose, Keithville, Latex, Metcalf, Meth, Sacul, Scottsville, and Wrightsville series. Elrose soils have a fine-loamy control section. Elrose, Meth, and Sacul soils are on slightly higher positions. Meth soils lack vertic properties, do not ahve shal strata within a depth of 60 inches and have mixed clay mineralogy. The fine-silty Keithville soils are on similar or slightly higher positions. Latex and Scottsville soils are on slightly higher positions and have a brownish fine-loamy upper subsoil. The fine-silty Metcalf soils are on slightly lower nearly level positions. Sacul soils formed in the acid Claiborne geologic materials and are Ultisols. Wrightsville soils are on lower slightly concave positions, and have aquic conditions and matrix colors with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches."

Native vegetation includes loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, southern red oak, sweetgum and hickory, mid and tall grasses such as indiangrass, pinehill bluestem, longleaf uniola and panicums. American beautyberry, sumac, greenbriar and hawthorn species are part of the understory. Improved pastures consist mainly of bermuda and bahiagrasses with crimson and arrowleaf clovers."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Eastwood soils were formerly included in the Woodtell series and the coined name reflects an eastern version of the Woodtell series. The classification was changed from a Vertic Hapludalf to a Chromic Vertic Hapludalf in 1999. The drainage class was changed from moderately well to well in 2002 to agree with the wetness interpretations. The series was updated in 2004 to no longer require grayish relic iron depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon, and to allow the BCt horizon to remain clayey in pedons that have geologic material (Cd) within a depth of 60 inches. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 8 inches, the A horizon and the E/B or E horizon, when present\nAbrupt textural change - at 8 inches deep (top of the Bt1 horizon).+\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 8 inches to about 51 inches includes the Bt and BC horizons.\nVertic properties - COLE of 0.09 to 0.14 and PLE greater than 2.5 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Harrison County, Texas: TAMU Soil Characterization lab numbers S84TX203-5 through S84TX203-10, and S85TX203-02.
