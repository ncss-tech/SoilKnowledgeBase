  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weathered soft chalky shale and limestone is 10 to 20 inches.  Carbonates typically are at the surface, but some pedons are leached 1 or 2 inches.  The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 35 percent clay and typically less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Shale fragments range from 0 to 50 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 80 percent.  Some pedons have AC horizons.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Typically, it has stains or mottles with value of 4 to 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6 along cracks and bedding planes.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 85 percent."

Slope gradients, typically, are greater than 9 percent but range from 2 to 40 percent. These soils formed in silty residuum weathered from soft chalky shales and limestone. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 48 degrees F, and precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches."
