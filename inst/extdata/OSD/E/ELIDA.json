  "OVERVIEW": "The Elida series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy, eolian and alluvial sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on gently undulating plains. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F). Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.",
