  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eaglesnest soils are on linear or convex slopes on till plains and till-mantled bedrock uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. They formed in a mantle of loamy material and underlying dense till. The till was deposited by the Rainy Lobe. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 27 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1400 to 1900 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Babbitt soils are on less sloping areas. The very poorly drained Cathro soils formed in organic materials and are in depressions. The well drained Cloquet soils formed in a mantle of loess and underlying outwash. The well drained Conic and moderately well drained Wahlsten soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Well drained Eveleth soils are on more steeply sloping areas. Moderately well drained Soudan soils have a sandy mantle."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon); Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 41 inches (Bw and 2BC horizons); Oxyaquic subgroup - saturated above a depth of 40 inches.\nThis soil was formerly recognized as a moderately well drained phase of the Eveleth series.\nPlacement is tentative. These soils may classify as Spodosols if the chemical requirement is met. Albic horizons are in less than 50 percent of all pedons based on field documentation. Lab data will be obtained in the future.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record number MN0812.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
