  "OVERVIEW": "The Eaglesnest series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a mantle of loamy material and the underlying dense till. They are on till plains and till mantled bedrock uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

They formed in a mantle of loamy material and underlying dense till. The till was deposited by the Rainy Lobe. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 27 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1400 to 1900 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Babbitt soils are on less sloping areas. The very poorly drained Cathro soils formed in organic materials and are in depressions. The well drained Cloquet soils formed in a mantle of loess and underlying outwash. The well drained Conic and moderately well drained Wahlsten soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Well drained Eveleth soils are on more steeply sloping areas. Moderately well drained Soudan soils have a sandy mantle."

These soils may classify as Spodosols if the chemical requirement is met. Albic horizons are in less than 50 percent of all pedons based on field documentation. Lab data will be obtained in the future."
