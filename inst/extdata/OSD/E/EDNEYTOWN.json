  "OVERVIEW": "The Edneytown series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on ridges and side slopes of the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130).  They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from felsic to mafic, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Slopes range from 2 to 95  percent.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clymer, Edgemont, Gladstone, Joanna, Millstone, Pennval (T), Pigeonroost, Shelocta, Syenite, and Wist (T) series. There are approximately 42 closely related series in different CEC classes or with no CEC class currently assigned. Clymer soils are deep to a lithic contact of sandstone. siltstone, or shale. Edgemont soils formed in residuum weathered from quartzite rocks and contain fragments of those rocks. Gladstone soils have 5YR color in the Bt and are found in the Highlands sections of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Joanna soils have redder hues throughout the solum and formed in Triassic materials. Millstone soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces of the Ohio River and have thicker argillic horizons. Pennval and Shelocta soils formed in colluvium from shale, siltstone, and sandstone and contain fragments of these rocks. Pigeonroost soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Syenite soils have a lithologic discontinuity of loess over residuum. Wist soils formed from fluvial marine sediments containing glauconite on the Northern Coastal Plain."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edneytown soils are on gently sloping to very steep ridges and side slopes of low and intermediate mountains of the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Slopes are typically between 15 and 50 percent but range from 2 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,200 to 4,500 feet. They formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from felsic to mafic high-grade metamorphic or igneous rocks such as granodioritic gneiss, and hornblende gneiss. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 80 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 59 degrees F, and the average frost free season ranges from 160 to 205 days."

Evard and Cowee soils are 5YR or redder. Clifton soils have a fine particle size class. Ashe, Chestnut, Cleveland, Edneyville, Plott, Porters, and Unaka soils do not have an argillic horizon. Peaks soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle size family. Saluda soils have a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock at  less than 20 inches. Rabun soils have argillic horizon with value 3 or less and are in a fine particle-size class. Saunook, Trimont, Thunder, Toecane, and Tusquitee soils have thick surface horizons with Humic features. Huntdale, Plott, Porters, and Unaka have umbric epipedons. All these soils formed on ridges and side slopes except Saunook, Thunder, Toecane, and Tusquitee soils which are on colluvial benches, toe slopes, and fans. Also, Huntdale, Plott, Porters, Trimont, and Unaka soils are on ridges and side slopes of cooler, north to east aspects."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as Edneyville. Edneyville is presently described without an argillic horizon and normally occurs at higher elevations.\nThe 1/98 revision places the Edneytown series in an active CEC activity class per the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996). The CEC activity class placement is based on sample pedon S90-NC-121-007 and on placement of similar soils such as Pigeonroost and Edneyville. Horizon depths and runoff class were also revised at this time.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 6 inches (Oi, Oe, A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 31 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nMLRA: 130 SIR(s): SC0005, SC0128 (VERY STONY), SC0142 (GRAVELLY)\nRevised: 2/92-ECH-RLV; 1/98-DHK; 5/01, 2/02-MKC\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
