The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summer and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches (889 to 1,016 millimeters), some of which falls as snow. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F (10.0 to 12.8 degrees C). The mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F (2.2 degrees C). The mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F (22.2 degrees C). The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife, and watershed. This soil is capable of supporting both meadow and woodland plant communities. Encroachment of woodland species, particularly, Ponderosa pine and incense cedar, increases the rate of summer drawdown so that an anaerobic hydrology is supplanted by an aerobic hydrology culminating in the development of an open canopy woodland plant community with an understory of grasses and forbs. The degree to which soil water is aerated is also influenced by the lateral, subsoil flow of aerated water into the floodplain soil from both up-valley and side-valley sources."
