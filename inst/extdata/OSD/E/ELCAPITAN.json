  "OVERVIEW": "The Elcapitan series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stream alluvium weathered from granitoid rock and reworked lake sediments. Elcapitan soils are on relict point bars, well defined bars and channels, scour channels, abandoned channels with year-round pools, intermediate flood plains, in mountain valleys. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches (940 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F (11.7 degrees C).",

Encroachment of woodland species, particularly, Ponderosa pine and incense cedar, increases the rate of summer drawdown so that an anaerobic hydrology is supplanted by an aerobic hydrology culminating in the development of an open canopy woodland plant community with an understory of grasses and forbs. The degree to which soil water is aerated is also influenced by the lateral, subsoil flow of aerated water into the floodplain soil from both up-valley and side-valley sources."
