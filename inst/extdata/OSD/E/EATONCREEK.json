The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean winter is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic soil moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock and thickness of the umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches.  The solum has andic soil properties with 35 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 6 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 30 to 60 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.5 percent.  The solum has 2 to 8 cmol/kg aluminum.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial silt loam, very gravelly medial silt loam, or very gravelly medial loam.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 10 to 30 percent organic matter."
