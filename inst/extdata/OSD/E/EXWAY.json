    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 19 to 39 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid except where the surface has been limed. Limed soils typically range from moderately acid to neutral in the Ap horizon. Dark manganese oxide concretions range from none to common throughout the profile. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 14 percent in the A and B horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 6. Mottles in shades of yellow, brown or red are present in some pedons. The Bt horizon is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles in shades of yellow, gray, red or brown are present in some pedons. The BC horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored weathered slightly fractured siltstone and mudstone."

Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 25 percent but range from 2 to 45 percent. They formed in residuum weathered from Triassic sedimentary rocks. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 48 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Wadesboro soils, and the Brickhaven, Carbonton, Creedmoor, Green Level, Mayodan, Peakin, Pinoka, Polkton, and White Store soils. All of these soils except Wadesboro lack rhodic colors.  The moderately well drained Brickhaven soils and the somewhat poorly drained Carbonton soils lack redox depletions and can occur on the same landscape.  Creedmoor soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and occur on lower elevations on the landscape on gently sloping to strongly sloping ridges.  The somewhat poorly drained Green Level and the moderately well drained Polkton and White Store soils have very slow permeability, very high shrink-swell potential, and occur on nearly level to moderately steep uplands.  Mayodan soils lack rhodic colors.  Peakin soils have redox depletions below 40 inches.  Pinoka sails fine-loamy.  Wadesboro soils have rhodic colors and soft bedrock at 40 to 60 inches."
