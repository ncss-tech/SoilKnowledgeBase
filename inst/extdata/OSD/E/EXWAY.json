  "OVERVIEW": "The Exway Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridges and side slopes of the Piedmont uplands. They formed in residuum weathered from Triassic rocks of mudstone and siltstone. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 48 inches and mean annual air temperature is 61 degrees F. near the type location.",

Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid except where the surface has been limed. Limed soils typically range from moderately acid to neutral in the Ap horizon. Dark manganese oxide concretions range from none to common throughout the profile. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 14 percent in the A and B horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 6. Mottles in shades of yellow, brown or red are present in some pedons. The Bt horizon is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles in shades of yellow, gray, red or brown are present in some pedons. The BC horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored weathered slightly fractured siltstone and mudstone."

All of these soils except Wadesboro lack rhodic colors.  The moderately well drained Brickhaven soils and the somewhat poorly drained Carbonton soils lack redox depletions and can occur on the same landscape.  Creedmoor soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and occur on lower elevations on the landscape on gently sloping to strongly sloping ridges.  The somewhat poorly drained Green Level and the moderately well drained Polkton and White Store soils have very slow permeability, very high shrink-swell potential, and occur on nearly level to moderately steep uplands.  Mayodan soils lack rhodic colors.  Peakin soils have redox depletions below 40 inches.  Pinoka sails fine-loamy.  Wadesboro soils have rhodic colors and soft bedrock at 40 to 60 inches."

Complete characterization data is available for the typical pedon - NSSL Pedon No. 90P0603.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 4 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone between depths of 4 and 19 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - the occurrence of soft bedrock at a depth of 24 inches (upper boundary of Cr horizon)"
