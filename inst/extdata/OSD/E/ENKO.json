    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kerrfield, Linco, Orovada, Patter, Prineville, and Ultramont series.\nKerrfield soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Orovada soils do not have a horizon with firm consistence in the matrix and a brittle manner of failure. Linco, Patter and Ultramont soils are moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October. Prineville soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have 5 to 30 percent sand-size pumiceous ash grains in the upper part of the soil."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,250 to 2,075 meters in Nevada and Oregon, and range to 825 meters on north slopes in Idaho.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."
