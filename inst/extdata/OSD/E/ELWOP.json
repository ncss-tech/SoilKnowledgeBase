  "OVERVIEW": "The Elwop series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over residuum derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Elwop soils are on fan remnants, plateaus, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   Depth to the base of the Bt horizon ranges from 12 to 31 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 12 to 34 inches.  Percent rock fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent soft sandstone that generally break down with pretreatment.  Average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has textures of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and may have subhorizons with hue of 5YR.  It has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy clay loam.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent sand, with 35 to 50 percent being fine and coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loamy sand or fine sandy loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nA C horizon occurs in some pedons.  It is typically slightly effervescent with less than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, but may be noneffervescent in some pedons.   It has properties similar to the Bk horizon except that it does not have secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft, effervescent sandstone or interbedded sandstone and shale.  The bedrock is commonly inconsistently effervescent or noneffervescent below the upper 10 to 15 inches of this horizon."

Augustine, Celacy, Dermala, Goesling, Lykorly, Maia, Pinitos and Ribera soils are presumed to be competing pending an update of the classification.  Arwite, Augustine, Dalhart, Deekay, Dermala, Flugle, Fort Collins, Goesling, Iwela, Lykorly, Maia, Olnest, Orlie, Parkelei, Pinitos, Rauzi, Stoneham and Wagonhound soils are very deep. Bosonoak soils occur above elevations of 6500 feet and receive most of their precipitation between July and October.  Celavar, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Celacy soils are moist in some parts of the moisture control section during the 120 days following the winter solstice.  Gateson soils have an E&B horizon.  Oldwolf soils have 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section. Toluca\nsoils have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations at 10 inches or less.  Rockybutte soils are moderately deep to porcellanite."

They formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over residuum derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
