  "OVERVIEW": "The Elfrida series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks with some influence from limestone. Elfrida soils are on alluvial fans, lower valley slopes, flood plains, and valley plains near old lake margins. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

Elevations are 3,800 to 4,600 feet. Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent and range from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks with some influence from limestone. The climate is warm semiarid continental. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches and occurs mainly as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle rains in the fall and winter. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 230 days."
