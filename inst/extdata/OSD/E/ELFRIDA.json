Pandale, Ratliff, and San Jon soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.  Kahn and Salado siols have less than 1 percent organic matter in the surface horizons.  Chispa soils have textures that have more than 35 percent sand (silt clay loam, fine silt loam, loam, clayloam).  Laborcita soils have more than 15 percent gravel.  Tuzigoot soils have calcium carbonate concretions throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elfrida soils are on level to nearly level alluvial fans, lower valley slopes, flood plains, and valley plains near old lake margins. Elevations are 3,800 to 4,600 feet. Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent and range from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks with some influence from limestone. The climate is warm semiarid continental. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches and occurs mainly as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle rains in the fall and winter. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 230 days."
