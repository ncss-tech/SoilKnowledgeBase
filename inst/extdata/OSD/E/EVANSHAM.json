  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Evansham series are very deep and poorly drained.  They have slow permeability.  They formed in depressions and scour channels on flood plains in alluvial materials that weathered from limestone, shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Slickensides - in the zone from 8 to 39 inches (A1, A2, and Cg1 horizons).\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). CEC class based on NASIS data from Augusta County, Virginia. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
