Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 22 inches (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons).\nb.  Slickensides - in the zone from 8 to 39 inches (A1, A2, and Cg1 horizons).\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). CEC class based on NASIS data from Augusta County, Virginia. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
