  "OVERVIEW": "The Escabosa series of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from limestone and stone. Escabosa soils are on ridge crests and hill slopes. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 140 to 180 days.",

Depth to the Cca horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or clay loam or their cobbly counterparts.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam and averages 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 7 through 9 dry, 6 through 9 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from loam to gravelly and cobbly heavy loam with 0 to 30 percent gravel and about 5 percent cobbles. This horizon ranges from loose to slightly hard. The pebbles and cobbles are coated with calcium carbonate."

Aut soils have a calcic horizon at depths of 6 to 15 inches. Beek soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick. Conlen soils have sola 60 or more inches thick. Dioxice soils lack bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Deama soils have bedrock within 20 inches. Dean and Harvey soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Hoverweep soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Mansic, Mansker and Portales soils have thermic temperature."
