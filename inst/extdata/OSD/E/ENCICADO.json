  "REVDATE": "03/1999",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Encicado series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Encicado soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",
