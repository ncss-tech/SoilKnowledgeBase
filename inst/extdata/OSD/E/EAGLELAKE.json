  "OVERVIEW": "The Eaglelake series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or andesite.  Eaglelake soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
