  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The particle-size control section is clayey with a weighted average clay content of 40 to 60 percent. Depth to calcium carbonate accumulations ranges from 25 to 50 inches. The soil cracks when dry. Cracks 1/2 inch or more wide in the top of the argillic horizon extend to a depth of more than 12 inches for 60 to 90 cumulative days in normal years. Slickensides and/or wedge shaped peds are in some subhorizon more than 6 inches thick within the argillic horizon. The combined thickness of the A and E horizons is dominantly less than 10 inches, however, the depth ranges from 3 inches on subsoil crests to 14 inches in some subsoil troughs. Some pedons do not have an E horizon, and in most areas that have been cultivated the E horizon has been incorporated into the Ap horizon. Redox features are considered relic or lithochromic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. The colors are variable within a distance of a few feet. Relic redox features or litho-chromic mottles in shades of red, brown, or gray range from few to common. Texture is clay.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid, however, in some subsoil crest the reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btss or Btkss horizon has matrix colors mainly in shades of brown, gray, or olive with relic redox features or litho-chromic colors in shades red, yellow, or gray. Some subhorizons are variegated with these colors. Calcium carbonate films, masses, or concretions range from none to few in the upper part, and from few to many in the lower part in most pedons. Texture is clay.  It is noneffervescent to strongly effervescent in cold, dilute HCl. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline, but may also be moderately acid in the upper part of the horizon in some pedons.\nA BCk or BCy horizon is present in some pedons.  Where present, it has color, texture, and reaction similar to that in the Btkss horizon, and has few to common calcium carbonate masses or nodules and accumulations of gypsum crystals.\nThe C or Ck horizon has colors in shades of gray, brown, or yellow. It is varigated, bedded, or platy shale, or marl and shale with clay loam or clay texture. Concretions, seams, and/or masses of calcium carbonate range from few to many in most pedons. Most pedons range from very slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent. Texture is clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chickasaw, Colbert, Kellison, Oakhurst, Oula, Rayburn, and Woodtell series in the same family, and the Eastwood, Lacerda Kipling, Lorman, Moswell, and Wilcox series in closely related families. Chickasaw soils are more acid throughout the lower part of the solum and are on steeper slopes. Cobert soils are underlain by limestone bedrock. Kellison, Oula, Rayburn, and Woodtell soils all are more acid in the upper part of the subsoil and are not moderately alkaline in the lower subsoil. Oakhurst soils formed in slightly acid to alkaline clayey tuffaceous materials that overlie siltstone and sandstone strata. Eastwood, Kipling, Lorman, and Wilcox soils all are more acid in the upper part of the subsoil and are not moderately alkaline in the lower subsoil. Lacerda soils are Vertisols and do not have an argillic horizon. Moswell soils have a very-fine particle-size control section and are more acid in the argillic horizon."

Slopes are mainly 1 to 3 percent but range to 20 percent. The soil is mainly on the Cook Mountain Geologic Formation. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 52 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 degrees 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 260. Elevation ranges from 200 to 420 feet above sea level. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 68 to 84."
