  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edwards soils are in closed depressions on outwash plains, lake plains, and ground moraines. Slope gradients are normally less than 2 percent, but range to about 6 percent on some toe slopes. Edwards soils formed in herbaceous organic materials overlying marly material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

These very poorly drained soils are on similar landform positions as Edward soils. Adrian, Antung, Houghton, Linwood, Moston, Palms, and Willette soils do not have marly materials. Madaus and Martisco soils have a thinner layer of herbaceous organic material overlying the marly material. Toto soils have a thicker layer of coprogenous material above the marly material"

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic material and moderately low in the marly material. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material and slow in the marly material."
