  "OVERVIEW": "The Eagleye series consists of well drained, slowly permeable, saline soils which are shallow to shale. Eagleye soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from shale and sandstone on footslopes and backslopes on escarpments, hills, ridges and structural benches. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
