They formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from Cretaceous shale and sandstone. Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,400 feet. The mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 14 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

Farview soils are very shallow to sandstone on structural benches.  Snapill soils are deep, fine-silty, and have argillic horizons on summits of mesas. Strych soils are very deep and loamy-skeletal, and occur on adjacent stable landslides above Eagleye soils.  Toadlena soils are loamy and shallow, have gypsic horizons, and occur on adjacent summits and footslopes of structural benches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 2 inches. (A horizon)\nNonacid reaction class - the lack of effervescence in all parts of the fine-earth fraction of the soil when treated with cold dilute HCL, and accompanied by pHs higher than 5.0.\nParalithic contact - The presence of soft shale bedrock at about 18 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Salinity values were determined on three pedons with a Wheatstone bridge.  The series type location has been sampled for determination of particle-size, SAR, soluble salts and calcium carbonate equivalence and analyzed at the BIA soils lab in Gallup, New Mexico as sample S87NM-045-7.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
