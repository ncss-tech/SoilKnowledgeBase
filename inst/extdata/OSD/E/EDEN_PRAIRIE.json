They formed in a coarse-loamy mantle and underlying sandy substratum. The sediments are glaciofluvial or eolian in origin. Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 32 inches. Frost free days range from 110 to 172. Elevations above sea level range from 700 to 1600 feet."
