  "OVERVIEW": "The Echocreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and shale.  Echocreek soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
