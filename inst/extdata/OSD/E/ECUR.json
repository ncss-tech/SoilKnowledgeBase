  "OVERVIEW": "The Ecur series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits with some loess influence.  Ecur soils are on lake terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The Eccles series has since been reclassified as Inceptisols.  The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data."
