Elevation ranges from 4,400 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 110 days."

Darkbull soils are on similar to slightly convex slopes as Ecur soils, are loamy-skeletal, and have a low sodium adsorption ratio.  Pyrat soils are on convex slopes above Ecur soils and are loamy-skeletal."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 6 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 6 to 15 inches (Bw horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 15 to 37 inches (Bkn1 and Bkn2 horizons).\nSodic feature - The zone from 15 to 40 inches (Bkn1 and Bkn2 horizons and part of the Cn1 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bkn1 and Bkn2 horizons and parts of the Bw and Cn1 horizons).\nThese soils were previously a part of the Eccles series.  The Eccles series has since been reclassified as Inceptisols.  The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
