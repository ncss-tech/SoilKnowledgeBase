  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for at least half the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for over 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum is neutral to strongly alkaline, increasing in alkalinity with increasing depth.  Depth to lime ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay and averages 40 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam and averages 0 to 25 percent coarse fragments of mixed origin including weathered diatomite.  Depth to the 3C horizon is deeper than 60 inches in some pedons and the amount of gravel ranges from 35 to 85 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Encina soils are on dissected slopes of terrace fronts, usually with southern aspects, at elevations of 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in lacustrine materials weathered from argillite, limestone, and diatomite with a thin overlay of volcanic ash and loess.  The climate is semiarid, with warm dry summers and cool moist winter.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The average January temperature about 27 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 90 to 130 days."

Brogan soils are fine-loamy.  Nagle soils are on north-facing slopes with frigid soil temperatures and are fine-loamy.  Powder soils are deep, silt loam soils on flood plains."
