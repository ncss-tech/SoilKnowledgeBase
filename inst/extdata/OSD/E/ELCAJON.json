Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 100 to 150 days.

The excessively drained Namur soils occur in areas where the depth to bedrock is less than 25 cm (10 inches). The well drained Summerville soils occur in areas where the depth to bedrock is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches)."
