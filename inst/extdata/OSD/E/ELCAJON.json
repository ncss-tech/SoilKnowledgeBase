  "OVERVIEW": "The Elcajon series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy loam or loam till underlain by karst limestone on ground moraines and glacial lake benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",
