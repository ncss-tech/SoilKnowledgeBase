  "OVERVIEW": "The Emagert series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and pyroclastic materials.  Emagert soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
