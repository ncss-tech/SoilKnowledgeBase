  "OVERVIEW": "The Eagreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, volcanic breccia and dacite. Eagreek soils are on dissected plateaus. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Base saturation is less than 60 percent between depths of 25 and 75 cm. Clay content in the control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Paragravel (2 to 5 mm size) range from 15 to 30 percent and decrease in abundance with depth.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.
