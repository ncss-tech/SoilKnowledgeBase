Clay content in the control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Paragravel (2 to 5 mm size) range from 15 to 30 percent and decrease in abundance with depth.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, and 4 or 6 moist. Texture is very paragravelly loam or extremely paragravelly loam.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eagreek soils are on dissected plateaus at elevations of 1,800 to 2,100 feet. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, volcanic breccia and dacite. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and wet. The mean annual precipitation is 42 to 47 inches. The average January temperature is 29 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
