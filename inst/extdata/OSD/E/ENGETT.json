  "OVERVIEW": "The Engett series consists of deep or very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian material from mixed sources influenced by local alluvium.  Engett soils are on undulating basalt plains.  Permeability is rapid.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Blacksan soils are on convex positions.  Eginbench soils are on lower river terraces and have an induced water table.  Juniperbute soils are adjacent to sand dunes and lack organic carbon to meet mollic criteria.  Sandcreek soils are shallow and are adjacent to rock outcrops on convex positions.  St. Anthony soils are on lower river terraces and are moderately deep to sand and gravel."
