Chenoa soils average less than 8 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper part of the particle-size control section. Clarence and Strole soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Martinton soils average less than 27 percent clay in some subhorizon in the lower part of the series control section. In addition, the sand fraction of the Martinton soil is predominantly fine or very fine."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elliott soils are on relatively undissected parts of till plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slope gradients range from 0 to 7 percent. The soils typically formed in silty clay loam till with a surface mantle of loess or other silty material ranging from 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) thick. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1067 mm (31 to 42 inches), frost-free period ranges from 145 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 165 to 311 meters (541 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ashkum, Beecher, Blount, and Varna soils. The moderately well drained Varna soils and the poorly drained Ashkum soils form a hydro-sequence with Elliott soils. Ashkum soils are on lower landform positions and Varna soils are on higher landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Beecher and Blount soils form a biosequence with Elliott soils and are on similar parts of landforms. Blount soils have a light colored surface layer, and Beecher soils lack the required surface layer thickness for a mollic epipedon."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second).   Permeability is slow. An intermittent perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) at some time between January and May in most years."
