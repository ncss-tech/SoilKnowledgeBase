  "OVERVIEW": "The Elliott series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on till plains. They formed in up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying silty clay loam till. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Beecher and Blount soils form a biosequence with Elliott soils and are on similar parts of landforms. Blount soils have a light colored surface layer, and Beecher soils lack the required surface layer thickness for a mollic epipedon."
