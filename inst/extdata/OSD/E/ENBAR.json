  "OVERVIEW": "The Enbar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, drainageways, and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
