  "OVERVIEW": "The Estaban series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from latite and dacite. Estaban soils are on backslopes of canyons. Slopes are 45 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
