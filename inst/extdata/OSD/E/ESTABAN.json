Elevation ranges from 8,000 to 9,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Tschicoma soils are fine-loamy, have an argillic horizon, and occur on toeslopes of valley sides.  Urioste soils are very shallow, do not have subsurface diagnostic horizons, and occur on south-facing backslopes of canyons."
