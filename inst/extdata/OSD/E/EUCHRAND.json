The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 10 to 20 inches. Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 50 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 160 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 60 to 120 days."

Rilea and Yorel soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  In addition, the Yorel soils are fine-loamy. Pyrady soils have argillic horizons, are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, and are moderately well drained.  Stackyards soils occur on north-facing side slopes of mountains, are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, and have umbric epipedons 10 to 20 inches thick.  Zalea soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock, have argillic horizons, and are fine-loamy."
