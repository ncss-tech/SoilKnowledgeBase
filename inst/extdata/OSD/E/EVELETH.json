Rock fragment content ranges 35 to 60 percent, by volume, in the series control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragment content averages 15 to 35 percent by volume with 2 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 2 to 25 percent stones and 0 to 25 percent boulders.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 1 to 3 inches thick with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Rock fragment content averages 15 to 35 percent by volume with 2 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 2 to 25 percent stones and 0 to 25 percent boulders. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  E horizons occur in less than half of all pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.

Rock fragment content averages 15 to 35 percent by volume with 2 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 2 to 25 percent stones and 0 to 25 percent boulders.  Lower subhorizons contain up to 45 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragment content averages 35 to 60 percent by volume with 15 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobbles, 0 to 15 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eveleth soils are on linear or convex slopes on till plains and till-mantled bedrock uplands.  Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent.  They formed in a mantle of loamy material and underlying dense till.  The till was deposited by the Rainy Lobe.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 27 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.  Elevation above sea level is 1400 to 1900 feet."

The very poorly drained Cathro soils formed in organic deposits and are in depressions.  The well drained Conic and moderately well drained Wahlsten soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  The moderately well drained Eaglesnest soils are on less sloping areas.  The well drained Cloquet soils formed in a loamy mantle and underlying outwash."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon); Cambic horizon - the zone from  3 to 36 inches (Bw and 2BC horizons); densic contact at 36 inches.\nPlacement is tentative.  These soils may classify as Spodosols if the chemical requirement is met.  Albic horizons are in less than 50 percent of all pedons based on field documentation.  Lab data will be obtained in the future. 2/11/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  For results of some laboratory analysis refer to MAES Central File Code #4229.
