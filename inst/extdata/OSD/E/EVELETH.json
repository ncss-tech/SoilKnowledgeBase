  "OVERVIEW": "The Eveleth series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of loamy material and underlying dense glacial till.  They are on till plains and till-mantled bedrock uplands.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow or very slow.  Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

These soils may classify as Spodosols if the chemical requirement is met.  Albic horizons are in less than 50 percent of all pedons based on field documentation.  Lab data will be obtained in the future. 2/11/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected."
