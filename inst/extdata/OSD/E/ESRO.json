    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to stratified alluvium is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.\nfrom early May 1 to mid November and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid June to mid October.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is dry for 60 days from early August to early October and is moist in all or some part the rest of the year.  The particle-size control section is 60 to 75 percent silt and very fine sand.  Clay content is 18 to 25 percent in the upper part and 18 to 30 percent in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  The mollic epipedon range from 22 to 40 inches thick.  The soil is mottled below 9 inches.  Organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon ranges from very dark gray and gray to olive gray (10YR and 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; N 3/0, N 4/0, N 5/0).  Moist color ranges from black to dark olive gray (10YR and 5Y 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2; N 2/0, N 3/0).  It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam, and is slightly acid or neutral and is 18 to 30 percent clay.  Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 22 to 37 inches.  Redoximorphic features range from few to common.\nThe C horizon ranges from gray, grayish brown and brown to pale olive and pale yellow (10YR and 5Y 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3).  Moist colors range from black to dark grayish brown and olive gray (10YR and 5Y 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/1, 4/2).  Redoximorphic features range from few to many, fine to large and faint to prominent.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe upper part of the C horizon is weakly to strongly gleyed.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam and sandy clay loam and clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  The lower part of the C horizon is stratified sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam and clay content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Thin sand strata are in the lower part of the C horizon in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 60 percent and are mostly gravel size."

Fury soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section and distinct or prominent mottles beginning at a depth of 5 to 10 inches.  They also lack a C horizon.  Quam soils have segregated carbonates at a depth below 20 inches."

Slopes are mostly less than 2 percent.  Elevations are 4,500 to 6,200 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches.  Snowfall is 10 to 20 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 63 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

The soils are rare to frequently rare to flooded for periods of 1 to 3 months from January to July.  The water table fluctuates from the surface to depths greater than 48 inches throughout the year.  The water table is usually at the surface to a depth of 12 inches from December through August.  During the months of September, October and November the water table drops to a depth of 12 to 20 inches.  In areas that are less wet flooding is rare and the water table ranges to depth of 24 to 48 inches during December through July and from 48 to below 60 inches during the rest of the year."
