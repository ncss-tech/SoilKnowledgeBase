  "OVERVIEW": "The Esro series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock and volcanic ash sources.  Esro soils are in basins and on basin terraces, low stream terraces and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is dry for 60 days from early August to early October and is moist in all or some part the rest of the year.  The particle-size control section is 60 to 75 percent silt and very fine sand.  Clay content is 18 to 25 percent in the upper part and 18 to 30 percent in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  The mollic epipedon range from 22 to 40 inches thick.  The soil is mottled below 9 inches.  Organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon ranges from very dark gray and gray to olive gray (10YR and 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; N 3/0, N 4/0, N 5/0).

It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam, and is slightly acid or neutral and is 18 to 30 percent clay.  Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 22 to 37 inches.  Redoximorphic features range from few to common.\nThe C horizon ranges from gray, grayish brown and brown to pale olive and pale yellow (10YR and 5Y 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3).

It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam and sandy clay loam and clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  The lower part of the C horizon is stratified sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam and clay content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Thin sand strata are in the lower part of the C horizon in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 60 percent and are mostly gravel size."
