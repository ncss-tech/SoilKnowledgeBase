  "OVERVIEW": "The Ephrata series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash mixed with loess in the upper part on outwash plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Ephrata soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches.  Solum thickness ranges from 16 to 30 inches and depth to the 2Ckq is 20 to 40 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments and less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand in the upper part and 50 to 85 percent coarse fragments in the lower part.  The solum is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak platy or granular structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is fine sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It has weak subangular blocky or weak prismatic structure.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 3 dry or moist, or color may be dominated by black basalt sand.\nThe 2C horizon is very cobbly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand or coarse sand."
