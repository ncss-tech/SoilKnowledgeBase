  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkhead series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Elkhead soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

(Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nRedoximorphic features:  Masses of iron accumulation from 38 to 75 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nEndosaturation:  an observed saturated zone below 38 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Seventh Edition, 1996.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The suborder would be Cumulic Oxyaquic if such a placement were available in soil taxonomy.  Calcium carbonate equivalent was determined at the project office using the calcimeter method.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
