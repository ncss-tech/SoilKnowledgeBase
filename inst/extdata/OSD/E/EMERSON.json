  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 65 degrees to 71 degrees F. Strongly contrasting textures are within 40 inches of the surface. The profile between depth of 10 inches and the underlying loose sand and gravel is dominantly fine sandy loam or sandy loam and averages less than 18 percent clay, less than 50 percent sand that is coarse than very fine sand.\nThe Ap horizon, or the upper 7 inches when mixed, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is platy, massive or weak very fine granular. This horizon is medium acid neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 2. It is commonly massive, but in some pedons, the C1 horizon, especially, has weak subangular blocky or weak coarse prismatic structure. This horizon is very friable or friable.  Most pedons lack lamellae and clay films. The C1 and C2 horizons are commonly neutral or slightly acid and are noncalcareous but are medium acid in some pedons. A thin layer (less than 5 inches) of loamy sand or other coarse texture is just above the underlying loose sand and gravel in some pedons. The underlying coarse sand or sand and gravel is single grained, loose, and mostly noncalcareous. It is variegated in some pedons."

Cencove and Marsing soils are calcareous throughout the 10- to 20-inch section. Clems, Jenness, Lolalita, and Timmerman soils lack strongly contrasting textures within 40 inches of the surface. Ephrata, Paniogue, and Timmerman soils have a cambic horizon and a Ca horizon.  Falk soils have mottles associated with wetness above depth of 40 inches. Jenness and Marsing soils are dominantly medium textured in the upper part of the control section. Notus soils have loose sand and gravel within 20 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are on low terraces alluvial fans and intermittent drainages. At elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived principally from granitic and related sources. The alluvium may contain minor quantities of basalt and rhyolite material. It is micaceous and noncalcareous. The climate is semiarid, with dry summers. Mean annual temperature is 51 degrees to 56 degrees F., frost-free period is 110 to 160 days, and mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, including 1 to 3 feet of snow."
