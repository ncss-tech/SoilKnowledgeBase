  "OVERVIEW": "The Edlin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium on fan aprons, pediments, and hill toeslopes and footslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 45  percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon and continuous accumulations of carbonate ranges from 10 to 23 inches.  Pebble content typically is 0 to 5 percent but ranges to 15 percent in some pedons.  The pebbles are rounded and mostly less than 1 inch in diameter.  Depth to any strongly contrasting material is over 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw (cambic) horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with clay content of 10 to 18 percent.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk (calcic) horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent noncarbonate clay.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 8 to 20 percent.  EC is 0 to 4 mmhos.  It is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons are loamy sand below 40 inches; others contain thin stratification.  EC is 0 to 4 mmhos.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Hawkstone soils are leached free of carbonates above 40 inches.  Sobson and Twilight soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Spang soils have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  Toby soils are noncalcareous above 30 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Edlin soils are alluvial fan aprons, toeslopes, and footslopes.  Slopes are mostly 3 to 10 percent but may range from 0 to 45 percent.  The alluvium is mixed and derived from primarily sedimentary rocks, but some fans contain material weathered from igneous beds.  Elevation is 5,800 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual temperature is about 37 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 110 days depending upon aspect and air drainage."
