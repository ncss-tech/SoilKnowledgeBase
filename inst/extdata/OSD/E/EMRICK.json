  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to about 40 inches in thickness.  The 10 to 40 inch control section typically is a loam averaging less than 18 percent clay.  Sandy loam layers 2 to 10 inches thick are in some pedons.  Pebbles and stones are common throughout the profile.  Stony phases are recognized.  The soil is neutral to mildly alkaline in the A and Bw horizons and mildly or moderately alkaline in the Bk and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has a 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 in the upper part and 1 or 2 in the lower part.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has a weak or moderate prismatic and subangular blocky structure.  The lower part of the Bw horizon and the Bk and C horizons are mottled in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam and has 10 to over 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is calcareous loam till with pockets of fine sand, silt and pebbles in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clontarf, Embden, Flathead, Inkster, Malachy, and Swenoda series in the same family and the Gardena, Heimdal and Svea series. Clontarf, Flathead and Malachy soils have sand or loamy sand textures at depths of less than 40 inches. Inkster soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits and contain more than 50 percent shale in the sand size fraction of the 10 to 40 inches control section. Embden soils have fine sandy loam series control section and formed in glaciofluvial deposits or glaciolacustrine sediments. Swenoda soils have 2C horizons within depths of 40 inches that are higher in silt. Heimdal soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick. Gardena soils are coarse-silty. Svea soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Emrick soils are on level to gently rolling low relief ground moraines.  They are on plane and slightly concave positions.  Slope gradients are commonly less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous glacial till low in clay and containing pockets of silts, fine sands and other sorted materials. The climate is cool, subhumid, with a mean annual temperature ranging from 38 to 43 degrees F, and a mean annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 22 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Barnes and Svea soils are on fine-loamy till plains in the same geographic area. Barnes soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick. Fram soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches and are somewhat poorly drained. Tonka soils are in the enclosed, poorly drained basins and have E and Bt horizons."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 inches (Ap, A, and Bw horizons).\nThe pedon meets the color requirement for the aquic subgroup in the horizon immediately below the mollic epipedon (Bk1 horizon), however the soil does not have aquic conditions immediately below the mollic epipedon and does not meet the subgroup criteria.  Saturation does not occur shallower than three feet.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
