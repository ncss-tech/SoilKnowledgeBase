  "OVERVIEW": "The Elispring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum weathered from red limestone conglomerate.  These soils occur on hills, ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
