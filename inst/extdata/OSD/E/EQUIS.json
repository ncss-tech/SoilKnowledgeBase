  "OVERVIEW": "The Equis series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments and alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Equis soils are on alluvial flats, floodplains and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
