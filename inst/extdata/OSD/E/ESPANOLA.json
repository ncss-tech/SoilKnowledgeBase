  "OVERVIEW": "The Espanola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Espanola soils are on risers of high stream terraces adjacent to valley floors. Slopes are 35 to 85 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
