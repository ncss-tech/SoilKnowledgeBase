Slopes are 35 to 85 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,700 to 8,400 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 40 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Fiesta soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons, and occur on footslopes of valley sides. Morenda soils are coarse-loamy, have water tables within 5 feet, and occur on low stream terraces of valley floors."
