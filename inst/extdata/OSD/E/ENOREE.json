  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral throughout the profile; however, some portion of the 10 to 40 inch control section has a pH of 5.5 or higher.  Flakes of mica range from none to many throughout the profile.  Content of coarse fragments range to as much as 2 percent in the A horizon and to as much as 7 percent throughout the rest of the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  When the hue is less than 3.5, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  It is silty clay loam, loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  Between the base of the A horizon and 30 inches, the material with chroma of 2 or less totals less than 60 percent of the matrix.\nThe Cg horizon commonly is stratified sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand with the particle-size control section averaging 10 to 18 percent clay. Below a depth of 30 inches, some pedons have buried horizons  with variable textures, and some pedons have 2C horizons withvariable textures."

Similar soils in other families are Bibb, Cartecay, Chewacla, Convent, Mantachie, and Wehadkee series.  Lilbourn soils are not as wet, flood less frequently, and have a 2Bb horizon.  Bibb soils have more acid and have siliceous mineralogy.  Cartecay and Chewacla soils have dominant colors with chroma of 3 or more.  Convent soils contain less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Mantachie and Wehadkee soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
