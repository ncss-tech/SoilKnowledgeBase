    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 36 to 102 cm (14 to 40 inches). The depth of a paralithic contact ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Coarse fragments of limestone flagstones, siltstone and shale range from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizons, 10 to 35 percent in the B horizons, and 25 to 75 percent in the C horizons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately alkaline in the sola, and mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline in the generally calcareous C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe A horizon (where present) has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silty clay or clay and less commonly silty clay loam and their flaggy analogues. Some pedons have few or common olive (5Y 5/3) through strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles.\nBA or BE horizons (where present) are less than 6 inches thick.\nThe BC horizon of most pedons has few to many olive gray (5Y 5/2) through reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) mottles with the 2 chroma mottles occurring at a depth of 10 inches or more below the top of the Bt horizon. Texture is silty clay or clay.  The BC horizon of some pedons has few or common thin clay films.\nSome pedons have a C horizon up to 15 inches thick that has hue of 5GY through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 14 with few to many mottles in shades of gray, olive, or brown. It is flaggy silty clay or flaggy clay, and their very flaggy or extremely flaggy analogues."

Beasley, Bledsoe, Enott, and Heitt soils have a paralithic contact greater than 102 cm (40 inches). Brashear, Bucklick, Elba, Estate, Lowell, and Vandalia soils have a lithic contact greater than 102 cm (40 inches). Bratton, Caneyville, Donahue, Faywood, Fredonia, and Haggatt soils have lithic limestone at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Bonnell, Cosperville, Heverlo, Jessup, Kewaunee, Milton, Mountpleasant, and Muncie soils have parts of the solum formed in glacial till.  Markland soils are formed in lacustrine sediments. Shrouts soils are formed dominantly in Silurian age interbedded calcareous shales, dolomite, and siltstone and contain fewer limestone fragments in the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eden soils are on hillsides and narrow ridgetops. Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent, but are dominantly 20 to 30 percent. The soil formed in residuum of interbedded soft calcareous shales and siltstones, with thin interbedded limestones. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40\nto 46 inches."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for pasture and hay, but some steeply sloping areas have reverted to forest or brushy pasture. Some broader ridgetops are used for tobacco, corn, and small grains. Native vegetation is hardwoods, chiefly species of oak, ash, elm, hickory, hackberry, and black walnut, black and honey locust; in places, red cedar. There were many glades of native grasses, sedges, and canes."
