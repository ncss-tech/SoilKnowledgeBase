    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eppenauer soils are on footslopes of fan remnants at elevations of 4,500 to 6,695 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. These soils formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone of the Tascotal Formation. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the annual total. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 61 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days."
