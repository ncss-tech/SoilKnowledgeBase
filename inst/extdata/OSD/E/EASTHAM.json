  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is more than 80 inches thick. The control section has an average clay content of 45 to 60 percent. Unless cultivated there is gilgai microrelief with microknolls about 6 to 10 inches higher than microdepressions. When dry, cracks 1 to 3 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 40 inches. The cracks are open for 60 to 90 cumulative days during normal years. Slickensides begin at a depth of 12 to 22 inches. The amplitude of waviness of mollic to nonmollic colors ranges from 20 inches thick on the microknolls to about 50 inches in the microdepression. Some microknolls have chimneys that do not have mollic colors. However, these make up less than 5 percent of most soil areas. Redox features or masses are considered to be relic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, values of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less. Thickness of the A horizon is variable due to microrelief, ranging from 6 inches on the microknolls to 22 inches in the microdepressions. It averages more than 12 inches thick in over half the pedon. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bss and Bkss horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Redox concentrations in shades of brown, yellow, or olive range from none to common. Redox concentrations are mainly in the Bkss horizons. Concretions, masses, and threads of calcium carbonate range from none to common. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Bss horizon, and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Bkss horizon.\nThe BCss or BCkss horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Redox concentrations in shades of brown, yellow and olive range from few to many. In some pedons the horizon is variegated in these colors. Concretions, masses and threads of calcium carbonate range from few to common. Gypsum crystals range from none to few. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Hallsbluff soils have dominent chroma of 2 within the upper 12 inches. Tinn soils are on lower flood plain positions and are calcareous throughout. Burleson soils have an Ustic soil moisture regime. Lake Charles soils are on alluvial plains and delta plains on the coast prairie and have less amplitude of waviness in the mollic epipedon. Tinn soils are on flood plains of streams that drain the Blackland Prairie and have less amplitude of waviness in the mollic epipedon. Laewest soils are in the hyperthermic temperature regime."

The average annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 46 inches and the Thornwaite P-E index ranges from 66 to 70.
