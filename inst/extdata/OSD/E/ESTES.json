  "OVERVIEW": "The Estes series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils.  These nearly level floodplain soils formed in acid clayey and loamy alluvium in the Coastal Plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F); mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).",
