  "OVERVIEW": "The Emory series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in local alluvium and the underlying buried soil.  They are in narrow strips along intermittent drainageways, on toe slopes and in bottoms of upland depressions.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the local alluvium over the buried solum ranges from about 20 to 45 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid in all horizons except where limed.  Pebbles and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent in the Ap, Bw and Ab horizons and 0 to 20 percent percent in the Btb horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 to 4.   It is silt loam or rarely silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btb horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay."

Ennis and Greendale soils have colors dominantly of 10YR hue, and lack dark epipedons.  Etowah soils have argillic horizons.  Greendale soils are also mesic."
