  "OVERVIEW": "The Essexville series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy material overlying loamy drift on lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
