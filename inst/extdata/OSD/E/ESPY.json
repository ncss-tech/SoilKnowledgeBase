  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carbine (AZ), Kimberson (T)(TX), Ozona (TX), Pitzer (TX), and Queeny (TX) series. Carbine soils have petrocalcic horizons thicker than 20 inches and less than 18 percent clay. Kimberson, Ozona, Pitzer and Queeny soils are moist in the soil moisture control section in May and June and occur in the Great Plains. Kimberson soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age and an underlying indurated caliche of Pliocene age. Ozona, Pitzer, and Queeny soils have mollic epipedons directly on indurated caliche. Queeny soils have unconsolidated material below the petrocalcic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Espy soils are on fans and ridges in intermountain valleys. The soils are nearly level to gently sloping. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The soils formed in loamy and gravelly sediments derived largely from areas of igneous rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranging from 12 to 25 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F. Frost free period range from 180 to 240 days, and elevation ranges from 4,500 to 6695 feet."

Brewster soils have sola less than 20 inches thick over consolidated volcanic bedrock and are on similar landscapes. Medley soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon and are in lower landscapes."
