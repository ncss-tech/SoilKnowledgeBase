  "OVERVIEW": "The Espy series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained soils that are moderately permeable in the upper part and very slowly permeable in the petrocalcic horizon. These gently sloping soils formed in loamy and gravelly sediments from igneous sources. These soils are on fans and ridges in intermountain valleys.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Carbine soils have petrocalcic horizons thicker than 20 inches and less than 18 percent clay. Kimberson, Ozona, Pitzer and Queeny soils are moist in the soil moisture control section in May and June and occur in the Great Plains. Kimberson soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age and an underlying indurated caliche of Pliocene age. Ozona, Pitzer, and Queeny soils have mollic epipedons directly on indurated caliche. Queeny soils have unconsolidated material below the petrocalcic horizon."
