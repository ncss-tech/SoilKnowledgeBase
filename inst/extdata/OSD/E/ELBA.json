  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 48 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 30 inches. The depth to a lithic or paralithic contact is 40 to 80 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly thin, flat fragments of limestone, nonacid siltstone and shale, and rounded limestone cobbles. Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent by volume in the A horizon, 0 to 35 percent in the Bt horizon, and 5 to 60 percent in the BC and C horizons. Individual subhorizons in the Bt horizon contain up to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have thin A horizons with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. E horizons are in some pedons. The A or Ap horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam except for some eroded pedons that range to silty clay or clay. It commonly is neutral to medium acid but ranges to mildly alkaline in pedons that are eroded.\nThe BE or BA horizons are in some pedons. The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons are mottled in the lower part, mainly due to color of parent rock. The Bt horizon is dominantly silty clay or clay or their shaly or channery analogues but subhorizons of silty clay loam or very channery analogues of those textures are permitted. It is medium acid to mildly alkaline in the upper part and neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Some pedons contain free carbonates in the lower part.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5Y, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 1 to 6; and are mottled in some pedons. They are silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their channery or very channery analogues. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains free carbonates. Bedrock is hard limestone, calcareous siltstone or shale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beasley, Bland, Bledsoe, Bonnell, Brashear, Bratton, Briggsville, Brookside, Bucklick, Caneyville, Chrome, Derinda, Donahue, Eden, Edenton, Eldean, Estate, Faywood, Fredonia, Hagerstown, Heitt, Kewaunee, Lamoille, Losantville, Lowell, Markland, Medary, Miamian, Milton, Newnata, Ozaukee, Shrouts, Upshur, Vandalia, Vincent, Woodsfield, and Wynn series in the same family and the Brooke series. Beasley soils have mottles of low chroma in the lower part of the solum. Bland, Caneyville, Chrome, Derinda, Donahue, Eden, Edenton, Faywood, Fredonia, Milton, Shrouts, and Wynn soils have lithic or paralithic contacts within 40 inches. Bledsoe soils formed in colluvial material from soils formed in residuum from limestone, shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Bonnell soils formed in loess and till. Brashear, Brookside, Bucklick, Estate, Heitt, Lowell, Medary, and Newnata soils lack carbonates within depths of 10 to 30 inches. Bratton, Hagerstown, Upshur, Vandalia, Vincent, and Woodsfield soils have 5YR or redder hues in all or part of their B horizons. Briggsville and Markland soils lack coarse fragments. Eldean soils have stratified sand and gravel in the lower part of the control section. Kewaunee, Losantville, Miamian, and Ozaukee soils typically contain less coarse fragments in their lower sola and have formed in glacial till. The Brooke soils have a lithic contact at depth of 20 to 40 inches and are in mollic subgroup."

Brooke and Lowell soils are in similar positions as Elba soils. Brookside soils are on foot slopes. Upshur and Belpre soils are on ridgetops, side slopes, and benches. Belpre soils have redder hue. Dekalb and Gilpin soils are on shoulders and back slopes and have low base saturation, lack carbonates, and are loamy. Westmore soils typically are on ridgetops and upper side slopes and are fine-silty."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Elba soils were formerly classified in the Brooke series in southeastern Ohio.\nThe 01/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data elements for Belmont and Washington Counties, Ohio, and on associated soils, but not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 6 inches (Ap)\nArgillic horizon - 6 to 30 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4).\nPrevious revision dates: 02/86-TNR, DRM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
