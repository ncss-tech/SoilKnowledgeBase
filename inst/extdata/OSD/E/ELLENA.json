    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT3006.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 0 to 7 inches (Oi, A horizons); a cambic horizon from 22 to 35 inches (E/Bw horizon); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 35 to 38 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 38 inches (R horizon).  Ellena soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
