  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ellena series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that are moderately deep to grus and hard granite bedrock.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from hard coarse grained granitic rocks deposited over granitic bedrock.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT3006.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 0 to 7 inches (Oi, A horizons); a cambic horizon from 22 to 35 inches (E/Bw horizon); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 35 to 38 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 38 inches (R horizon).  Ellena soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
