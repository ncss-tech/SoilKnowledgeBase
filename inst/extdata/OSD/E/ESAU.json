    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alpena, Detour, Ensign, Hessel, and Wheatley series. Alpena soils are excessively drained and are on higher landscape positions. Detour soils are finer textured throughout. Ensign soils are underlain by limestone bedrock at depths of 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 inches). Detour and Ensign soils are on similar landscape positions. Hessel and Wheatley soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained and are on slightly lower landscape positions."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high. Permeability is very rapid."
