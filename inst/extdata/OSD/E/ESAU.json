  "OVERVIEW": "The Esau series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in extremely gravelly sand or extremely flaggy sand on low beach ridges, swales, old shoals and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
