  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 44 degrees F.  Summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  Typically the soil is noncalcareous to depths in excess of 5 feet, but is very weakly calcareous below depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  Organic carbon ranges from 1 to 4 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The moisture control section is moist in most parts about half the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. at 20 inches depth.  The particle-size control section is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam, and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume and are mainly sandstone, flagstones and channers, but include basalt, gravel, and cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 through 3.  Typically the horizon has fine granular or crumb structure, but it grades to subangular blocky in the lower part in some pedons.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Textures range from loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Dry consistence is hard or slightly hard.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral with little or no increase in pH above 50 inches.  Textures are loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Auzqui (WY), Babb (MT), Bynum (MT), Dewville (CO), Irondyke (OR), Redcloud (CO), Tamp (CO), Tampico (NM), Teton (MT), Thayne (WY), Tilton (CO), Uhl (WY), and the Wrenman (WY) series.  Auzqui, Babb, Dewville, Redcloud, Thayne, and Tilton soils are calcareous within their control sections.  Bynum, Teton, and Wrenman soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tampico soils formed in sediments washed from granite and have 5 to 20 percent rock fragments, mainly of gravel size.  Irondyke soils have a xeric moisture regime, and formed from volcanic ash over glacial till.  Uhl soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Tamp soils lack flagstones and have moisture control sections that are dry in most parts about half the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. at 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Emerald soils are on alluvial fans and valley sideslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in alluvial sediments derived from sandstone, interbedded sandstone, shale, and basaltic materials.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches with generally uniform precipitation occurring throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature is 33 to 40 degrees F. and the frost-free season is less than 70 days."
