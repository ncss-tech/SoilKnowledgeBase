  "OVERVIEW": "The Everry series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium from calcareous siltstone on hills.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Everry soils have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
