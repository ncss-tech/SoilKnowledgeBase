The soils formed in loess and residuum and alluvium derived from igneous rock.  The soils formed in a continental climate having cool dry summers and cold wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
