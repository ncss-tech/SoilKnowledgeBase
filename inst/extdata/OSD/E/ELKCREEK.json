  "OVERVIEW": "The Elkcreek series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils on foothills and mountainsides.  They formed in loess and residuum and alluvium from andesite, rhyolite, welded tuft, or basalt.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
