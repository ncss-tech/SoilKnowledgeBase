  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elco soils are on side slopes and some ridge tops on loess covered till plains and moraines. Slope gradients are 1 to 25 percent. These soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Most pedons have a layer of silty or loamy pedisediment between the loess and till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches)."

Permeability is moderate in the loess, moderately slow in the pedisediment, and moderately slow or slow in the till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Seepy spots on side slopes are common as the result of perched water above the paleosol."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This pedon was relocated approximately 300 feet east of the previous type location by RAT- Springfield MLRA. Pedon number 97IL-167-026.\nElco soils have been correlated only as moderately well drained and have been used only in Illinois. At one time, the definition allowed for well-drained pedons also, but we now believe that they do not occur because of the influence of the paleosol on water movement in the solum. The 3Btg or 3Bt horizon of Elco soils is the lower part of the solum superimposed upon a Sangamon paleosol in the Illinoian till. Many of the properties of those horizons are believed to be inherited from the paleosol. The variability of the properties is related to the geologic truncation of the paleosol before it was buried by loess, and to the extent of modern soil development into the old materials. Some pedons have a dark-colored layer at the top of the paleosol that was the surface layer of the paleosol, and is now part of the 2Bt or 3Bt horizon of the modern soil. In pedons that do not have the pedisediment layer the Peoria loess lies directly on the paleosol. The paleosolic Bt horizon typically is gray, but ranges to brown in some pedons. Calcium and other bases have been replenished in the paleosol in some pedons after burial by loess by seepage from the mantling material up slope. It is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the modern solum from those of the paleosol in many pedons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 38 cm (15 inches) (Ap, E, and BE) horizons;\nargillic horizon - the zone from about 38 to 203 cm (15 to 80 inches) (Bt1, 2Btg1, 3Btg3, and 3Btg4 horizons;\ntwo lithologic discontinuities - one between the Peoria loess and the Roxana silts (pedisediment) at a depth of 66 cm (26 inches), and the other between the Roxana silts and the glacial till (paleosol) at a depth of 99 cm (39 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on pedon S70IL-167-001 is from a pedon within the same delineation as this typical pedon. Data from other pedons are on file at the Illinois NRCS State Office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
