These soils were studied as series C in the Classification of Soils in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina of September 1968.\nDecision made that this soil typically has saturation within 40 inches of the soil surface for a duration long enough to support the Oxyaquic subgroup. Reclassified accordingly in 2000.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 40 inches (A, E1, E2 and E3 horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 27 to 40 inches (E3 horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 40 to 50 inches (Bh horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nSC0033 ECHAW       0-  2   59- 70  190-275  38- 52    10- 100\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nSC0033 NONE          2.5-3.5  APPARENT NOV-APR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nSC0033  0- 5  LS LFS                  0-  0 100-100  5-10   1-  3\nSC0033  0- 5  S FS                    0-  0 100-100  1- 8   1-  3\nSC0033  5-40  LS FS S                 0-  0 100-100  2-10   1-  2\nSC0033 40-50  FS LS S                 0-  0 100-100  2-10   2-  4\nSC0033 50-65  LS FS S                 0-  0 100-100  2-10   1-  2\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
