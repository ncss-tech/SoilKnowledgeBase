  "OVERVIEW": "The Estelle series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of loess overlying friable to firm gravelly glacial till. Estelle soils are on glacial till plains and hills. Slopes range from 0 to 85 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",

The upper part of the control section formed in loess dominated by amorphous material. The lower part of the control section is loamy-skeletal and averages 35 to 65 percent hard rock fragments. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and slightly acid to neutral in the substratum. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 37 degrees F.\nThe E, and Eb horizon (where present) has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs, and Bsb horizon (where present) has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Total carbon is less than 6 percent. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bs and 2BC horizons (when present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.
