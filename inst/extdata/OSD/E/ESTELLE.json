Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and slightly acid to neutral in the substratum. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 37 degrees F.\nThe E, and Eb horizon (where present) has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs, and Bsb horizon (where present) has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Total carbon is less than 6 percent. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.
