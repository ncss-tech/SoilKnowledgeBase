  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the contrasting sand and\ngravel ranges from 15 to 32 inches.  The particle size control section is from 10 to 40 inches.  The upper part has a loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam matrix with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Total sand can range up to 60 percent.  The matrix may be modified with 5 to 35 percent rock fragments when averaged.  Pebbles range from 5 to 35 percent and cobbles from 0 to 10 percent.  The lower part of the particle size control has a loamy sand or sand matrix with an average of 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Pebbles range from 30 to 45 percent and cobbles 10 to 25 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7\ndry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos. Reaction is typically moderately alkaline but may range to mildly alkaline in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Matrix texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam when averaged and may be modified with 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.  Reaction is mildly through strongly alkaline.  Free carbonates are present in this horizon.\nThe Bk calcic horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Matrix texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam when averaged and may be modified with 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  EC is less than 4 mmhos.  Reaction is typically moderately alkaline but may range through strongly alkaline in some pedons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 0.6.  Texture of the matrix is loamy sand or sand modified with 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  This concentration of carbonates in this horizon ranges from 15 to 30 percent but may drop below 40 inches.  The upper 20 inches of this horizon always qualifies as a calcic horizon.  EC is less than 4 mmhos.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lieberman series in the same class and the similar Brownsto, Clifsand, and Crago series.  Lieberman soils have durinodes or lime-cemented sheets or both in the profile.  Brownsto soils are skeletal throughout the control section and are frigid.  Clifsand soils are skeletal throughout the control section.  Crago soils have carbonatic mineralogy and are frigid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Emblem soils are on dissected fan aprons, terraces, and on hill footslopes and toeslopes.  These soils formed in alluvium from high energy discharges overlain by alluvium finer in texture.  The alluvium is from mixed sources.  Elevations range from 3,800 to 6,400 feet.  The simple and complex slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and ranges from 6 to 9 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 degrees at higher elevations to 52 degrees at lower elevations.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 to 135 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
