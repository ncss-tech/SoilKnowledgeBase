  "OVERVIEW": "The Evanola series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in moderately fine textured calcareous alluvium derived from red siltstone, shale and sandstone of Triassic age. These soils are on hillslopes, alluvial fan terraces and valley side slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 381 mm (15 in), and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F).",
