Immanuel soils occur around the perimeter of the terrace; have fragic properties in the argillic and are moderately well drained. Stuttgart soils occur on slightly higher positions; are moderately well drained and contain an abrupt texture change. Tichnor soils occur on floodplains that drain the terrace; have A and E horizons greater than 24 inches thick and do not contain a glossic horizon."
