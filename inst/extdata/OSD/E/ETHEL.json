    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. These soils typically have more than 60 percent silt and less than 10 percent sand throughout. The glossic horizon extends deeply into the B horizon. Sodium saturation typically increases with depth and ranges from 5 to 10 percent in lower part of solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but where limed or affected by irrigation water it ranges to neutral. Iron accumulations are in shades of brown. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe E horizon and Eg part of the Btg/Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but where limed or affected by irrigation water, it ranges to neutral. Texture is silt or silt loam. Iron accumulations are in shades of brown.\nThe Btg horizon and Btg part of the Btg/Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, and gray. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Clay content ranges from 22 to 35 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BCg and Cg horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. Iron accumulations and depletions are shades of brown, yellow, and gray."

These soils formed in alluvium high in silt and low in sand, or mixture of loess and alluvium. The climate is warm and humid. The average annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 50 to 55 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Dewitt, Immanuel, Stuttgart and Tichnor series. Dewitt soils occur on similar landscapes. Dewitt soils are in a fine particle-size family and contain an abrupt texture change. Immanuel soils occur around the perimeter of the terrace; have fragic properties in the argillic and are moderately well drained. Stuttgart soils occur on slightly higher positions; are moderately well drained and contain an abrupt texture change. Tichnor soils occur on floodplains that drain the terrace; have A and E horizons greater than 24 inches thick and do not contain a glossic horizon."
