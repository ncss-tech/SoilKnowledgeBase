The soil moisture control section is dry from July to November (120 to 125 days).  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 50 percent clay.  Mineralogy is smectitic.  The soil is calcareous from 25 to 72 inches, (64 to 183 cm).  Surface-initiated reversible cracks 1 to 2 inches, (2.54 to 5 cm) wide extend to a depth of 31 inches, (79 cm) from about May 15 to October 15 (140 to 160 days) when the soil is not irrigated.  Intersecting slickensides range from common to many in the Bssg and Bsskg horizons from 8 to 50 inches, (20 to 127 cm).  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and 10 inches, (25 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through May.  Redoximorphic features such as reduced matrix occur in the overlying basin material and oxidized iron masses and manganese masses occur in the underlying loamy material.  Some pedons lack gleyed matrix colors.  In some pedons oxidized iron masses, manganese masses and/or iron-manganese concretions occur in the overlying basin material and iron-manganese concretions occur in the underlying loamy material.  Some pedons lack calcium carbonate accumulation.\nThe Ap horizon dry color is 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 4/2, 5/1 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1 or 3/2.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 55 percent.
