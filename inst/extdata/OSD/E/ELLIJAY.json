  "OVERVIEW": "The Ellijay series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on intermountain ridges and side slopes in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. These soils formed mainly in materials weathered from ultra mafic crystalline rocks which contain minerals such as olivine, serpentine, and talc. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches. Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction in the A horizon ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid, unless limed. The Bt, BC, and C horizons range from strongly acid to neutral. There is a substantial imbalance between exchangeable calcium and magnesium in the Bt, BC, and C horizons, unless it has been corrected by liming. Content of mica flakes ranges from none to common. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 15 percent in the lower horizons. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel, but cobbles and stones are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThin AB or BA horizons, where present, have hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4 or 6. They are silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4 or 6. The dry color value is 4. It is typically clay, but may include silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, have hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. They are loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon is multicolored or mottled in shades of red, yellow, or brown, and is saprolite that has textures of loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ellijay soils are on gently sloping to very steep intermountain ridges and side slopes in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.\nElevation ranges from about 2,000 to 3,500 feet. Slope is commonly between 8 and 30 percent but ranges from 2 to 70 percent. Ellijay soils formed in materials weathered from ultra mafic crystalline rocks that contain minerals such as olivine, serpentine, and talc. In Jackson County, N.C. they have formed in materials weathered from the Webster ring dike. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: There are no other tentative or established series mapped in association with Ellijay soils that are formed from ultra mafic parent material. (See remarks). Soils that formed from materials weathered from felsic or intermediate crystalline rocks are in nearby associated landscapes. These include Braddock, Clifton, Cowee, Dyke, Evard, Fannin, Hayesville, Saunook, and Trimont soils. None of these soils have a low exchangeable calcium to magnesium ratio, and all are Ultisols. Braddock and Dyke soils are on high stream terraces. Clifton, Cowee, Evard, Fannin, Hayesville, and Trimont soils are on mountain ridges and side slopes. Saunook soils are in colluvial positions in coves."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in forest. Common trees are Virginia pine, pitch pine, white oak, post oak, black oak, and scarlet oak. The understory plants include flowering dogwood, American holly, mountain-laurel, rhododendron, red maple, and greenbrier. In most areas, the native vegetation is suppressed by the low exchangeable calcium to magnesium ratio. A few areas are cleared and are used for pasture, hay, or residential areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Ellijay series was formerly included with the Braddock, Clifton, Dyke, Rabun, and Hayesville series. However, these soils are Ultisols, and do not form from ultra-mafic rocks. Also, they do not have the characteristic exchangeable calcium-magnesium imbalance of Ellijay soils, and are more productive for crops and trees. Additional series may be proposed as associated soils to Ellijay when more information is collected in these landscapes. National Soil Survey Laboratory data is available for the type location (pedon no. 85P 635). The series include some soils that average more than 40 percent clay in the upper 18 cm of the soil. Such soils classify as Alfisols because the Weatherable mineral content is too high (> 10%) for the Oxisol order.\nHorizon, Percent Clay, Meq/100g Calcium, Meq/100g Magnesium, Percent Base Saturation by Sum of Cations\nA  ; 37 ; 3.1 ; 2.1 ; 25\nBt1; 53 ; 0.2 ; 3.4 ; 23\nBt2; 52 ;\ttr  ;\t2.6 ;\t21\nBC ; 25 ;\ttr  ;\t0.6 ;\t6\nC1 ; 29 ;\t0.4 ;\t20.6;\t70\nC2 ; 26 ;\t0.4 ;\t18.2;\t68\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 4 inches (A horizon)\nKandic horizon - 4 to 34 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nCalcium to magnesium imbalance (Bt1, Bt2, BC, C1, and C2 horizons)\nMLRA = 130; SIR = NC0239\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
