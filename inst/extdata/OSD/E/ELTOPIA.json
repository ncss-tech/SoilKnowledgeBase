These soils are continuously dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches from about May 1 to October 1, unless irrigated.   Depth to the                 duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the duripan ranges from 4 to 10 inches.  The duripan is weakly or moderately cemented and rippable.\nThe Ap1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It has granular or platy structure.\nThe Ap2 horizon is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Value is 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist.  It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bkqm horizon is weakly or moderately cemented and crushes to gravelly or very gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly or very gravelly very fine sandy loam, or gravelly or very gravelly silt loam.  It is cemented with lime and silica.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 3Bk horizon has value is 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist. Texture is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam with rock fragments range from 65 to 75 percent."
