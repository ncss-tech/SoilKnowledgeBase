  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Emery soils are on concave backslopes and side slopes on till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Emery soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess and the underlying silty and loamy pedisediments.  The loess is late-Wisconsinan Peoria loess, and the underlying silty or loamy water-worked sediments are early-Wisconsinan Roxana silt and Cretacious sediments.  Emery soils are underlain at a depth of about 2.1 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) by a strongly weathered paleosol in the Pre-Illinoian till.  They are formed in areas of transition between prairie grass and deciduous forest.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 yo 13.9 degrees C (46 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1143 mm (29 to 45 inches), frost free days ranges from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 feet to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Atterberry and Clarksdale soils are on similar nearby landform positions and average less than 8 percent sand in the series control section.  Blair and El Dara soils are downslope.  They have a thinner loess mantle and average more than 25 percent sand in the control section.  Fishhook and Keller soils are on similar landform positions and contain more than 35 percent clay in the lower one-half of the control section, and formed partly in Sangamon paleosols.  The moderately well drained Downs and Rozetta soils are on similar and more sloping landform positions. Ipava and Keomah soils are on nearby summits and form a biosequence with Emery soils."
