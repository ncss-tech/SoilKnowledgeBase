Chetomba soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Dolbee, Elvira, and Ossian soils formed in silty alluvial sediments on flood plains and river terraces and are subject to flooding. In addition Elvira soils also have high concentrations of iron and manganese oxides in the solum. Chalmers, Maxfield,  and Maxcreek soils have a loess mantle less than 102 cm (40 inches) thick. Dunham soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Garwin and Sable soils contain less sand in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon. Gillett Grove soils contain 25 to 45 percent fine sand and coarser in the lower part of the series control section. Hartsburg, Madelia, Pella, Rushmore, and Wacousta soils typically have thinner sola and carbonates at depths between 31 and 102 cm (12 to 40 inches). Marcus soils have a depth to glacial till of greater than 152 cm (60 inches). Mascoutah soils contain less than 7 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Maxmore soils contain 30 to 70 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Patton soils have sola between 61 to 107 cm (24 to 42 inches) thick and C horizons of stratified silt loam and silty clay loam lacustrine sediments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and the underlying calcareous glacial till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above the mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Andres and moderately well drained Symerton soils formed in loamy outwash and in the underlying silty clay loam glacial till. The somewhat poorly drained Chenoa and moderately well drained Graymont soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying silty clay loam glacial till. The moderately well drained Dana and somewhat poorly drained Raub soils formed in 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm) of loess and the underlying loam till with carbonates deeper than 107 cm (42 inches). The somewhat poorly drained Elliott and moderately well drained Varna soils formed in thin loess and silty clay loam till. The somewhat poorly drained Flanagan soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and the underlying silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam till. The somewhat poorly drained Lisbon and moderately well drained Saybrook soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying silt loam or loam till with carbonates shallower than 107 cm (42 inches). These associated soils are on adjoining higher elevations."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is low. Permeability is moderate in the loess and moderately slow in the glacial till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loess and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s) in the glacial till. In undisturbed areas, the depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is 0.5 foot (15 cm) above the surface to 46 cm (1.5 feet) below the surface, commonly during the late winter and spring, in most years."
