  "STATES": "MT,ND",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ethridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and glaciofluvial deposits from mixed rock sources, and/or in till and lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, drainageways, hills, sedimentary plains, lake plains, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 cm.  Mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
