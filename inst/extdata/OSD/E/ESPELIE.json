  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Espelie series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy lacustrine sediments over clayey glacial till on glacial lake plains or lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper mantle and slow in the underlying clayey material.  These soils have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F, mean annual precipitation is 21 inches.",

The depth to free carbonates ranges from 16 to 40 inches. The upper sediments have up to 10 percent rock fragments and the clayey sediments contain as much as 10 percent rock fragments by volume.  Some pedons have a gravelly layer at the base of the upper sediment.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or loam.  It may have faint or distinct redoximorphic features in the lower part.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.  It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Cg horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bg and 2Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam with more than 35 percent clay.  In some pedons these horizons have thin varves or stratifications of silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Redoximorphic features commonly are distinct or prominent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Bkg horizon.  Some pedons do not have a 2Cg horizon."

They formed in 20 to 40 inches of lacustrine sediments over clayey till or glaciolacustrine sediments.  These materials are of late Wisconsian age.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F. Frost-free days range from 90 to 135.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1250 feet above sea level."

Hilaire and Huot soils are on higher, better drained positions.  The poorly drained Thiefriver and Wyandotte soils are on similar positions, but have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface."
