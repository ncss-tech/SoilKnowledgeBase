  "OVERVIEW": "The Escarlo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in uplifted lacustrine and alluvial deposits on hills with a deposit of ash on the surface.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Escarlo soils have slopes of 4 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is 37 degrees F.",
