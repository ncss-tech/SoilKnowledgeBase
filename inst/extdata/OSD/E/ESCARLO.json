The soils formed in uplifted lacustrine and alluvial deposits with a component of ash in the upper part.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer. Average annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches, and average annual temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
