  "OVERVIEW": "The Elmo series consists of deep, well drained, sodium-affected soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediment.  These soils are on terraces and in drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
