The Alanos soils contain iron and manganese concretions in the upper Bt horizons and have mainly pebble and cobble-size rock fragments.  Crest soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Pinata soils have argillic horizons within 24 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Trampas soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the Bt and C horizons."
