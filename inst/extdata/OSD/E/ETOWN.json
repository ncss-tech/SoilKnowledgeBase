  "OVERVIEW": "The Etown series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Etown soils are on mountain slopes.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
