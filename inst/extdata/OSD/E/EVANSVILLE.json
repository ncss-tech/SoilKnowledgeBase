    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Henshaw, Ragsdole, Uniontown, McGary, Montgomery, Patton, Yeddo and Zipp soils. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Patton, Montgomery, and Ragsdale soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower parts of flats and depressions and the Montgomery soils also have more clay in the subsoil. Zipp soils are on nearly level to depressional areas and contain more clay. The somewhat poorly drained Henshaw, McGary and Yeddo soils, the moderately well drained Uniontown soils are on more sloping terrace positions, are deeper to zones of saturation, and have argillic horizons."

An intermittent apparent high water table is at the surface to 30 centimeters (1 foot) below the surface from December to April in normal years. This soil is subject to periods of frequent, very brief ponding at depths up to 15 cm (0.5 foot) from December to May in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec). Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2.0 inches per hour)."
