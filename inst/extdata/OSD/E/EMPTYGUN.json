  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Azsand, Mesabase, Riverbend, and Varwash series. Azsand soils have MAST of 22 to 25 degrees C. and eolian sands over sandstone parent material. Mesabase soils have a paralithic contact at 50 to 100 centimeters and are derived from sandstone. Riverbend soils do not have secondary silica and are moist in the control section following summer convection storms for 10 to 20 days. Varwash soils have 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalence and alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks influenced by calcareous loess."

Elevations are 140 to 540 meters (about 460 to 1770 feet). The climate is arid with warm, dry winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 125 millimeters (about 2 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 23 to 26 degrees C (about 73 to 79 degrees F), and the frost-free season is 360 to 365 days."
