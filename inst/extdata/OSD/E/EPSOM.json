  "OVERVIEW": "The Epsom series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in colluvial/alluvial sediment over loess and the underlying loamy glacial till.  These soils typically are on flood plains and narrow drainageways in sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 F.",

The depth to the underlying glacial till ranges from 40 to 70 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is silty clay loam, loam, silt loam, or their mucky modifiers.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an Ab horizon or buried Oa horizons.\nThe Bg and 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 to 7 and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a sand or gravelly sand layer above the till that is as much as 10 inches thick.\nThe 3Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  This is considered dense till (paralithic contact) but has numerous fractures that range from .5 to 6 feet apart. Fractures are commonly filled with sandy material."

Epsom soils formed in deposits of colluvial/alluvial sediments over loess and the underlying loamy glacial till.  The sediments are late Wisconsin in age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.
