  "OVERVIEW": "The Evpark series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Evpark soils are on mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, structural benches and ridges. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
