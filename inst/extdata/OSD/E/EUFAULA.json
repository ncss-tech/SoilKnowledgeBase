  "OVERVIEW": "The Eufaula series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on stabilized dunes on reworked stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A) and Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 820 mm (32 in).",

This horizon is dominantly massive, but some pedons have weak subangular blocky structure in the thicker lamellae or in the continuous Bt horizons.\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral"
