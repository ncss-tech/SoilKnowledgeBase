  "OVERVIEW": "The Elbeth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from schist, granite and arkosic deposits.  Elbeth soils are on hills, mountains and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

These soils formed in slope alluvium from arkose deposits, granite, and schist.  In Montana the soils formed in materials weathered from sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 64 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches with about one half falling from April through August. The driest months are December through February.  The frost-free season is about 75 to 110 days."

(Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)\nThe particle-size control section extends from 13 to 33 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nTaxonomic version of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Seventh Edition, 1996.\nThe original concept for this soil is in the Typic Ustic-Frigid zone in MLRA 49 near Colorado Springs, Colorado on hills and ridges that are in the transitional front range between the Rocky Mountains and the plains to the east.  The original parent material source is arkosic deposits, granite and schist.  The depth class has been redefined to very deep.  The Elbeth pedon in Larimer County, Colorado is deep to a paralithic contact, which puts it outside the current concept for Elbeth."
