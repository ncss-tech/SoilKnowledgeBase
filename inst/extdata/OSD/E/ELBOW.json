  "OVERVIEW": "The Elbow series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Elbow soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate above the duripan and very rapid below.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
