Dellahunt and Walkerwells soils are deep and occur lower in the landscape.  Hollebeke and Joberanch soils have a petrogypsic horizon within 20 inches (50 cm) of the surface and occur on similar positions.  Hollomex and Pokorny soils do not have a lithic contact within 20 inches (50 cm) of the surface and occur on similar positions. Niemahr soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a lithic contact and occur lower in the landscape."
