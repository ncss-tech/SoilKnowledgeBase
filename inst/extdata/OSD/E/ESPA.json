  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Espa soils occur on broad ridgetops, upper hillslopes and dissected marine terrace remnants. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6 to 245 meters (15 to 805 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated beach and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 2285 millimeters (35 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 12 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 280 to 325 days."

Surpur soils have an ochric epipedon and are found on broad ridge tops at higher elevations, farther inland. Candymountain soils are course loamy and have a cambic epipedon.  Lepoil soils have an argillic horizon that does not have a clay decrease of 20 percent or more (relative) from the maximum clay content with in 150cm of the mineral soil surface."
