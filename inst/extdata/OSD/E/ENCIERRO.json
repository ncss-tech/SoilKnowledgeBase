  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock are less than 20 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 35 percent and in size from fine gravel to fragments up to 6 inches in length.  The solum is usually leached of lime through the B2t horizon but ranges to slightly calcareous in the lower part of the B2t horizon.  The solum is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The particle-size control section is heavy clay loam, sandy clay or clay.  The clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky to strong fine angular blocky structure.  The B3ca horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The zone of carbonate accumulation is weak, containing less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Apache, Bernal, Cabezon, Kiln, Ledru, and Travessilla series in other families.  Apache soils lack a B2t horizon.  Bernal soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Cabezon soils have the clay fraction in the control section dominated by montmorillonite.  Kiln soils contain 18 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Ledru soils have soil temperatures ranging from 59 to 71 degrees F.  Travessilla soils lack a B2t horizon, contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have an ochric epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Encierro soils are on uplands, hills, and mesa tops and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent.  They formed in materials weathered from sandstone, limestone, and interbedded shales, and loess.  The climate is semiarid.  Elevation is 5,500 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 18 inches.  The frost-free season is 150 to 180 days."

Oro Grande soils are skeletal.  Paymaster soils lack a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
