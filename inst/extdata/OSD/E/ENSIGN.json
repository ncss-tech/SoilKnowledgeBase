  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Some pedons contain limestone flagstones. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume throughout the pedon. Textures throughout the pedon typically are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or the gravelly, flaggy, or cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Where present, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Reaction of the A or Ap horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2. Reaction of the E horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A part of the B/A has textures anc colors similar to those of the A horizon, and the B part has colors and textures similar to those of the Bw horizon. Reaction of the B/A horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or sandy loam. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a thin layer of residuum directly above the limestone bedrock."

Slope gradients commonly are between 0 and 2 percent and range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 32 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from 1 to 5 inches (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 15 inches (Bw horizon).\nThe classification of the Ensign series was changed from Lithic Haplaquepts to Lithic Eutrochrepts in 2/94.  These soils do not have the required 2 chroma colors (Bg horizons) immediately below the ochric epipedon to qualify for an aquic soil moisture regime. Because there is no Aquic Lithic Eutrochrepts subgroup these soils default to Lithic Eutrochrepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record No.: MI0070; MI0477 - COBBLY SURFACE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
