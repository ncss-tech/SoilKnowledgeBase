  "OVERVIEW": "The Eastpark series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed on alluvial fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from ultrabasic rock sources.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
