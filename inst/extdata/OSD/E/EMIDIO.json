Colpien (MLRA 17) and soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks, have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent, and have Bt horizons. Flamen (MLRA 17) soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks, have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent, and are deep to a duripan. Linne soils are moderately deep and formed in material weathered from fairly soft shale and sandstone. Newpark soils (MLRA 14) are on alluvial fans with slopes from 0 to 2 percent.  Pleito soils (MLRA 17 and 18) are on terraces, fan remnants, erosional remnants, and alluvial fans with slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  San Benito soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the A horizons. Colpien, Flamen, Linne, Newpark, Pleito, and San Benito soils do not have a gypsic horizon."

The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 229 to 305 millimeters (9 to 12 inches). The mean annual temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. (59 to 63 degrees F.). Mean July temperature is about 26 degrees C. (79 degrees F.), and mean January temperature is about 6 degrees C. (43 degrees F.).  The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."
