  "OVERVIEW": "The Emidio series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in uplifted alluvium and/or colluvium derived from unconsolidated mixed rock sources. The Emidio soils are on benches on hillslopes. Slope is 15 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 254 millimeters (10 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (62 degrees F.)",

Colpien (MLRA 17) and soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks, have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent, and have Bt horizons. Flamen (MLRA 17) soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks, have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent, and are deep to a duripan. Linne soils are moderately deep and formed in material weathered from fairly soft shale and sandstone. Newpark soils (MLRA 14) are on alluvial fans with slopes from 0 to 2 percent.  Pleito soils (MLRA 17 and 18) are on terraces, fan remnants, erosional remnants, and alluvial fans with slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  San Benito soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the A horizons. Colpien, Flamen, Linne, Newpark, Pleito, and San Benito soils do not have a gypsic horizon."
