  "OVERVIEW": "The Eldorado series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from Pennsylvanian age cherty limestone.  Eldorado soils are on uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1070 mm (42 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C (58 degrees F).",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nEldorado soils are on sideslopes of hills in the uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from cherty limestone.  Many areas have a few inches of soil from chert free limestones or chert free sediments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1090 mm (37 to 43 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C (58 to 62 degrees F).  Frost-free period is 200 to 220 days.  Elevation is 244 meters (800 feet) above mean sea level.  The annual Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 64 to 80."

The fine-loamy, well drained Bates soils are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick over sandstone bedrock, contain little or no chert and occur on interfluves and hillslopes.  The Dennis, Parsons and Maplegrove soils are fine textured and have fewer chert fragments in the control section. The somewhat poorly drained Dennis soils developed in shale parent material and occurs on interfluves and hillslopes.  The somewhat poorly drained Parsons soils lack a mollic epipedon and occur on interfluves, divides, and paleoterraces.  The well drained Maplegrove soils occur on nearly level to level broad uplands.  The fine-silty, well-drained Newtonia soils occur on upland plateaus."

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\n7/19/01 - reformatted to semi tab.  Added lithological discontinuity information\nTaxonomic classification of the type location indicates that the subgroup is Pachic Paleudolls.  The mollic epipedon thickness and subgroup classification needs to be re-evaluated during MLRA updating activities and a new type location established.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
