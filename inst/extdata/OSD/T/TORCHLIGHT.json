  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are calcareous throughout. The organic carbon content of the A horizon ranges from .5 to 1 percent and organic carbon decreases uniformly with depth. Conductivity of the control section ranges from approximately 2 to 8 millimho and exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 25 percent throughout most of the control section. Cation exchange capacity ranges from approximately 60 to 90 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay. The control section is typically heavy silty clay loam or light silty clay with clay ranging from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 20 to 50 percent, and sand from 10 to 40 percent with typically less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent but is typically less than 3 percent and consists mostly of shale chips. The A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, chroma of 1 through 3 and value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist. It is soft to slightly hard. This horizon is strongly to very strongly alkaline (pH 8.8 to 10) and contains 15 to 25 percent exchangeable sodium. The Ccs horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR.  It is strongly to very strongly alkaline (pH 8.8 to 10) and has approximately 2 to 10 percent CaC03 equivalent spread rather uniformly throughout the control section and not concentrated in any particular horizon. This horizon contains 15 to 25 percent exchangeable sodium.  Calcium sulfate accumulation is moderate throughout the control section but is not concentrated in one horizon sufficiently to constitute a gypsic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Torchlight soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans and valley filling sideslopes below exposures of olive and gray highly gypsiferous and very alkaline shale. Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 10 percent. The soils formed in highly alkaline saline and gypsiferous parent sediments derived as alluvial fan sediments from sedimentary rock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, approximately 6 inches of which falls during the months of April through September. The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 68 degrees F."
