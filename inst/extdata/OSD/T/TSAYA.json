Berzatic soils have less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Blacktop soils also have less than 18 percent clay. Cadrina soils have a mean annual soil temperature 47 to 50 degrees F. and a soil moisture control section that is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and fall. Pintwater soils have less than 18 percent clay and significant secondary silica accumulations. Singatse soils have less than 15 percent clay. Sojur soils are 10YR and yellower. Berzatic, Blacktop, Pintwater, Singatse, and Sojur soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tsaya soils are on hillslopes, talus slopes, and structural benches at elevations of 3,180 to 6,400 feet. They are usually on shoulders and backslopes. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium from sedimentary rocks and eolian sediments. The mean annual air temperature is 51 to 57 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. The frost-free period is about 130 to 190 days."
