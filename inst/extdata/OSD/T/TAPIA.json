  "OVERVIEW": "The Tapia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium and eolian material derived from mixed sources. These soils are on piedmont fans and mesas and on interfluves of undulating plains. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in calcareous medium to moderately fine textured material derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks over gravelly very limy deposits. The average annual precipitation ranges from about 10 to 16 inches and the mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F. The precipitation pattern is characterized by a marked summer maximum resulting from thunderstorms. The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days. Elevations range from 5,400 to 7,200 feet."

Harvey soils do not have an argillic horizon and have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the calcic horizon. Pastura soils have a petrocalcic horizon and do not have an argillic horizon. Witt soils contain less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine in the control section and have a calcic horizon at depths greater than 36 inches."
