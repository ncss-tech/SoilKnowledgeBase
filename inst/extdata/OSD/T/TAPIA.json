  "COMPETING SERIES": {

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tapia soils are on summits of interfluves of undulating plains, plains of ancient alluvium, valley side slopes, and mesa tops.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in calcareous medium to moderately fine textured material derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks over gravelly very limy deposits. The average annual precipitation ranges from about 10 to 16 inches and the mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F. The precipitation pattern is characterized by a marked summer maximum resulting from thunderstorms. The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days. Elevations range from 5,400 to 7,200 feet."

Clovis and Scholle do not have a calcic horizons that consist of 20 to 50 percent cemented caliche fragments. Dean soils have carbonatic mineralogy and do not have an argillic horizon. Harvey soils do not have an argillic horizon and have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the calcic horizon. Pastura soils have a petrocalcic horizon and do not have an argillic horizon. Witt soils contain less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine in the control section and have a calcic horizon at depths greater than 36 inches."
