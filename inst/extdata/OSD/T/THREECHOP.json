    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 52 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 3 to 8 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 20 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.  It is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  Clay content averages between 35 and 50 percent in the particle-size control section.  Gravel content is 2 to 10 percent throughout the profile.  Pebbles are soft to firm when moist.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 7/3, 7/4 or 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 5/4, 5/6 or 7.5YR 4/4,4/6.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Organic carbon content ranges from 2 to 5 percent.  The base saturation (sum) ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is variegated 10YR 7/4, 8/3, 8/4; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6, 5/8 or 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 5/6, 8/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6 or 5/8. It is clay loam or clay.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 60 percent. Organic carbon content ranges from 0.9 to 3 percent in the upper 15 inches of the Bt horizon.  Base saturation (sum) is 10 to 50 percent and decreases to less than 35 percent in the lower part of the horizon. Reaction is very strongly through moderately acid.\nThe Cr horizon becomes harder and coarser in texture with increasing depth.  Some pedons have a C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Threechop soils are on rounded ridgetops and upper side-slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 9 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 600 to 1900 feet.  These soils formed in material weathered from soft sandstone and mudstone.  The climate is characterized by  cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A moderate marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range in temperature.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 49 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 220 to 320 days."

Kibesillah, Ornbaun, Yellowhound and Zeni soils dominantly occur on mountain sideslopes.  Kibesillah and Yellowhound soils formed from hard sandstone and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Zeni and Ornbaun soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Zeni soils are moderately deep.  Vandamme soils occur on ridgetops and upper sideslopes of mountains in areas with a stronger marine influence than Threechop soils and have a udic soil moisture regime."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -- 0-8 inches (A).\nArgillic horizon -- 8 to 42 inches, (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5).\nParalithic contact -- Soft sandstone and mudstone occur at 42 inches. Range is 40 to 60 inches.  Material slakes in water and textures to clay loam.  Does not technically qualify for paralithic because of fractures but a Cr is preferred for interpretation reasons.\nMineralogy - placed in mixed mineralogy class.  Lab characterization shows moderate amount of kaolinite by DTA: Bt2 = 38 percent; Bt3 = 35 percent.\nMany areas mapped as Threechop soils were mapped as the Mendocino soil by the California Soil-Vegetation Survey 1947-1950.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL reference sample nos. 821754 - 821759, 837350, 837351\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
