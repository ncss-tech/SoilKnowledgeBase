The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The hue of the solum is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The soil is neutral throughout.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches, except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It is a sandy loam, with 5 to 18 percent estimated clay.  It has 10 to 25 percent subrounded gravels, 0 to 10 percent subrounded to angular cobbles.  Total rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  It has 50 to 80 percent glass and glass coated aggregate.\nThe 2A2 horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 2 to 4 dry.
