The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The hue of the solum is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The soil is neutral throughout.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches, except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It is a sandy loam, with 5 to 18 percent estimated clay.  It has 10 to 25 percent subrounded gravels, 0 to 10 percent subrounded to angular cobbles.  Total rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  It has 50 to 80 percent glass and glass coated aggregate.\nThe 2A2 horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It is loam or gravelly loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Estimated clay content is 10 to 20 percent.\nThe 2Btb horizon has chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is a very cobbly, extremely cobbly or a extremely stony loam with 20 to 27 percent estimated clay.

Blackspar soils lack an O horizon, are dry for 90 to 120 cumulative days and lack the thin pumice ash surface.  Cinderhurst soils are 4 to 10 inches to basalt bedrock.  Wassit soils lack the thin pumice ash surface and an O horizon."

The soils formed in ash over colluvium and residuum weathered from andesite or ash flow tuffs.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
