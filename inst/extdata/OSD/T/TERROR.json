  "OVERVIEW": "The Terror series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Terror soils are found on slopes of 0 to 25 percent on floodplains, terraces, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,000 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
