They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,400 to 2,500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."
