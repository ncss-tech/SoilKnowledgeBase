Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 100 to 130 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Tokiahok soils are associated with Frohling, Kalkaska, Keweenaw, Munising, and Yalmer soils. Frohling soils are coarse-loamy and commonly occur in a complex with Tokiahok. The somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska and well drained Keweenaw soils are common associates on similar landscape positions. These soils formed in sandy deposits and do not have a fragipan. The moderately well drained Munising and Yalmer soils are common associates on lower landscape positions. The Yalmer soils are in the same drainage sequence and the Munising soils are coarse-loamy."
