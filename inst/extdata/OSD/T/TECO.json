  "OVERVIEW": "The Teco series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium derived from sandstone and calcareous shale.  Teco soils are on hills and cuestas and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

They formed in old alluvial deposits containing material derived from sandstone and shale.  Elevations are from 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  The soils are in a semiarid continental climate and receive about 75 percent of their moisture as rain between May and September.  The frost-free season is about typically 140 to 165 days but ranges to 110 in some areas.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 12 to 14 inches."
