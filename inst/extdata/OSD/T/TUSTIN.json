Delton soils  are in the loamy family  have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Metea soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent clay.  Puchyan and Richford soils have argillic horizons with less than 18 percent clay.  Rimer soils are somewhat poorly drained and have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 76 cm (30 inches).  Seward soils are in the loamy family and have redox features and saturation within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

Tustin soils formed in a mantle of sandy eolian or outwash deposits, in  a thin loamy transition layer, and in clayey till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1016 mm (27 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F)."

The moderately well drained Seward and the somewhat poorly drained Rimer soils are on slightly lower positions in the landscape and form a drainage sequence with the Tustin soils. Briggsville, Kewaunee, and Oshkosh soils are geographically associated where the sandy deposit thins to less than 51 cm (20 inches).  Nebago soils are nearby in some places but they do not have an argillic horizon.  In some places where the sandy deposits thicken to more than 152 cm (60 inches), Shawano soils are a nearby associate and are sandy throughout."

    "content": "REMARKS:\n12/04  705 acres correlated as Tustin, sandy substratum in Waupaca Co. have sand below the clay at depths of 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches). New series needed?\n12/04  This series was formerly defined as being formed in sandy deposits and in clayey lacustrine deposits or clayey till. Since about 80 percent or more of the correlated acres are mapped over clayey till, this revision changes the concept of the series to sand over clayey till only. A new series is needed for those acres mapped as sand over clayey lacustrine deposits when they are updated. This includes the acres in Columbia, Green Lake, and Sauk Counties and possibly some of the acres in Calumet-Manitowoc, Waushara, and Winnebago Counties.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); ; argillic horizon - 66 to 117 cm (26 to 46 inches) (2Bt1, 3Bt2, 3Bt3); arenic feature  sandy particle-size from 0 to 66 cm (0 to 26 inches) (Ap, Bw).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
