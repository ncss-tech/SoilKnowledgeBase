  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Timpanogos soils are dry for 60 or more consecutive days in all parts between 7 and 20 inches, in more than 7 out of 10 years. The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons range from 17 to 35 inches. The calcic horizon contains 15 to 45 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and is at depths of less than 43 inches. The water table is at depths of 40 to 60 or more inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of is typically loam or silt loam, but some is marginal to very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam. Organic matter content ranges from 1.5 to 5 percent. The A horizon is usually noncalcareous, in some places it is weakly calcareous where the soil is irrigated.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to loam. Clay films range from thin and patchy to thin and continuous.\nIn some pedons, the C horizon has distinct mottles below depths of 30 inches. The C horizon is of moderately fine, medium, or coarse textured.  Coarse textured layers are at depths below 40 inches."

Ada and Hyrum soils have gravelly clay loam argillic horizons. Bingham soils have gravelly loam argillic horizons that have chroma of 1 or 2, and very gravelly C horizons. Bissell soils are noncalcareous throughout and they have clay loam or sandy clay loam argillic horizons. Kidman and Pleasant View soils lack argillic horizons. Kidman soils, in addition, have fine sandy loam control sections, and Pleasant View soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and gravelly control sections. Mendon soils have mollic epipedons of chroma of less than 2 and more than 20 inches thick. Millard and St.Marys soils have hues of 5YR in the argillic horizon. Millard soils in addition, have gravelly coarse textures at depths of less than 40 inches. Nephi soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons of 5YR hue. Northdale and Scorup soils have hues of 5YR throughout. Parleys soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons containing less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Springmeyer and Tollgate soils have cobbly or gravelly clay loam argillic horizons and lack Ck horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Timpanogos soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are most commonly 0 to 10 percent and range from 0 to 40 percent. These soils have formed in mixed, medium textured like sediments derived commonly from quartzite, limestone, sandstone, gneiss, and granite. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F., the mean summer temperature from 66 to 73 degrees F., and the freeze-free season from 140 to 180 days. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches."

Areas at elevations above existing irrigation projects are used for growing dryland alfalfa and small grains.  Steeper areas are used mostly for growing fruit or as rangeland. The native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, big sagebrush, and oakbrush."
