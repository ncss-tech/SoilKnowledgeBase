  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tavares series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy marine or eolian deposits.  Tavares soils are on hills, ridges and knolls of the lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches).",
