  "REVDATE": "08/2007",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tezuma series consists of well drained, slowly permeable soils that were formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping narrow flood plains of intermittent streams.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 7 inches.",

These soils have formed in mixed alluvium. The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 78 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. Frost-free period is about 150 to 180 days.   Elevation ranges from 4500 to 4800 feet."
