    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tezuma soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping narrow flood plains of intermittent streams. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is semiarid. These soils have formed in mixed alluvium. The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 78 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. Frost-free period is about 150 to 180 days.   Elevation ranges from 4500 to 4800 feet."

Tohona soils have a gypsic horizon and the texture of the control section averages sandy clay loam. Whit soils have a calcic horizon and the texture of the control section averages very fine sandy loam."
