  "OVERVIEW": "The Toqui series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, alluvium and eolian material derived from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Toqui soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
