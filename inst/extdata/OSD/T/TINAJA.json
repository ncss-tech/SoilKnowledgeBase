  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tinaja soils are on hilly, gravelly, convex river terrace remnants, cuestas, and mesas, where elevations range from 5,800 to 7,800 feet.  They formed in gravelly alluvium and colluvium.  Slope is 3 to 75 percent.  The climate is semiarid continental with annual precipitation ranging from 13 to 18 inches with the majority received during the period of July through September.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 100 to 160 days."
