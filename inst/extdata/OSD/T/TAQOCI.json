  "OVERVIEW": "The Taqoci series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone over old alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Taqoci soils are on paleoterraces and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
