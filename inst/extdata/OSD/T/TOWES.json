  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deerton, Garlic, Grand Sable, Lupton, Rhody, and Trout Bay soils. Deerton soils are moderately deep, well drained sandy soils, and are on knolls, ridges and on shoulders of bedrock benches. Garlic soils are very deep, well drained sandy soils on nearby uplands. Grand Sable soils are very deep, well drained, sandy soils that occur on surrounding uplands. Lupton soils are very deep, very poorly drained organic soils, occurring in nearby depressions and drainageways. Rhody soils are moderately deep, poorly drained soils and are in a drainage catena with Towes soils. Trout Bay soils are very poorly drained organic soils over bedrock, and are in nearby depressions and drainageways."
