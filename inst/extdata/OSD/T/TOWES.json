  "OVERVIEW": "The Towes series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty eolian deposits overlying sandy outwash. These soils are on eroded bedrock terraces within glacial drainage channels. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and high in the silty eolian deposit and high and very high in the sandy outwash, and very low in the bedrock. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Grand Sable soils are very deep, well drained, sandy soils that occur on surrounding uplands. Lupton soils are very deep, very poorly drained organic soils, occurring in nearby depressions and drainageways. Rhody soils are moderately deep, poorly drained soils and are in a drainage catena with Towes soils. Trout Bay soils are very poorly drained organic soils over bedrock, and are in nearby depressions and drainageways."
