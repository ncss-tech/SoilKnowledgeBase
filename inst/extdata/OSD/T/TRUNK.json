  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite, rhyolite, quartzite, chert, sandstone, shale, slate and argillite.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,375 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
