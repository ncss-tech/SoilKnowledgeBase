  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Trunk series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, quartzite, chert, limestone, sandstone, shale, slate and argillite.  The Trunk soils are on convex mountain and foothill crests and side slopes, on side slopes of plateaus and on fan remnants with a rock core.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
