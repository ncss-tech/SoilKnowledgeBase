  "OVERVIEW": "The Tripod series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in colluvium from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes are 4 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
