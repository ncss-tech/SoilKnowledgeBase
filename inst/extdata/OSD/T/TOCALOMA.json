    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 55 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The soil is dry throughout from mid-June until sometime in October and is moist the rest of the time. The soil is medium or slightly acid and commonly becomes slightly more acid with increasing depth. Base saturation is 75 to 95 percent throughout the profile. Gravel averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2. Gravel is less than 10 percent.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/3, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2; or 7.5YR 4/4. It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure or it has a slight increase in clay over the A horizon. Gravel averages 35 to 50 percent."

Laki soils are deeper than 60 inches, formed in alluvium with a component of ash, and have MAST of 48 degrees to 51 degrees F. Lovline soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact and have MAST of 47 degrees to 51 degrees F. Saurin soils have a thermic soil temperature. Yaxon soils formed in material with a high component of loess and has, have MAST of 50 degrees to 55 degrees F., and are dry for only 70 to 90 consecutive days."
