  "OVERVIEW": "The Twiss series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks. These soils are on floodplain steps. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
