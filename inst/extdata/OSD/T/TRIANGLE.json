Cracks range from 2 to 8 cm wide at the surface and 1 to 2 cm at depths of 34 inches from May 1 to September 15.  The depth from the surface to the unrelated lower C horizon ranges from 45 to 70 inches.\nThe A + Ag1 horizon is 20 to 37 inches thick.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay content.  Intersecting slickensides and sphenoids are present in all horizons except the A.  Some profiles do not have effervescence in the A and Ag1.  It is 5Y 4/1, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2; 10YR 4/1; or N 3/0.  Moist colors are 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2; 10YR 3/1 or 4/1.  Some pedons have iron manganese shot concretions.  Some areas have a 1/8 inch thick white salt crust.
