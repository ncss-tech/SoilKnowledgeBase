Cracks range from 2 to 8 cm wide at the surface and 1 to 2 cm at depths of 34 inches from May 1 to September 15.  The depth from the surface to the unrelated lower C horizon ranges from 45 to 70 inches.\nThe A + Ag1 horizon is 20 to 37 inches thick.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay content.  Intersecting slickensides and sphenoids are present in all horizons except the A.  Some profiles do not have effervescence in the A and Ag1.  It is 5Y 4/1, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2; 10YR 4/1; or N 3/0.  Moist colors are 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2; 10YR 3/1 or 4/1.  Some pedons have iron manganese shot concretions.  Some areas have a 1/8 inch thick white salt crust.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 1 to 8 mmhos/cm.  ESP ranges from 1 to 27.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe upper C horizon Cgn and Cn1 is 5Y 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 7/4; 10YR 5/2 or 7/3.  Moist colors are 5Y 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/6, 5/8; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4; or 10YR 3/3.  It is heavy clay loam or clay with more than 35 to 60 percent clay content.  It is massive or has weak subangular blocky structure throughout.  It is slightly to violently effervescent.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos/cm. ESP ranges from 15 to 50.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe lower C horizon 2Cn2 is 5Y 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 7/4 or 10YR 7/3.  Moist colors are 5Y 3/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, clay or silty clay with clay content ranging from 22 to 60 percent.  There is 1 to 20 percent weakly cemented durinodes 2 to 20 mm in diameter.  It is slightly to voilently effervescent. Electrical conductivity is greater than 16 mmhos/cm; ESP ranges from 5 to 30.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  This horizon is stratified in some pedons."

Dospalos soils have a cambic horizon, are not ponded for six months and have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Oswald soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to siltstone.  Santanela and Turlock soils have a fine-loamy control section and a natric horizon.  Willows soils have a xeric moisture regime and are not ponded for six months."

The soils have formed in mixed alluvium derived from granitic and sedimentary rocks.  Most of the areas are flat smooth ponds or basins.  Elevations are 70 to 120 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 210 to 280 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS;  These are the competing Dospalos, Santanela, Turlock soils and the Edminster, and Kesterson soils.  Edminster and Kesterson soils are fine-loamy, are not ponded for six momths, and have natric horizons."
