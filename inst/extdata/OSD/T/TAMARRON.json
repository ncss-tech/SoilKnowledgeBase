(Cr layer)\nParticle size control section:  The zone from 9 to 30 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nSeries control section: The zone from 0 to 49 inches (all horizons and upper 10 inches of Cr layer)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nActivity class is presumed based on general trend of other soils in the area.\nADDITIONAL DATA: A similar soil was sampled by NSSL as Tamarron at a different location but lacked the clay increase for an argillic horizon and had many sandy shale fragments that may have been ground up into sand and silt sized particles.  Sample No. S86-CO-067-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
