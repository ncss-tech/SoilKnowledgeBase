  "OVERVIEW": "The Tamarron series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived principally from sandy shale and sandstone.  Tamarron soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

(Cr layer)\nParticle size control section:  The zone from 9 to 30 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nSeries control section: The zone from 0 to 49 inches (all horizons and upper 10 inches of Cr layer)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nActivity class is presumed based on general trend of other soils in the area.\nADDITIONAL DATA: A similar soil was sampled by NSSL as Tamarron at a different location but lacked the clay increase for an argillic horizon and had many sandy shale fragments that may have been ground up into sand and silt sized particles.  Sample No. S86-CO-067-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
