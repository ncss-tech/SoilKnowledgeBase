  "OVERVIEW": "The Timberg series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from siltstone. These soils are on high upland sedimentary plains and foothills. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The control section is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay and 40 to 50 percent silt plus very fine sand. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 44 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Al or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has slightl effervescence. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It has moderate or strong blocky structure and has prismatic structure in some pedons. This horizon is slightly to strongly effervescent; Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R. It has weak to moderate blocky structure and has moderate to strong effervescence with few to common masses of segregated lime. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

They formed in reddish colored, clayey materials weathered from the underlying reddish colored, weakly consolidated shale. Slope is 0 to 45 percent. The climate is cool, moist-semiarid, with long, cold dry winters and moist springs and summers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 19 inches, most of which falls in spring or early summer. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 42 degrees F., mean January temperature from 18 to 25 degrees F., and mean July temperature from 64 to 66 degrees F. The (32 degree F.) growing season is 100 to 135 days."
