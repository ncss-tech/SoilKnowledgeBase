Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for sometime during the year. They flood at some time in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the upper loamy material and high or very high in the lower sandy material. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper loamy material and rapid in the lower sandy material."
