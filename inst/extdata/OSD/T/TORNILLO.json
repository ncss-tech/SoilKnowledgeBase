  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are in broad, nearly level to gently sloping alluvial flats and flood plain steps.  Slopes are plane and are mostly less than 2 percent but range to 3 percent.  These soils formed in stratified Holocene aged fine-loamy alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  Precipitation falls mostly as intense rain during afternoon convectional thunderstorms from June through September.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  Frost free period is 240 to 280 days and elevation is  1,750 to 4,000 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Castolon, Chilicotal, Corazones, Lomapelona, Paisano, Pantera, Strawhouse and Vicente soils. Chilicotal, Corazones, Paisano and Strawhouse soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are on higher, older pediment landforms.  In addition, Paisano and Strawhouse soils have petrocalcic horizons.  Lomapelona, Castolon, amd Vicente soils occur on the Rio Grande floodplain.  Lompelona soils are coarse-loamy.  Vicente soils are coarse-silty.  Pantera soils are sandy-skeletal, and occur on flood plains and arroyo floors.  Pantera soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are on fans and drainageways in similar positions."
