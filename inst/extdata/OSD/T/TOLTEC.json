    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toltec soils are on fan terraces and relict basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in fan alluvium and eolian loams over mixed alluvium.  The average annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches and occurs as thunderstorms from July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
