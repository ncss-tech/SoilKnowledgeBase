  "OVERVIEW": "The Toltec series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium and eolian loams.  Toltec soils are on fan terraces and relict basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
