  "OVERVIEW": "The Thesisters series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Thesisters soils are on south facing back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
