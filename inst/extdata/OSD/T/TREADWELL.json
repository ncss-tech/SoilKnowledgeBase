  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Treadwell series consists of very shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loess over alluvium derived from welded tuff and basalt. The Treadwell soils are on fan remnants and partial ballenas. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
