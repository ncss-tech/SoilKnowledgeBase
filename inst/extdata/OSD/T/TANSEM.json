  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates typically is 14 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness and commonly includes the upper part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or silt loam.  It has weak or moderate grades of prismatic and blocky structure.  Thin clay films or organic stains are on the faces of peds in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It contains 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate diffused and in few to many soft masses.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, rarely 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is massive and is varved or consists of thinly laminated loam, silt, silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam in distinct layers.  Mottling and contrasting colors are in different strata.  Finer or coarser textures are at depths below 40 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amor, Azaar, Coulterg, Diagulch, Max, Quigley, Rottulee, Shambo, Tewfel and Twin Creek series.  Amor soils have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Azaar soils have sandstone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Coulterg and Diagulch soils do not have a cambic horizon and contain less silt in the control section.  Max soils contain coarse fragments and formed in glacial till.  Quigley soils contain 2 to 30 percent by volume coarse fragments and formed in alluvium.  Rottulee soils have shattered limestone bedrock at depths of 20 to 30 inches.  Shambo soils typically do not have calcic horizons, or the laminated silty C horizons and formed in alluvium.  Tewfel soils soft shale bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and do not have a calcic horizon.  Twin Creek soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tansem soils are on level to moderately sloping glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients mainly are 0 to 4 percent but range to as much as 10 percent in a few places.  The soils formed in laminated silty and loamy glacial lake sediments.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from 14 to 17 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Max and Williams soils are on nearby till plains.  Parshall and Tally soils are on nearby lake plains and outwash plains.  Roseglen soils are on nearby nearly level lake plains and are in complex with Tansem soils in places. Makoti, Parshall and Roseglen have a mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  In addition, Makoti soils are fine-silty and Parshall soils are coarse-loamy.  Tally soils are coarse-loamy.  Williams soils have argillic horizons."
