    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days in the upper part in the summer due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.\nDepth to bedrock: 10 to 50 cm to a lithic contact.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 60 percent in the less than 2mm fraction; 40 to 60 percent in the less than 20 mm fraction.\nParticle-size control Section - Clay content: Averages 6 to 14 percent; Rock fragments:  50 to 80 percent, dominantly cobbles and stones with less than 50 percent gravel.\nA horizon\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 2 through 4\nBk or C horizons\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4.\nStructure: Platy or subangular blocky or is massive.\nConsistence: Soft or slightly hard, dry very friable or friable moist.\nTexture: Loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates:  Thin to thick carbonate pendants on rock fragments are common in the lower part of many pedons; Thin, noncemented or weakly cemented coatings cap the bedrock in some pedons, but are not laterally continuous or root-limiting.  Horizons containing more than 5 percent (by volume) identifiable secondary carbonates are less than 15 cm thick and do not qualify as calcic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Theriot soils are on mountains, hills, ridges, and pediments.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,060 to 2,530 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 130 to 170 days."
