The moderately well drained Cardington, Ellsworth, and Glynwood soils formed in till and are on slightly higher topographic positions. Fitchville and Glenford soils formed in silty lacustrine materials; the somewhat poorly drained Fitchville soils are in similar topographic positions, but the moderately well drained Glenford soils are on slightly higher topographic positions. The moderately well drained Lykens soils formed in similar materials but are on higher landscape positions or on slopes adjacent to drainageways."
