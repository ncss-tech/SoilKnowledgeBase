  "OVERVIEW": "The Tiro series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits, a thin layer of loamy water-sorted material, and the underlying loamy till on water modified till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 cm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
