  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuledad series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived dominantly from volcanic rock. Tuledad soils are on summits of plateaus and hills. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
