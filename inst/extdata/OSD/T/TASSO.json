  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed. Rock fragments of chert are mostly gravel size and range between 0 and 35 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4. Some pedons have an E horizon with value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or rarely clay in some subhorizons in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btx horizon or Btx part of the Bt and Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray Mottles of chroma 2 or less are below a depth of 30 inches from the surface. Structure is course platy or medium or coarse prismatic parting to\nsubangular or angular blocky. Texture of the fine earth fraction is mostly silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay but ranges to silt loam and loam. This horizon has brittleness in 40 to 60 percent of the volume. It can be a Btx horizon or a Bt and Btx horizon.\nThe 2Bt or B't[RL2]. horizon has hues of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Mottles are in shades of brown, gray, yellow, or red. The fine earth fraction is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay in the fine-earth fraction."

Cane, Minvale, and Wax soils are on adjacent foot slopes. Dunmore soils are on\nupland slopes, and are in a fine particle-size class and in the mesic temperature regium.. Minvale soils lack [RL4]fragic properties. Cane and Wax soils have a more prominent fragipan."
