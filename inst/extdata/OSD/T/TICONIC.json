The redoximorphic features in this profile were not considered in the current classification of the soil.\nThese soils are not saturated to the surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska, pedon number S91IA-193-002 (http://ssldata.sc.egov.usda.gov/).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
