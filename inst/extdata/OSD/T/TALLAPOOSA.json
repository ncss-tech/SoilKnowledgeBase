  "STATES": "AL,GA,NC,SC,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tallapoosa series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from mica schist.  These soils are on narrow ridges and sideslopes of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 3 to 20 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact (Cr) is 10 to 20 inches and depth to hard bedrock (R) is more than 6 feet.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the solum.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sand, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Clay content is 18 to 30 percent.  The Bt horizon is continuous.  Seams of the Bt horizon extend into the underlying horizons to depths as great as 6 feet and tend to parallel the fracture planes of the bedrock.  Thickness of seams range from 1/2 to 7 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  Saprolite comprises from 65 to 85 percent of the horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is primarily weathered micaceous schist or phyllite but admixtures of gneiss occur.  It is rippable with heavy machinery and can be cut with hand tools with difficulty in most places."
