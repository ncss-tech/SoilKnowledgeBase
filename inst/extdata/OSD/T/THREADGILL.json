  "OVERVIEW": "The Threadgill series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
