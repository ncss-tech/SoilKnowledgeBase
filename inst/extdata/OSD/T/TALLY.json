  "STATES": "MT,ND,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tally series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from eolian deposits, alluvium, or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, till plains, drainageways, hills, sedimentary plains and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
