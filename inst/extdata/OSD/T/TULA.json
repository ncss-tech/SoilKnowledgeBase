  "OVERVIEW": "The Tula series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in modified loamy eolian material and in the underlying loamy till on ground and end moraines.  They are shallow to moderately deep to a fragipan.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual preciptiation is about 31 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
