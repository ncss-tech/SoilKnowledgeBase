  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is 14 to 20 inches deep over sandstone bedrock. The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 59 to 67 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 77 to 82 degrees F. The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 75 to 85 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., unless irrigated. The soils are neutral to mildly alkaline, and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous. The C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 6 through 8, It is dominantly fine sand, but in some pedons is loamy fine sand."

These soils formed in deposits of wind blown sand weathered from sandstone. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  Frost-free period is 190 to 195 days."
