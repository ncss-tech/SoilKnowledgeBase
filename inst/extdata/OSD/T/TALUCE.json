  "OVERVIEW": "The Taluce series consists of well drained soils that are very shallow or shallow to soft sandstone.  They formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  They are on ridges and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  Typically, these soils are calcareous throughout, but some pedons are leached to a depth of as much as 4 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in some or all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27.  It is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a thin Bw horizon.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam and has 10 to 18 percent clay.  Some pedons have slight accumulations of calcium carbonate.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is calcareous sandstone that can be interbedded with mudstone or shale."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Canyon, Epping, Eslendo, Gerest, Picante, Redarrow, Sandoval, Shingle and Tassel series (it is assumed the Picante and Sandoval series are competing pending an update of the classification).  Canyon, Gerst, Sandoval and Shingle soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control sections.  Redarrow soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Epping soils have loam or silt loam textures.  Eslendo and Picante soils are intermittently moist in some parts of the moisture control section from July through September.  In addition, Picante soils also have soil temperatures warmer than 41 degrees F. for 195 to 210 days.  Tassel soils have 10 percent or less clay in the particle size control section."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches with over half of the precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 51 degrees F.  Elevation is 3,500 to 6,500 feet.  The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
