    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Timblin soils are on plateaus and mountain tops at elevations of 2,140 to 2,600 meters.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The soils formed in residuum from basaltic, andesitic, and tuffaceous rock. The climate is cool continental with a mean annual precipitation of 250 to 360 mm. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
