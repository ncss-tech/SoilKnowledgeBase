  "OVERVIEW": "The Tulare series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soil that formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rock. Tulare soils are in basins and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 60 inches or more deep. The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 63 degrees F. The soil is saturated in a reduced state at some time of the year. The A horizon or mollic epipedon is 14 to 25 inches thick. Organic matter is 2 to 3 percent in the surface horizon and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. Calcium carbonate is 15 to 25 percent throughout the profile and is dominantly disseminated although thin layers of decomposed shell fragments occur at random depths. When the soil is dry in late summer, vertical cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 25 to 50 inches and are 2 to 5 inches wide. Pressure faces occur at a depth of 25 to 40 inches. There are no intersecting slickensides.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1, 5/1; 5Y 4/1 or 5/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2; or 5Y 3/1. It has mottles in the lower part that have color of 10YR 3/1, 5/2; 5YR 4/2 or 4/3. This horizon is dominantly clay and less commonly silty clay.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 5/1, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2, 7/1 or 7/2 and moist color of 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2; 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or N 4/0. It has mottles that have color of 2.5Y 4/4; 5Y 2.5/2, 4/2 or 4/3.  This horizon is dominantly clay or silty clay and averages 40 to 60 percent clay."

Dospalos and Gepford soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate. Tinn soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 66 degrees to 71 degrees F. and have and A horizon 25 to 70 inches thick. Iberia soils have mean soil temperature warmer than 66 degrees F., are not calcareous, and have a B2g horizon. Omni soils have a B2g horizon and do not have cracks that are 1 cm. or more wide at a depth of 50 cm., that are at least 30 cm.  long, and that extend upward to the surface. Zaca soils are well drained and have a xeric moisture regime."
