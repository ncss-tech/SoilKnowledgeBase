  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the B and C horizons.  In most pedons, the surface layer contains 5 to 25 percent by volume of angular fossiliferous chert or rounded quartz gravel. Silt content of the control section is less than 30 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Additionally, eroded areas may have hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is typically sandy loam, loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly loamy sand, but ranges to sandy clay loam in eroded areas.\nThe E horizon, where present, has the same range in color and texture as the A horizon.\nSome pedons have a thin BA or BE horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 1OYR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to common.  Texture of the Bt horizon is sandy clay or clay.  Some pedons have a thin subhorizon of sandy clay loam in the upper part of the Bt.  Fine masses of gray or light gray clay range from none to common.\nThe BC horizon, present in most pedons, has the same range in color as the Bt horizon, or it is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, or gray.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam.  Strata of coarser textured material are common.\nThe 2C or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6 or it is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, or gray.  It is commonly stratified in textures of clay, sandy clay, sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Some pedons contain as much as 20 percent ironstone gravel."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Appling, Cecil, Madison, Nankin, and Pacolet series in the same family and the Aragon, Chestatee, Georgeville, Herndon, Hulett, Kolomoki,  Nectar, Neeses, Spotsylvania, and Wedowee series in closely competing families.  All of the competing series are underlain by saprolite or crystalline rock except Aragon, Kolomoki, Nankin, Nectar, and Neeses series.  Aragon soils have more than 15 percent fragments of chert throughout.  Kolomoki soils have dominant hue of 5YR or redder in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Nankin soils have less than 20 percent silt in the control section and have dominant hue redder than 10YR in the Bt2 horizon. Nectar soils have soft sandstone or shale bedrock within a depth of 40 to 60 inches of the surface.  Neeses soils are dense and compact in the lower part of the Bt horizon."

Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 54 inches and mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F, near the type location."

Carnegie and Cowarts soils are on similar positions as the Tumbleton soils.  Carnegie soils have more than 5 percent plinthite and Cowarts soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Dothan, Fuquay, Marlboro, Norfolk, Orangeburg, and Tifton soils are on smoother landscapes than Tumbleton soils.  Dothan, Fuquay, and Tifton soils have more than 5 percent plinthite, and Marlboro, Norfolk, and Orangeburg soils have a thicker Bt horizon.  Red Bay soils are on higher positions and are fine-loamy."
