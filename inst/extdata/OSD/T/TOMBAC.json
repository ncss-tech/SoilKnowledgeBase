  "OVERVIEW": "The Tombac series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived dominantly from Dakota sandstone and shale.  Tombac soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 23 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
