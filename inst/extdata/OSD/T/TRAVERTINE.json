  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Travertine series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from tilted platy siliceous shale, sandstone and siltstone of Mississipan and Ordovician age.  They are on gently sloping to steep shoulders and summits of hills or ridges in the Arbuckle Mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.",

About 10 to 25 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 10 to 20 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is medium or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10 YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 or 4. It is extremely channery silt loam, extremely channery clay loam,extremely channery silty clay loam, or extremely channery loam.  Content of coarse flat fragments make up 60 to 90 percent by volume.  About 10 to 20 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 50 to 70 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon is platy siliceous shale and siltstone that is tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal."
