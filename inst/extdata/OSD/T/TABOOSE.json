  "OVERVIEW": "The Taboose series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian volcanic ash over basalt cinders.  Taboose soils are on vegetated areas of recent lava flows.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12.8 degrees C.",

The soil temperature is above 8.3 degrees C. from about March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below 5 degrees C.; aridic (torric) moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature - 15 to 15.6 degrees C.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 3 to 10 percent; Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent, mainly gravel and stones.  Lithology of fragments are basaltic cinders; Volcanic glass content: 30 to 50 percent in coarse silt thorough fine sand fractions.\nOther features - A surface pavement of stones, cobbles, and gravel covers 35 to 70 percent of the soil surface.  Gravel and cobbles dominate and surface stone cover ranges from 1 to 3 percent.\nA horizon - Dry color: 10YR 5/3 or 6/3.\nMoist color: 10YR 3/3 or 4/3.\nTexture: Very gravelly ashy loamy fine sand or very gravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nRock fragments: 35 to 75 percent, with 1 to 3 percent stones, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 20 to 60 percent gravel.\nOrganic matter content: 0.5 to 1 percent.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.\n2C2 horizon - Dry color: 10YR 4/1, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, or 6/3.\nMoist color: 10YR 3/3, 3/4, or 4/3.\nTexture: Extremely stony ashy loamy fine sand, very stony ashy loamy fine sand, or extremely stony ashy fine sandy loam.\nRock fragments: Averages 35 to 80 percent, with 15 to 25 percent stones, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 40 to 60 percent gravel.\nReaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline."
