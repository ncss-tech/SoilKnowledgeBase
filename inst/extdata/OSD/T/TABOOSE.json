The soil temperature is above 8.3 degrees C. from about March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below 5 degrees C.; aridic (torric) moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature - 15 to 15.6 degrees C.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 3 to 10 percent; Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent, mainly gravel and stones.  Lithology of fragments are basaltic cinders; Volcanic glass content: 30 to 50 percent in coarse silt thorough fine sand fractions.\nOther features - A surface pavement of stones, cobbles, and gravel covers 35 to 70 percent of the soil surface.  Gravel and cobbles dominate and surface stone cover ranges from 1 to 3 percent.\nA horizon - Dry color: 10YR 5/3 or 6/3.\nMoist color: 10YR 3/3 or 4/3.\nTexture: Very gravelly ashy loamy fine sand or very gravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nRock fragments: 35 to 75 percent, with 1 to 3 percent stones, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 20 to 60 percent gravel.\nOrganic matter content: 0.5 to 1 percent.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.\n2C2 horizon - Dry color: 10YR 4/1, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, or 6/3.\nMoist color: 10YR 3/3, 3/4, or 4/3.\nTexture: Extremely stony ashy loamy fine sand, very stony ashy loamy fine sand, or extremely stony ashy fine sandy loam.\nRock fragments: Averages 35 to 80 percent, with 15 to 25 percent stones, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 40 to 60 percent gravel.\nReaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline."
