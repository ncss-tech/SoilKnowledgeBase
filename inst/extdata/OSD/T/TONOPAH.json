    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Caliza (NM), Eastland (NV), Niavi (NV), Redo (AZ), Shelley (AZ) and Zevac (TX) series. Caliza, Redo and Shelley soils have a calcic horizon at depths of 1 to 18 inches. Eastland soils have a calcic horizon at depths of 30 to 40 inches. These soils are not moist for 10 to 20 dayscumulative between July and October. Niavi soils have Bw horizons, have mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 64 degrees and calcium carbonate equivalent of the Bk horizons is 1 to 10 percent. Zevac soils have a calcic horizon at 0 to 5 inches and 35 to 50 percent rack fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tonopah soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,500 to 3,400 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 8 inches; mean annual temperature is 61 to 69 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 300 days."
