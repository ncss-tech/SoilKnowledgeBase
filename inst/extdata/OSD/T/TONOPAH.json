  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonopah series consists of very deep, excessively to well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Tonopah soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

These soils are not moist for 10 to 20 dayscumulative between July and October. Niavi soils have Bw horizons, have mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 64 degrees and calcium carbonate equivalent of the Bk horizons is 1 to 10 percent.
