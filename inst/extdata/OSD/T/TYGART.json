  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 35 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through very strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid through extremely\nacid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. Rock fragments range from 0 to 3 percent in the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe BA horizon and the upper part of the Bt horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 3 through 8. The lower part of the Bt and BC horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 through 7, chroma of 0 to 2. These horizons contain redoximorphic features. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hues of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, values of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. This horizon contains redoximorphic features. It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Some pedons are gravelly below a depth of 50 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Tygart is the only series in its family. Soils in closely related families include the Cavode, Ivory, Newflat, and Wahee series. Cavode soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments of shale and sandstone in the lower part of the solum. Newflat and Wahee soils have thermic temperature regimes. Ivory soils have a frigid temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tygart soils formed in deposits of clayey slackwater alluvium washed from areas of mixed sedimentary lithology. They are found on stream terraces that are not subject to over-bank flooding. Slope gradients are 0 to 8 percent. The climate is humid temperate with average annual precipitation of 35 to 50 inches and average annual temperature of 49 to 57 degrees F."

The well drained Allegheny soils, moderately well drained Monongahela and Zoar soils, poorly and very poorly drained Purdy soils, and somewhat poorly drained Tyler soils which have a fragipan, are on associated terraces. The moderately deep Berks and\nGilpin soils, well drained Upshur soils and shallow Weikert soils are in the nearby uplands. Ernest soils are moderately well drained soils on adjacent colluvial footslopes."

Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 33 inches (Bt and Btg horizons).\n3. Aquic conditions - the zone from 10 to 80 inches is subject to periodic\nsaturation.\n4. Assignment of cation activity exchange class is based on data and classification of a soil in the same catena (Zoar series).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
