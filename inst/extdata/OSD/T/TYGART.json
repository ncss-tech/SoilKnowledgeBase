  "OVERVIEW": "The Tygart series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in slackwater alluvium washed from soils on uplands. These soils are found on stream terraces in the central Appalachian Highlands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. At the type location, mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",

Reaction ranges from moderately acid through very strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid through extremely acid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. Rock fragments range from 0 to 3 percent in the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe BA horizon and the upper part of the Bt horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 3 through 8. The lower part of the Bt and BC horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 through 7, chroma of 0 to 2. These horizons contain redoximorphic features. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hues of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, values of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. This horizon contains redoximorphic features. It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Some pedons are gravelly below a depth of 125 centimeters."

Soils in closely related families include the Cavode, Ivory, Newflat, and Wahee series. Cavode soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments of shale and sandstone in the lower part of the solum. Newflat and Wahee soils have thermic temperature regimes. Ivory soils have a frigid temperature regime."

The moderately deep Berks and Gilpin soils, well drained Upshur soils and shallow Weikert soils are in the nearby uplands. Ernest soils are moderately well drained soils on adjacent colluvial footslopes."
