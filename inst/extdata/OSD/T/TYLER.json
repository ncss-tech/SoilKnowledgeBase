  "OVERVIEW": "The Tyler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium and in a mantle of loess on high Illinoian age terraces and valley fills. Permeability is moderately slow above the fragipan, slow or very slow in the fragipan, and moderately slow in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Captina soils are\nmoderately well drained and typically are on higher topographic positions or on more sloping areas. Ernest soils are on foot slopes and benches on uplands and formed in loamy colluvium.\nPurdy and Tygart soils lack a fragipan. Purdy soils are in lower landscape positions Tygart soils are in similar landscapes."
