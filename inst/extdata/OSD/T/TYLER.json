    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.\nOther series in related families are Brinkerton, Calcutta, Doles, Dubois, Johnsburg, and Robertsville. Calcutta soils are formed in loess underlain by glacial outwash. Johnsburg soils are better drained. Brinkerton, Doles, Dubois, and Robertsville soils have higher base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tyler soils formed in silty alluvium and a mantle of loess on high Illinoian age terraces or dissected valley fill in depressions. Slope gradients range from 0 to\n8 percent. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 36 to 45 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from about 50 to 59 degrees F. Frost free days range from 145 to 181 days, and elevation ranges from 600 to 800 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allegheny, Captina, Ernest, Purdy, and Tygart soils. Allegheny soils are on nearby loamy and gravelly outwash terraces. Captina soils are\nmoderately well drained and typically are on higher topographic positions or on more sloping areas. Ernest soils are on foot slopes and benches on uplands and formed in loamy colluvium.\nPurdy and Tygart soils lack a fragipan. Purdy soils are in lower landscape positions Tygart soils are in similar landscapes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium.  Permeability is moderately slow above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan and moderately slow in the substratum. In undisturbed areas the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 feet from November through May in most years."
