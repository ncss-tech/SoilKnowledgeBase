  "OVERVIEW": "The Thenipel series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and loess derived from siltstone.  Thenipel soils are on footslopes, toeslopes, and fans.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
