  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 48 inches.  The silty mantle ranges from 24 to 48 inches thick.  Depth to hard rock is 6 to 10 feet or more.  The silty mantle has 0 to 3 percent coarse frag- ments, and the 2B horizons have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments including up to 5 percent stones or boulders of igneous rock.  The soil is very strongly or strongly acid above the lithologic discontinuity, unless limed, and strongly acid below.\nThe A horizons have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, vlaues of 4 or 5 and chromas of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam and is slightly firmer than the A horizons.  Bt2 and 2Bt1 horizons have hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 through 8.  The Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons range from heavy silt loam to silty clay loam with inclusions of clay in the 2Bt3 in some pedons.  The 2Bt4 horizons have hues of 10R of 2.5YR, values of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. 2Bt2 horizons are clay or heavy clay loam.\n2BC or 2C horizons have hues of 10R to 5YR values of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are sandy clay, sandy clay loam, or loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  The Chillum, Fletcher, Matapeake, Wernock and Whitley series are in the same family.  The Chillum soils have sola less than 30 inches thick and lack hues of 5YR or redder in the lower part of the solum.  Fletcher soils have sola less than 48 inches thick.  Matapeake soils have sand to loam textures in the lower part of the series control section and formed in deep Coastal Plain sediments.  Wernock soils have sola 30 to 40 inches thick and soft sandstone, siltstone or shale bedrock at 30 to 40 inches.  Whitely soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower throughout and have coarse fragments dominated by shale and sandstone.  The Bucks, Fairfax, Montalto and Neshaminy series are similar soils in related families.  Bucks, Fairfax and Neshaminy soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Montalto soils have a fine particle size-control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Talleyville soils developed in a silty mantle and the underlying residuum from basic igneous rocks, usually gabbro or diabase.  They are nearly level to sloping soils in the uplands of the northern Piedmnont Plateau.  Slopes are smooth and range from 0 to 10 percent, but most are between 2 and 5 percent.  Mean annual temper- ature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."

The Aldino and Butlertown soils have fragipans, Legore soils lack a silty mantle, and Matapex soils are moderately well drained."
