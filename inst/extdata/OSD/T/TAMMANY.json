The Alpowa, Hupp, Middle, and Stricker soils do not have a sand and gravel substratum within 40 inches.  Bonnet soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Copperton, Lakewin,  and Stricker soils have average annual soil temperatures less than 54 degrees F.  Copperton soils have weakly or moderately cemented Bk horizons.  Lakewin soils have 15 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the Bk horizon."

These soils formed in re-worked loamy alluvium from mixed sources over gravelly alluvium from granitic rocks.  Elevations are 750 to 1,200 feet.  The average annual temperature ranges from  51 to 53 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The average frost-free period is from  160 to 190 days."
