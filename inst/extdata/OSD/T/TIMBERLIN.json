  "OVERVIEW": "The Timberlin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in interbedded sandstone and shale residuum or colluvium.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
