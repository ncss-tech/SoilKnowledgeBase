The mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 35 inches. Elevation ranges from 850 to 1200 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowstring, Graycalm, Grayling, Menahga, and Winterfield. The very poorly drained Bowstring soils are in floodplain depressions and swales. The Graycalm, Grayling, and Menahga are sandy soils on the adjoining uplands. The somewhat poorly drained Winterfield soils are on slightly higher landscape positions in floodplains."
