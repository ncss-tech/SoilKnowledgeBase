    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 50 to more than 80 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4, or value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has matrix hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Gray (10YR 7/1) or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions, and yellowish red (5YR 5/6)or brown (10YR 3/3 or 7.5YR 4/4) iron accumulations are common. Iron depletions in shades of gray are few or common in the upper 24 inches of the solum. Texture is fine sandy loam in the upper part of the Bw horizon, and fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the lower part. Thin strata of loamy fine sand through clay loam are in the Bw horizon in many pedons. The average clay content in the 10 to 40 inch control section is 7 to 18 percent.\nThe C horizon has color similar to the Bw horizon, or it is variegated in shades of brown and gray.  Texture ranges from fine sand to clay."

Fontaine soils are on terraces and formed in alluvial sediments eroded from loess and underlying Tertiary materials. Bibb soils have dominantly gray matrix colors throughout the subsoil and have aquic conditions within a depth of 20 inches. Bruin and Keo soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the 10 to 40 inch control section. In addition, Keo soils do not have iron depletions in shades of gray or aquic conditions within a depth of 24 inches. Coushatta soils have more than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section and do not have iron depletions in shades of gray or aquic conditions within a depth of 24 inches. Iuka and Ochlockonee soils do not have a cambic horizon and are more acid. In addition, Ochlockonee soils are well drained. Hamblen, Marietta, Mantachie, and Wehadkee soils have more than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section."
