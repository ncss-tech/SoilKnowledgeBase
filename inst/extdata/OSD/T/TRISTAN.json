Elevations range from 1,524 to 2,286 meters.  Soils at higher elevations occur on south-facing slopes.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
