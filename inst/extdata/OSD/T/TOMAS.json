  "OVERVIEW": "The Tomas series consists of pale brown, well drained, slowly permeable, silty alluvial soils occurring on nearly level, lower portions of alluvial fans in arid and semi-arid regions.  Parent materials are alluvial sediments derived principally from rhyolite but influenced somewhat by andesite, basalt, sandstone and old lacustrine deposits.\nThe Tomas soils are similar to the Genola and the Penoyer soils (Alluvial soils), and are associated with the Antelope Springs and Zane soils (Solonetz): Genola soils are moderately permeable, and have been influenced by alluvium from more strongly calcareous parent rocks, resulting in lime carbonate contents of 5 percent to 30 percent. Penoyer soils are also derived from more calcareous parent materials and have lime contents of 5 percent to 30 percent.  The Antelope Springs soils occur lower on the alluvial fans or in basin-like areas, are moderately fine textured with incipient weak B2 horizons, and are affected by excess sodium and soluble salts.  The Zane soils are reddish brown, moderately fine textured, and have weak B2 horizons.\nThe Tomas soils occur in areas with arid and semi-arid continental climates, with mean annual air temperatures of 48 to 52 degrees F., and summer air temperatures of 65 to 70 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches, 65 percent of which falls when average monthly temperatures are above 32 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 115 to 140 days.  Elevations range from 4,900 to 5,500 feet above sea level.  The Tomas series is inextensive and relatively unimportant agriculturally.",

In places the soils are essentially lime free but in lower-lying areas there may be moderate amounts of lime in the lower parts of the profiles; maximum free carbonates do not exceed about 5 percent.  There may be weak to moderate medium subangular blocky structure in some limy horizons.  The soil material is dominantly silt loam but may be stratified at depths below 24 to 30 inches with very fine sandy loams, fine sandy loams and in places with gravelly sandy loams.  A thin desert pavement exists in some places.  Silt loam is the dominant soil type."
