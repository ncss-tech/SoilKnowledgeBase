In places the soils are essentially lime free but in lower-lying areas there may be moderate amounts of lime in the lower parts of the profiles; maximum free carbonates do not exceed about 5 percent.  There may be weak to moderate medium subangular blocky structure in some limy horizons.  The soil material is dominantly silt loam but may be stratified at depths below 24 to 30 inches with very fine sandy loams, fine sandy loams and in places with gravelly sandy loams.  A thin desert pavement exists in some places.  Silt loam is the dominant soil type."
