  "OVERVIEW": "The Tapicito series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Tapicito soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Potential competitors not yet updated to the current version of Taxonomy are the Colorow (CO), Kornman (CO), Radnik (AZ), and Redbank (WY) series. Cameo soils have hue of 2.5Y and contain up to 25 percent or more coarse fragments in the particle size control section. Clarkelen, Glenberg, and Kornman soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 15 days in June. In addition, Kornman soils have A horizons which have been abnormally enriched by nitrogen and phosphorus. Colorow soils have water tables which fluctuate between 4 and 8 feet, and have oxidized iron colored redox features at depths between 40 and 60 inches. Innacutt soils contain 10 to 25 percent mica in coarse silt to fine sand fractions and 5 to 10 percent coarse fragment in the particle size control section. The Innacutt soil have mean annual soil temperature that range from 52 to 54 degrees. Radnik soils have mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F. Redbank soils have C horizons with hues of 10R to 5YR."
