    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tadpole soils are on plug domes, pressure ridges, lava flow lobes and troughs on shield volcanoes of plains.  Elevations are 2,800 to 3,550 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash over coarse-loamy alluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. Average annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."
