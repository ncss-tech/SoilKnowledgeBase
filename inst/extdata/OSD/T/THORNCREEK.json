  "OVERVIEW": "The Thorncreek series consists of deep, well drained soils on basalt plateaus and mesas.  Thorncreek soils formed in loess.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
