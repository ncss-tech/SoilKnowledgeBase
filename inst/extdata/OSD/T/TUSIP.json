Tusip soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash, pumice, and cinders over residuum and colluvium from sandstone and volcanic ash.  The average annual precipitation is 80 to 100 inches with a large part of it in the form of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."

The spodic horizon is assumed not to meet chemical requirements for a spodic horizon, but is assumed to have silt-sized and larger pellets and cracked coatings on sand grains.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
