  "OVERVIEW": "The Tusip series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, pumice, and cinders overlying residuum and colluvium from weathered sandstone.  Tusip soils are on rounded ridgetops and mountain slopes at elevations of 2,700 to 3,600 feet.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 90 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
