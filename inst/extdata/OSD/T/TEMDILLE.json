  "OVERVIEW": "The Temdille series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium.  Temdille soils are on alluvial fans and bajadas in intermontane basins.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
