  "OVERVIEW": "The Tanner series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a duripan.  They formed in alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces, calderas and structural benches.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
