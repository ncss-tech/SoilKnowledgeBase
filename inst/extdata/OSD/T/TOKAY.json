  "OVERVIEW": "The Tokay series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock sources.  Tokay soils are on low fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

It is predominantly slightly acid to slightly alkaline but some pedons are strongly acid or moderately acid as a result of long term applications of sulfur for disease control.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 6/4; 10YR 6/4, 7/3, 6/3, 5/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4; 10YR 4/4, 4/3.  Clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 7/4, 6/4, 6/3, 7/2, 6/2, 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4.  Clay content is 5 to 15 percent.
