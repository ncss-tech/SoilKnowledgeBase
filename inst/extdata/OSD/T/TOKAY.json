The moisture control section is dry between June and October unless irrigated and moist between mid-November and mid- April.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2; 10YR 5/3, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/3, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2.  Clay content is 10 to 15 percent.  It is predominantly slightly acid to slightly alkaline but some pedons are strongly acid or moderately acid as a result of long term applications of sulfur for disease control.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 6/4; 10YR 6/4, 7/3, 6/3, 5/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4; 10YR 4/4, 4/3.  Clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 7/4, 6/4, 6/3, 7/2, 6/2, 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4.  Clay content is 5 to 15 percent.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tokay soils are on low fan terraces at elevations of 10 to 150 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock sources.  Climate is subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist foggy winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 61 degrees F.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F and average July temperature is 77 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."
