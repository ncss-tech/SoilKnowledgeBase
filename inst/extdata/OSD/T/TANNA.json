  "STATES": "MT,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tanna series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from semiconsolidated shale, mudstone, or siltstone, or in glaciofluvial deposits or alluvium over the bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, strath terraces, escarpments, sedimentary plains, till plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
