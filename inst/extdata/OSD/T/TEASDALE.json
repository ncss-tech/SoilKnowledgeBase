  "OVERVIEW": "The Teasdale series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
