    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the permafrost table ranges from 16 to 26 inches.  Thin layers of organic matter, which consists of partially decomposed mosses, and sedges may occur at any depth.  Thin discontinuous lenses of very fine sand, loam, and fine sand may occur.  Matrix colors are in hues ranging from neutral to 2.5Y, in values of 3 or 4, and in chromas of 0 to 1.  Few to many mottles dark reddish brown and brown commonly occur above the permafrost table."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Napaishak series of the same family, the Batza, Bradway, Chisana, Tanana, and Yarger series of the same subgroup, and the Kuskokwim series.  The Napaishak soils are mostly sandy.  The Batza soils are formed in silty materials and lack buried organic strata.  The Bradway and Tanana soils are high in mica and are nonacid.  The Yarger soils have a fairly thick overburden of volcanic ash.  The Chisana soils have developed in fine silty materials and are nonacid.  The Kuskokwim soils are silty soils with a shallow permafrost table and a histic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tupuknuk soils occupy nearly level floodplains.   The regolith is silty alluvium.  Most areas contain overflow channels, sloughs, and abandoned stream channels.  Flooding, especially during spring thaws, is common.  The climate has characteristics of both maritime and continental conditions.  Winters are long and cold, and summers are short and cool.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 26 to 31 degrees F., and the average precipitation is between 17 to 22 inches."
