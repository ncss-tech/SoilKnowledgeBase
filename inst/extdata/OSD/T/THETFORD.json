  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Thetford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy till or outwash on ground moraines, end moraines, lake plains, outwash plains, terraces, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
