These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 F. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches. Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 14 to 37 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 30 percent sand-size ash, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 30 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 1 to 12 percent. The lower part of the particle-size control section has less than 30 percent volcanic glass, 40 to 70 percent rock fragments, and 1 to 5 percent clay. Depth to sandy-skeletal glacial outwash ranges from 14 to 37 inches. Depth to secondary lime accumulation ranges from 14 to 37 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 through 4 dry. It contains 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. The texture is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy fine sandy loam, or gravelly ashy sandy loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2AB horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 dry. The texture is gravelly loamy sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, or cobbly loamy sand. Rock fragments average 15 to 30 percent by volume. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon texture is a very gravelly sand, extremely gravelly coarse sand, very cobbly coarse sand or extremely cobbly coarse sand. Rock fragments average 40 to 70 percent by volume. Reaction is neutral to strongly alkaline. It has 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

These soils are on kames and terraces and in outwash channels at elevations of 1,200 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

DelRio soils are in outwash channels, swales, depressions, and on side slopes of glaciated plateaus and have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section. Skaha soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments, are sandy-skeletal and do not have a cambic horizon. Strat soils are on similar landscapes as Tubspring soils but are loamy-skeletal. Stubblefield soils are on ground moraines. Touhey soils are on side slopes and toe slopes of till plains. Stubblefield and Touhey soils are both moderately deep to cemented duripan."

The upper profile from the surface to 20 inches has an estimated 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass with 15 to 35 percent pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter. The particle size control section is the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Ap, the A and 2AB, and part of the 2Bk horizons). The weighted average of coarse fragments in the ashy upper control section is 16 percent and the weighted average of the lower sandy-skeletal portion of the control section is 65 percent rock fragments.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial NSSL laboratory data is available for this pedon, 90P333.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
