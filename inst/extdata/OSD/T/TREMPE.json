  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Trempe soils typically have A or Ap-AC-C sequence of horizons.  The pedon typically is strongly acid, but the range includes medium acid or slightly acid in the A or Ap horizons.  There are no coarse fragments in the pedon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR hue; value typically is 3; and chroma is 2 or 3.  It is sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  The AC horizon commonly is dark enough to constitute part of the mollic epipedon, but typically, it contains less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.\nThe C horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR hue; value is 3 through 6; and chroma is 4 through 8.  The 10YR and 7.5YR mainly appear in the lower part of the horizon."

Bellechester, Hawick, and Hononegah soils have free carbonates within a depth of 40 inches.  Finchford, Lasa, Nesius, and Sparta soils have yellower hue in the series control section.  Fruitfield soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and contain more coarse and very coarse sand.  Zumbro soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and yellower hue in the series control section.  Boone and Plainfield soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have yellower hue.  In addition, Boone soils contain less than 5 percent weatherable minerals.  Dunnville soils have finer textures and cambic horizons.  Hubbard soils have yellower hue and frigid soil temperatures.  Salida soils do not have as red a hue and contain pebbles in the series control section."

Sparta soils are nearby in a similar landscape.  Dakota and Meridian soils occupy higher terraces and contain more clay and silt in the upper part of the pedon.  Dunnville and Trempealeau soils have a similar setting and in many places encompass or are adjacent to areas of Trempe soils."
