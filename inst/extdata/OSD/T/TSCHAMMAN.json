  "OVERVIEW": "The Tschamman series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils on basalt plateaus and mesas.  Tschamman soils formed in loess and are underlain by basalt.  Permeability is very slow. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
