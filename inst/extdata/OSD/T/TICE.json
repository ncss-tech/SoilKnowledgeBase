The poorly drained Beaucoup, Darwin, Gorham, and Titus soils are on lower positions on the flood plain. In addition, Darwin and Titus soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and Gorham soils average more than 40 percent sand in the lower part of series control section. Medway and Riley soils are on similar or slightly higher positions on the flood plain nearby and contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section."

Tice soils are rarely flooded or are\ncommonly flooded for very brief to long duration between November and June."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Tice soils have previously been limited to silty clay loam in the particle-size control section. However, Tice soils are currently mapped that contain silt loam in the particle-size control section and contain more than 22 percent clay. There are no other somewhat poorly drained series between Tice and the coarse-silty Coffeen series, so the range of the Tice series, was widened to include silt loam textures.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 14 inches (Ap and A horizons); Cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 19 to 80 inches (Bw and Bg horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size data are on file for several pedons of the Tice soils at the NRCS MLRA Office Region 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
