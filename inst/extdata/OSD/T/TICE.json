    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Tice soils have previously been limited to silty clay loam in the particle-size control section. However, Tice soils are currently mapped that contain silt loam in the particle-size control section and contain more than 22 percent clay. There are no other somewhat poorly drained series between Tice and the coarse-silty Coffeen series, so the range of the Tice series, was widened to include silt loam textures.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 14 inches (Ap and A horizons); Cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 19 to 80 inches (Bw and Bg horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size data are on file for several pedons of the Tice soils at the NRCS MLRA Office Region 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
