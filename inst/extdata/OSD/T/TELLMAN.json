    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches, and depth to the coarse textured substratum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the solum, and are mainly fine angular granite pebbles. In many localities the A1 horizon is absent and an organic mat rests directly on the A2 horizon.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Typically the horizon has weak platy structure that parts to granules, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is typically clay loam, but range in clay from 18 to 35 percent, in silt from 15 to 20 percent, and in sand from 20 to 60 percent with a relatively high percentage of medium and coarse angular granite sand.  The horizon has less volume change on wetting and drying than is typical for its texture.  Dry consistence is extremely hard or very hard, and the horizon has hard-setting semi-cemented properties when dry. Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid with some part of the horizon having base saturation less than 60 percent\nThe IIC horizon ranges from loamy sand to very gravelly sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mathers and Tabernash series. Mathers soils are slightly acid or neutral and have a base saturation of more than 60 percent in the argillic horizon, and contain more than 15 percent fine angular granite gravel in the major part of the solum.  Tabernash soils have a base saturation of more than 60 percent in the argillic horizon, have rock fragments consisting mainly of rounded pebbles and cobbles and have only minor amounts of medium and coarse angular granite sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tellman soils are on gently to steeply sloping alluvial fans, valley side slopes, and stream terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in medium to moderately coarse textured strongly acid parent materials derived from granite overlying beds of coarse granite sand, loamy sand, and gravel within a depth of 40 inches   Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,500 feet.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer.  The average annual temperature is 30 degrees F, and the average summer temperature is 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 50 days."
