  "REVDATE": "08/2005",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Turpela series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in a mantle of glacial outwash or eolian material and underlying fine, dense till. They are on till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid in the upper part and very slow in the underlying till. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

Depth to dense till is 45 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. An Ap horizon ranging from 6 to 9 inches in thickness is in cultivated areas and has value and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have thin or discontinuous Bw or Eg horizons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. The upper part is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam in some pedons.

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days.

The moderately well drained Majestic and somewhat poorly drained Mooseline soils are members of a hydrosequence with Turpela soils. The moderately well drained Hibbing, somewhat poorly drained Buhl, poorly drained McQuade, and very poorly drained Fayal soils form a hydrosequence and do not have a coarse-textured mantle. The very poorly drained Daisybay and Dora soils are on broad flats and in depressions and formed in organic materials over till. The very poorly drained Rifle soils and are in depressions and formed in organic materials."
