  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The depth to carbonates is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragment content, by volume, ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the mantle and from 1 to 8 percent in the underlying till. A thin lag line with as much as 30 percent rock fragments is at the contact of the two sediments in some pedons. Depth to dense till is 45 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. An Ap horizon ranging from 6 to 9 inches in thickness is in cultivated areas and has value and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have thin or discontinuous Bw or Eg horizons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. The upper part is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam in some pedons. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 to 5. Texture is clay or clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is clay or clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Turpela soils are on linear or slightly concave surfaces of till plains and moraines. They formed in a 20 to 40 inch mantle of sandy glacial outwash or eolian sediments and underlying fine, dense glacial till deposited by the St.Louis sublobe of late Wisconsin age. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1600 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buhl, Daisybay, Dora, Fayal, Hibbing, Majestic, McQuade, Mooseline, and Rifle soils. The moderately well drained Majestic and somewhat poorly drained Mooseline soils are members of a hydrosequence with Turpela soils. The moderately well drained Hibbing, somewhat poorly drained Buhl, poorly drained McQuade, and very poorly drained Fayal soils form a hydrosequence and do not have a coarse-textured mantle. The very poorly drained Daisybay and Dora soils are on broad flats and in depressions and formed in organic materials over till. The very poorly drained Rifle soils and are in depressions and formed in organic materials."
