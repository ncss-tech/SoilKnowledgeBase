  "STATES": "KY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Totz series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountains.  Permeability is rapid.  These soils formed in sandy residuum.  Slopes range from 20 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
