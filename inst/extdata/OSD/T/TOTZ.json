  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Totz soils are on mountains and commonly occur near areas of rock outcrop.  Slopes range from 20 to 55 percent.  These soils formed in sandy residuum from Mississipian and lower Pennsylvanian clastics.  Elevation ranges from about 600 to 3,500 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 55 inches."
