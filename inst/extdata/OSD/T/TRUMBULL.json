  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in).  Rock fragments are dominantly gravel but cobbles and boulders are in some pedons.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 2 to 10 percent in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons, extremely acid to neutral in the upper part of the B horizon, and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon.  Reaction of the C horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and is calcareous in some or all parts.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. In wooded areas a 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inch) thick A horizon is present with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to  2. Where present, an E horizon 5 to 23 cm (2 to 9 in) thick, underlies A horizons and some Ap horizons.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The A and E horizons are silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe B horizon, to a depth of 75 cm (30 inches), has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2 with common to many concentrations with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Below 75 cm (30 inches) the range also includes chroma of 3 or 4.  Surfaces of peds have the same range of hue as the matrix, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is dominantly silty clay or clay and the average clay content of the control section is between 35 and 60 percent.  Some subhorizons are silty clay loam, clay loam or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Condit series. Condit soils are very poorly drained.\nThe Canadice, Hoytville, Latty, Lorain, Mahoning, Miner, Toledo, and Wetzel series are in related families.  Canadice soils essentially lack coarse fragments.  Wetzel soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper part of the B horizon.  Hoytville, Lorain, and Miner soils have thick, dark surface horizons.  Latty and Toledo soils lack argillic horizons.  Mahoning soils have a subhorizon within 75 cm (30 in) that has matrix colors with chroma of more than 2. Wetzel soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part of the B horizon and have endosaturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trumbull soils are on level to gently sloping and depressional portions of till plains.  Slopes are dominantly less than 4 percent but range to 6 percent.  The soils developed in low-lime glacial till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in). The mean annual temperature ranges from about 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F)."

Other associated soils are the poorly drained Sebring soils on silty lacustrine deposits and poorly drained Canadice soils on clayey lacustrine deposits."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the subsoil and low or moderately low in the substratum. Depth to the top of a perched and/or apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 ft.) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 ft.) below the surface from November to May in most years.  Frequent brief ponding occurs during periods of heavy rainfall and snowmelt."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of the Trumbull soils have been cleared and cultivated.  Many areas of Trumbull soils are used for pasture or woodland and are no longer cultivated.  Many areas near the cities are in non-agricultural uses.  The dominant tree species are elm, soft maple, pin oak, and ash.  Cultivated areas are used for corn, meadow, and hay."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Trumbull series was classified as Low-Humic Gley soils in the 1938 classification system. Lab data for the Trumbull series indicates the clay content of the control section generally ranges from 35 to 40 percent in most pedons, thus making the previously listed separation from the Condit series invalid. This series separation needs to be evaluated at some point in the future. On 1/22/2014, the original Trumbull typical pedon site was visited to confirm the presence of high chroma concentrations and water table as noted in the description above.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in) (Ap, Bg).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 36 to 112 cm (14 to 44 in) (Btg1, Btg2).\n3. Aquic conditions - the zone from 0 to 152 cm (0 to 60 in) with intermittent perching.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for the Trumbull series include profiles LR-S4, MH-20, and MH-42.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
