  "OVERVIEW": "The Taney series consists of moderately deep to fragipan, moderately well drained soils that formed mainly in loess or reworked loess with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Taney soils are on dissected hills and hills on basalt plains, plateaus and structural benches. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and low through the fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about  51 centimeters and the average annual temperature is about  6.1 degrees C.",
