The soils formed in deep loess or reworked loess with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Elevation is typically 700 to 1220 meters but may range down to (366 meters) on north-facing slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 610 to 940 millimeters, including 1.2 to 1.5 meters of snow.  The average annual temperature is 4.4 to 7.7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 80 to 130 days."
