  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tebbs soils are on low lying alluvial fans and valley plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from basic and intermediate extrusive igneous rocks, mainly basalt.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and distributed fairly evenly throughout the year with about 55 to 65 percent falling between April and September.  July, August and September are the wettest months, with December and January being the driest.  Elevations are 6,500 to 7,500 feet.  The freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."

    "content": "SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Garfield County (Panguitch Soil Survey Area), Utah, 1984.\nREMARKS\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to 5 inches (Ap horizon).\n..Cambic horizon:  from 5 to 28 inches (Bw horizon), based on the lack of fine stratification and the higher color value (moist) than the Ap horizon.\nThe 04/2012 revision recognizes a cambic horizon in this soil and changes the classification from Ustic Torriorthents to Ustic Haplocambids. The cambic is based on the lack of fine stratification and a color change. Although weakly expressed, a cambic horizon in this soil is consistent with the presumed late-Pleistocene or early-Holocene age of the geomorphic surface.  The 04/2012 revision also restricts the series to ustic aridic only; the previous definition included mountain big sage plant communities that are now believed to be in an aridic-ustic regime. Those plant communities and their corresponding 12 to 14 inch annual precipitation are now excluded from the series.\nIt is assumed the SAR for this soil does not meet the criteria for the Sodic subgroup, despite the strongly alkaline reaction allowed in within the upper 100 cm. This needs further investigation.\nWhen proposed this soil was classified as an Ustic Torrifluvent.  When established at the final correlation of the Panguitch Area, it was judged to lack the irregular decrease in organic matter required for that placement.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
