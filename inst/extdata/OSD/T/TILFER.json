  "REVDATE": "06/2015",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tilfer series consists of moderately deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy and silty alluvial sediments overlying limestone bedrock. These soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
