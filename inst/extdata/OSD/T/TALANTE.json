The Maunabo and Fortuna soils are similar in color and drainage but are finer textured.  The Josefa soils are somewhat poorly drained; they have higher chroma mottles, finer texture and are on slightly higher topographic positions.  The Yabucoa soils are brighter colored and moderately fine textured soils.  The Reilly soils are shallow gravelly soils and are on levees along the streams.  The Vivi soils are deep and well drained and are on higher well drained topographic positions on the level flood plains."
