  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unweathered shale typically is at depths greater than 5 feet.  Typically the soil is calcareous throughout but some pedons are leached to about 10 inches.  The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Gypsum and other salts typically are between depths of 10 and 20 inches.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 inch to 2 inches more wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw and Bss horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They have few accumulation of salts in the lower part of some pedons.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon and has color and texture of the Bw horizon.  It typically has accumulation of gypsum and other salts.\nThe Bssyz horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has common to many accumulations of gypsum and other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is clay but some pedons have strata of silty clay."

Kyle soils have a stronger grade of structure in the surface and do not have salts within depths of 20 inches.  Swanboy soils have visible salts within depths of 10 inches.  Mcnary and Venzuni soils have hues redder than 2.5Y."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent.  Gilgai microrelief is in most areas.  The soil formed in clay alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches."

Kyle and Swanboy soils are on similar landscapes.  Hisle soils are in similar landscape and have a natric horizon.  Lismas soils are on nearby steep landscapes and have shale within 20 inches of the surface.  Pierre, Wasa, and Winler soils are on steeper landscapes above the Twotop soils.  They have bedded shale within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, Wasa soils have salts within 8 inches of the surface."
