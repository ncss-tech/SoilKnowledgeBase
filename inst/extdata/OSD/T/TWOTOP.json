  "OVERVIEW": "The Twotop series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium on colluvial fans, hills, ridges and in upland valleys.  These soils have very slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unweathered shale typically is at depths greater than 5 feet.  Typically the soil is calcareous throughout but some pedons are leached to about 10 inches.  The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Gypsum and other salts typically are between depths of 10 and 20 inches.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 inch to 2 inches more wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw and Bss horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They have few accumulation of salts in the lower part of some pedons.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon and has color and texture of the Bw horizon.  It typically has accumulation of gypsum and other salts.\nThe Bssyz horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has common to many accumulations of gypsum and other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is clay but some pedons have strata of silty clay."
