  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated with water and have a water table near the surface during the winter months and wet periods throughout the year unless they have been artificially drained.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soil is more than 60 inches deep, but rooting depth, other than hydrophytes, is limited by the water table.  Some pedons have layers of muck 1 to 4 inches thick with a cumulative total of less than 16 inches.  The weighted organic carbon content is less than 12 percent in the control section.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay by weighted average.  Below the Ap horizon, reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, through 5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  Redox concentrations are faint to distinct.  Structure is weak or moderate blocky and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe Bg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry.  Redox concentrations are faint to prominent.  Structure is moderate blocky or prismatic.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon is stratified, individual layers range from clay to sand and varies within short distances.  Depth to the 2C horizon is more than 60 inches in some pedons."

Mean January temperature is 38 degrees F; mean July temperature is 64 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 200 days."
