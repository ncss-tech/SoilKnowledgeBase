Combined thickness of the A horizons is 5 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon is loam or fine sandy loam. It is strongly through slightly acid. The A1 horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or brown (10YR 4/3) or (10YR 5/3).

The clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent. Silt content is more than 20 percent. Color of the Bt horizon ranges from strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) to yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) with few to many mottles of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) or gray (10YR 6/1) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6 to 5/8) or red (2.5YR 4/8). It is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe Btx horizon and the Btx parts of the Btx/E horizon has ped interiors of gray (10YR 6/1), brownish gray (10YR 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) with few to many yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and (10YR 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and (7.5YR 5/6), red (2.5YR 4/8), and yellowish red (5YR 4/6 to 5/8) masses of oxidized iron and plinthite segregations. Ped exteriors are gray (10YR 6/1). Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. The E parts of the Btx/E horizon are gray (10YR 6/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam or fine sandy loam.  The E parts occupy up to 30 percent of the volume in some pedons, and horizontal spacing between these intrusions of albic material ranges from 2 to 4 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid. Plinthite in the Bx horizon ranges from 0 to about 5 percent.\nA BCtg or BCg horizon is below a depth of 50 inches in some pedons. It has matrix colors of gray (10YR 6/1) and (7.5YR 5/1), brownish gray (10YR 5/2), brown (7.5YR 5/2), pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) with few to many yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and (10YR 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and (7.5YR 5/6), red (2.5YR 4/8), and yellowish red (5YR 4/6 to 5/8) masses of oxidized iron.

Bernaldo and Elysian soils do not have fragic properties. Cart soils do not have aquic conditions or iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Erno soils do not have aquic conditions or iron depletions with chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon. Longview soils do not have an fragic properties. Splendora soils do not have a 3 percent clay increase below the glossic horizon within a depth of 60 inches, and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Olivier and Tippo soils have less than 15 percent fine, medium or coarse sand in the control section, and have mixed mineralogy."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Thage series was reclassified from an Aquic Fragiudalf to a Fragiaquic Paleudalf in October, 2004 based on studies at the type location site and at typical pedon sites in other survey areas which indicated that structure and root penetration do not meet Fragipan criteria. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a a depth of 6 to below 80 inches (Bt, Btx/E, and Btx horizons).\nFragic properties - the zone from a depth of 32 to 70 inches (Btx/E and Btx horizons); percent brittle peds may exceed 60 percent, however structure and root penetration do not meet fragipan criteria.\nGlossic horizon - the zone from a depth of 32 to 39 inches (Btx/E1  horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Panola County, Texas: TAMU Soil Characterization Lab. NO. S85TX203-003, and Lincoln NSSL No. S80TX203-003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
