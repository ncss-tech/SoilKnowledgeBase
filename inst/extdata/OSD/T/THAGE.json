The clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent. Silt content is more than 20 percent. Color of the Bt horizon ranges from strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) to yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) with few to many mottles of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) or gray (10YR 6/1) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6 to 5/8) or red (2.5YR 4/8).

    "content": "REMARKS: The Thage series was reclassified from an Aquic Fragiudalf to a Fragiaquic Paleudalf in October, 2004 based on studies at the type location site and at typical pedon sites in other survey areas which indicated that structure and root penetration do not meet Fragipan criteria. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a a depth of 6 to below 80 inches (Bt, Btx/E, and Btx horizons).\nFragic properties - the zone from a depth of 32 to 70 inches (Btx/E and Btx horizons); percent brittle peds may exceed 60 percent, however structure and root penetration do not meet fragipan criteria.\nGlossic horizon - the zone from a depth of 32 to 39 inches (Btx/E1  horizon)."
