    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 1 to 3 inches.   The solum is 13 to 25 inches thick.  The glacial till substratum has greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and 30 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid in the solum and moderately or slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe AE, E, or A horizon has moist value of 2 through 5; moist chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe 2Bw horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma from 4 or 6.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent and include 5 to 35 percent subangular gravel and 0 to 10 percent subangular cobble.\nThe 2BC horizon (when present) has moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma from 3 or 4.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 50 percent and include 30 to 45 percent subangular gravel and 5 to 20 percent subangular cobble."

Butchlake soils have presumed warmer summer soil temperatures. Cuberant and Targhee soils have hard bedrock between 20 40 inches from the mineral soil surface. Enentah soils have spodic material in the solum. Garlet soils have calcium carbonate in the solum. Gromes soils have clay loam textures in the profile. Soakpak soils need to be redefined. Storm soils have greater than 15 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the solum."

These soils formed in a thin loess mantle overlying very gravelly glacial till deposits.  The climate is subarctic continental.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches."
