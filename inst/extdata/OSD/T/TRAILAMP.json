  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crispy, Cucamungo, Grandridge, Pinew, and Quopant series.\nCrispy soils are slightly acid or neutral, have paralithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm, have rock fragments that are metamorphic rocks such as schist or gneiss, have paralithic materials of weathered metamorphic rocks in the series control section, and are not intermittently moist due to summer convection storms.  Cucamungo soils are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) of granitic lithology in the particle-size control section and have paralithic materials of weathered granitic rock in the series control section.  Grandridge soils are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) of granitic lithology in the particle-size control section, have paralithic materials of weathered granitic rock in the series control section, and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer due to convection storms.  Pinew soils are slightly acid or neutral, have paralithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm, have paralithic materials of weathered volcanic rocks in the series control section, and are not intermittently moist due to summer convection storms.  Quopant soils have 2C horizons below the argillic horizon and have paralithic materials that are weathered ash-flow tuff in the series control section."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone, shale, and sandstone.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,075 to 2,595 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Logring soils are calcareous throughout, have carbonatic mineralogy, an aridic (torric) moisture regime, and a mesic temperature regime.  Sylvaniam soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic and calcic horizons, and carbonatic mineralogy.  Ubehebe soils have an aridic moisture regime and a mesic temperature regime."
