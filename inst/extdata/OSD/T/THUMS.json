Soils with natural soil at the surface are included in this concept.\nThe argillic horizon can sometimes begin directly under HTM with or without a contrasting particle size.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 2009CA696039\nClassified using the Twelfth Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2014)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
