  "OVERVIEW": "The Thums series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in uplifted alluvium from mixed rock sources and have a thin mantle of human transported material at the surface. Thums soils are on terraces and fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 331 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.",

Soils with natural soil at the surface are included in this concept.\nThe argillic horizon can sometimes begin directly under HTM with or without a contrasting particle size.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 2009CA696039\nClassified using the Twelfth Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2014)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
