Iron and manganese concretions range from none to many in each horizon.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A and Bt horizons and from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the Btg and Cg horizons.  Rock fragments make up less than 5 percent of each horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon less than 7 inches thick with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, and clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a thin BA horizon that is transitional in color and texture to the Bt and A horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Few to many iron concentrations are in shades of brown and olive.   Iron depletions with chroma 2 or less are within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay.\nThe Btg and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral.  Iron concentrations and iron depletions are in shades of brown, olive and gray.  Texture is silty clay or clay."

Capshaw soils do not have chroma 2 or less redox depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and are moderately well drained..  Colbert soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.  Wolftever soils have base saturation of less that 35 percent."
