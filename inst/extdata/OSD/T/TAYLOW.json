  "OVERVIEW": "The Taylow series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum from sandstone or siltstone. Taylow soils are on mountain slopes and hills. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
