  "OVERVIEW": "The Teakean series consists of deep to a fragipan, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess and material from gneiss and schist.  Teakean soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 10 to 50 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to 42 inches and low below this depth.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
