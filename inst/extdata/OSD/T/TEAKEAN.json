    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teakean soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 1,600 to 4,300 feet (488 to 1311 meters).  The slope range is 10 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in loess and material weathered from gneiss and schist rock.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 to 40 inches (635 to 1016 mm) and the frost-free season is about 80 to 125 days."
