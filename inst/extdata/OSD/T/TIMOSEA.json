The mean annual soil temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F from about December 1 to March 1 and is below 41 degrees F from about January 1 to February 1.  The soil between the depths of 12 and 38 inches is dry throughout for 210 to 235 days from about May 1 to December 15.  It is moist throughout for 40 to 60 days from about January 15 to March 15 and is moist in some or all parts for 40 to 60 consecutive days from about March 1 to May 1 when the soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F.  The surface is covered with 15 to 70 percent rock fragments (many do not extend down into the A horizon) with 10 to 50 percent gravel, 2 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 12 percent stones, and 0 to 10 percent boulders.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Electrical conductivity is 0 to 2 dS/m\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  Those colors that are dark either do not have the organic carbon or the thickness to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  It has 15 to 60 percent rock fragments with 5 to 35 percent gravel, 3 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 15 percent stones, and 0 to 20 percent boulders.  The fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or sandy loam averaging 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/6, 7/4; 7.5YR 5/6, or 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; or 7.5YR 4/6.  It has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments with 5 to 45 percent gravel, 10 to 35 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent stones and boulders.  The fine earth fraction is sandy loam or sandy clay loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Major diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon--0 to 11 inches (A, AB).  Values are too high, or the epipedon is not thick enough to be mollic.\n1.1  Organic carbon assumed less than 0.6%\n2.  Argillic horizon--11 to 60 inches (Bt, Btk, BCtk).  Clay increase from 12 percent (AB) to 23 percent (Bt) to 26 percent (Btk) by field estimate and hydrometer.  Clay films are present.\n3.  Thermic soil temperature regime -- assumption based on preliminary SCS soil temperature transect, 55 years local climatic records and BLM data.\n4.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed; no indication otherwise.\n5.  Loamy-skeletal particle-size class -- based on field estimates, hydrometer, and rock fragment content.\n6.  Moisture regime - Aridic\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 2/1997. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
