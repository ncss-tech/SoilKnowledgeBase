    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Major diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon--0 to 11 inches (A, AB).  Values are too high, or the epipedon is not thick enough to be mollic.\n1.1  Organic carbon assumed less than 0.6%\n2.  Argillic horizon--11 to 60 inches (Bt, Btk, BCtk).  Clay increase from 12 percent (AB) to 23 percent (Bt) to 26 percent (Btk) by field estimate and hydrometer.  Clay films are present.\n3.  Thermic soil temperature regime -- assumption based on preliminary SCS soil temperature transect, 55 years local climatic records and BLM data.\n4.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed; no indication otherwise.\n5.  Loamy-skeletal particle-size class -- based on field estimates, hydrometer, and rock fragment content.\n6.  Moisture regime - Aridic\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 2/1997. ET"
