  "REVDATE": "06/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Thunderhead series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary or igneous rock. They are on cuestas, hills, mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 8 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
