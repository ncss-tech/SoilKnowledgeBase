    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for fewer than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 degrees F.  There are 5 to 30 percent partially weathered sandstone and siltstone gravel in the solum.  The soil is 40 to 60 or more inches deep to weathered sandstone or siltstone.  The particle-size control section is loam or sandy loam, and averages less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has a value of 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6, with bright stains or variegated colors in the lower part.  It is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam, and averages 10 to 35 percent partially weathered rock fragments."
