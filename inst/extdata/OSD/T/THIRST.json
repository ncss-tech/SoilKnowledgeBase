  "OVERVIEW": "The Thirst series consists of shallow well drained soils that formed in materials derived from volcanic rock such as andesite or dacite. Thirst soils are on hills and mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 260 millimeters (about 10 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16.5 degrees C. (62 degrees F.).",
