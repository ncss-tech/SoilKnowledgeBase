  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock are 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature just above the bedrock is 60 degrees to 63 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is dry in some or all parts from mid-April or early May until late November or early December and is moist all the rest of the time. Most rock fragments are less than 3/4 inch in diameter and make up to 20 percent of the soil. Fragments are mostly in the lower 1/2 of the soil profile. The soil profile is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and has less than 20 percent clay. It is neutral or slightly acid throughout. The A horizon is light brownish gray to yellowish brown (lOYR 6/2, 6/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4). It averages less than 1 percent organic matter. The B2 horizon is light yellowish brown to yellowish brown (lOYR 6/4, 6/2, 5/3, 5/4). In most pedons it has one unit brighter chroma than the A horizon. This horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure."

Amador and Whiterock soils are strongly acid. Auburn soils have within each pedon soils deeper than 20 inches. Calleguas soils are calcareous throughout. Daulton and Gaviota soils lack cambic horizons. Escondido and Vista soils are more than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Exchequer soils have reddish hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. Hideaway soils are strongly acid and have more than 35 percent rock fragments. Maymen soils have a mean soil temperature below 59 degrees F. Millsholm soils have more than 20 percent clay. Sehorn soils are fine textured. Toomes soils lack a cambic horizon in part of each pedon and contain some vitreous material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Temescal soils are rolling to steep and are in mountainous areas at elevations of 1,000 to 3,500 feet. The soils formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rocks. Rock outcrops occupy up to 45 percent of the surface. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. Average January temperature is 52 degrees F., average July temperature is 75 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. The frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."
