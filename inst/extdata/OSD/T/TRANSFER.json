  "OVERVIEW": "The Transfer series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Transfer soils are on mesas and benches.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments are dominantly pebbles, with some cobbles, and range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon and from 5 to 35 percent in the Bt horizon.  The soil moisture control section is moist in some part more than 70 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture ranges from clay loam, gravelly clay, or gravelly clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline."
