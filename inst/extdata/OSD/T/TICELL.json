  "OVERVIEW": "The Ticell series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or loess deposited over sandstone or residuum.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
