  "REVDATE": "02/2011",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Toze series consists of very deep, well drained soils that were formed in slope alluvium from limestone, shale, dolomite, and sandstone.  These soils are on hillside slopes, alluvial fans and mountain plateaus. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
