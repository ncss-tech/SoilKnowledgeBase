Cueva soils are moderately deep to weakly weathered calcareous sandstone and shale. Erramouspe soils are weathered from felsite, do not have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon, and are moist in May and June. Durango, Fikel, Hosta, Montecito, and Prater soils are very deep. Nogal and Wilmac soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Ortiz soils are deep to a paralithic contact."
