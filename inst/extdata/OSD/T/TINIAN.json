  "OVERVIEW": "The Tinian series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone on dipslopes of cuestas, summits of mesas and knolls. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Cueva soils are moderately deep to weakly weathered calcareous sandstone and shale. Erramouspe soils are weathered from felsite, do not have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon, and are moist in May and June. Durango, Fikel, Hosta, Montecito, and Prater soils are very deep. Nogal and Wilmac soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Ortiz soils are deep to a paralithic contact."
