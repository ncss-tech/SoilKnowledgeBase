  "OVERVIEW": "The Tognoni series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt.  Tognoni soils are on hills and mountain slopes, mesas, plateaus and pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
