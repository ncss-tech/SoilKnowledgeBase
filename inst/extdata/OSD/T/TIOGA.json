  "OVERVIEW": "The Tioga series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium on higher positions in flood plains. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum and moderate to rapid in the underlying material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in individual layers in the solum and consist of pebbles or channers, and range from 0 to 60 percent by volume in individual layers in the substratum and consist of mostly pebbles and channers. The soil ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the solum and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. They range from fine sandy loam to silt loam. They have weak or moderate granular structure and very friable or friable consistence. Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 2 to 5 inches.\nThe B horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. They range from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction, and are allowed to have individual subhorizons of sandy loam or loamy sand. They have weak or moderate, subangular blocky, prismatic, or granular structure and very friable or friable consistence.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. They range from loamy sand to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. They have loose to friable consistence."

Wirt soils have a mean annual temperature range from 52 to 57 degrees F.\nThe Barbour, Basher, Chagrin, Comus, Genesee, Grigsby, Hamlin, Middlebury, Moshannon, Ondawa, Philo, Podunk, and Pope series are similar soils in related families. Barbour, Basher, Comus, Ondawa, Philo, Podunk, and Pope soils have base saturation of less than 60 percent thoughout the upper 30 inches. Chagrin, Genesee, and Moshannon soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Grigsby soils have a mean annual temperature range from 53 to 57 degrees F. Hamlin soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section. Middlebury soils have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 24 inches."

Tioga soils formed in recent alluvium, mainly from areas of sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the growing season ranges from 140 to 200 days."

Chenango, Chili, Bogart, Allard, Unadilla, Valois, and Fitchville soils are on nearby terraces. Mardin, Volusia, Chautauqua, Canfield, Ravenna, Alexandria, and Busti soils are till soils on surrounding hillsides. Hazleton and Westmoreland soils are commonly adjacent in unglaciated areas."
