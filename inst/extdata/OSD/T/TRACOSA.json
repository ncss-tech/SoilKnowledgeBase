    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly classified as a miscellaneous land type, Tidal flat, or were included with the Harris series.  This soil has halic properties as described by J. R. Coover, et al., in SSSA Proceedings, 1975.  The typical pedon site was changed during the update of MLRA 150B to a location with lab data.\nClassification changed from Typic Haplaquents to Sodic Endoaquents 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (Ag horizon)\nSodic subgroup: Salinity from tidal flooding (ESP more than 20)\nPeraquic moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  MLRA soil survey office lab data available on S2019TX1673102.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
