  "REVDATE": "07/2019",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tracosa series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits and storm washover sediments of Holocene age. These soils are on broad tidal flats on low coastal plains and on slightly depressional tidal areas on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 0.5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly classified as a miscellaneous land type, Tidal flat, or were included with the Harris series.  This soil has halic properties as described by J. R. Coover, et al., in SSSA Proceedings, 1975.  The typical pedon site was changed during the update of MLRA 150B to a location with lab data.\nClassification changed from Typic Haplaquents to Sodic Endoaquents 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (Ag horizon)\nSodic subgroup: Salinity from tidal flooding (ESP more than 20)\nPeraquic moisture regime."
