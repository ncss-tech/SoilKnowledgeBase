  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tsebitai soils are on fan terraces below mesas, cuestas, and buttes. Tsebitai soils formed in alluvium derived from Cretaceous siltstone and sandstone.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Fordbutte, Littlehat, and Nataani soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock on adjacent bedrock uplands.  Persayo soils are shallow to soft bedrock. Ravola soils are fine-silty, lack diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains and alluvial fans."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches.  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 26 inches.  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nTsebitai is the common Navajo word for the Ship Rock, and means \"rock with wings\".  It is pronounced Say'-bi-tie.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location was sampled for full characterization by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon S86NM-045-013. Salinity values were determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.  These pedons were also wet sieved to determine percent coarser than very fine sand within the control sections.  Calcium carbonate equivalence was also determined with a field volume calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
