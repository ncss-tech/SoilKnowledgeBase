  "OVERVIEW": "The Tsebitai series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from siltstone and sandstone.  Tsebitai soils are on fan terraces below mesas, cuestas and buttes.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

(A horizon)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 26 inches.  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nTsebitai is the common Navajo word for the Ship Rock, and means \"rock with wings\".  It is pronounced Say'-bi-tie.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location was sampled for full characterization by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon S86NM-045-013. Salinity values were determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.  These pedons were also wet sieved to determine percent coarser than very fine sand within the control sections.  Calcium carbonate equivalence was also determined with a field volume calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
