  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The A1 horizons are characteristically friable, although usually ranging from loam or clay loam to silty clay or clay.  They are dark gray (10YR 4/1) or gray (10YR 5/1) when thoroughly dry and distinctly dark when moist, being very dark gray (10YR 3/1), black (10YR 2/1).  They are noncalcareous and moderately acid to neutral in reaction, the upper parts of the A horizons being more acid than the lower parts.\nThe B1 horizons are frequently slightly calcareous and in places contain white specks of segregated lime.\nThe B2 and lower horizons are characteristically of olive cast being light olive gray (2.5Y 6/2) to gray, (2.5Y 5/1) and pale olive, (5Y 6/3) or grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) in the lower portions.  They are moderately to strongly calcareous, much of the lime being segregated.  Texture of the B2 horizon ranges from clay loam to light silty clay.  Most of the Temple soils are free of excess soluble salts or alkali but spots occur containing slight to moderate accumulations."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: They most resemble the Burchell, Chino, Grimes, Merced, Rossi and Sacramento soils. The Burchell soils are developed in alluvium from dark colored slates and usually have dark grayish brown A1 horizons and grayish brown B and C horizons. The Chino soils have thin A horizons, much lower lime content in the B and C horizons, and frequently are affected by excessive salts and alkali.  The Grimes soils are developed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks and are generally fine textured throughout.  The Merced, Temple and Rossi series often occur in complex association, the Temple soils occupying slightly lower elevations.  The Merced soils have very dark gray strong blocky A1 horizons that are high in organic matter and have very firm B2 horizons.  The Rossi soils are much more calcareous than the Temple soils, are moderately to strongly saline-alkali, and have weakly prismatic B2 horizons.  The Sacramento soils are developed in fine textured mixed alluvium and have noncaclareous sola."

The Temple soils occur at elevations of 25 to 200 feet in an arid to semiarid mesothermal climate having a mean annual precipitation of 5 to 12 inches with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters; an average January temperature of 45 degrees F.; an average July temperature of 80 degrees F. with a mean annual temperature of 63 degrees F. and an average frost free season of about 250 days."
