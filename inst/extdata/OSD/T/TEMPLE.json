  "OVERVIEW": "The Temple series consists of (minimal) Humic Gley soils developed from stratified moderately coarse and moderately fine textured predominantly granitic alluvium.  They occur on nearly level to depressional recently deposited floodplains under moisture living grass and herbaceous vegetation.  Characteristically the Temple soils have dark gray granular medium and moderately fine textured A1 horizons with moderate organic matter contents and mottled light olive gray moderately fine to fine textured B2 horizons.  The A1 horizon is typically noncalcareous but lime content increases with depth to moderate or strong including some lime segregated into nodules.\nThey most resemble the Burchell, Chino, Grimes, Merced, Rossi and Sacramento soils. The Temple series is mapped along the San Joaquin River in central California where it is locally extensive.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The A1 horizons are characteristically friable, although usually ranging from loam or clay loam to silty clay or clay.  They are dark gray (10YR 4/1) or gray (10YR 5/1) when thoroughly dry and distinctly dark when moist, being very dark gray (10YR 3/1), black (10YR 2/1).  They are noncalcareous and moderately acid to neutral in reaction, the upper parts of the A horizons being more acid than the lower parts.\nThe B1 horizons are frequently slightly calcareous and in places contain white specks of segregated lime.\nThe B2 and lower horizons are characteristically of olive cast being light olive gray (2.5Y 6/2) to gray, (2.5Y 5/1) and pale olive, (5Y 6/3) or grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) in the lower portions.  They are moderately to strongly calcareous, much of the lime being segregated.  Texture of the B2 horizon ranges from clay loam to light silty clay.  Most of the Temple soils are free of excess soluble salts or alkali but spots occur containing slight to moderate accumulations."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: They most resemble the Burchell, Chino, Grimes, Merced, Rossi and Sacramento soils. The Burchell soils are developed in alluvium from dark colored slates and usually have dark grayish brown A1 horizons and grayish brown B and C horizons. The Chino soils have thin A horizons, much lower lime content in the B and C horizons, and frequently are affected by excessive salts and alkali.  The Grimes soils are developed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks and are generally fine textured throughout.  The Merced, Temple and Rossi series often occur in complex association, the Temple soils occupying slightly lower elevations.  The Merced soils have very dark gray strong blocky A1 horizons that are high in organic matter and have very firm B2 horizons.  The Rossi soils are much more calcareous than the Temple soils, are moderately to strongly saline-alkali, and have weakly prismatic B2 horizons.  The Sacramento soils are developed in fine textured mixed alluvium and have noncaclareous sola."
