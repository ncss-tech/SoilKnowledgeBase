  "OVERVIEW": "The Teval series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on broad, smooth prairie upland terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",
