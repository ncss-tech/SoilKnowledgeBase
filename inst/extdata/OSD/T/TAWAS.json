  "OVERVIEW": "The Tawas series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that are moderately deep to sandy material. They formed in sapric material 41 to 130 centimeters thick overlying sandy drift. They are in depressions within outwash plains, lake plains, till floored lake plains and moraines. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of these soils is moderately high to high in the organic material and high or very high in the sandy material. Slopes typically range from 0 to 2 percent, but may range to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the sandy mineral layers typically is 51 to 107 centimeters and ranges from 41 to 127 centimeters. The organic layers are dominantly pH 5.5 to 7.8 in 0.01M calcium chloride, but the reaction ranges to 4.5 in some pedons.\nIn some pedons, the upper 5 to 10 centimeters is a mat primarily of live fiber. The surface tier has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3. The organic material is sapric or hemic or both and is primarily from woody material. The hemic materials generally have rubbed fiber content near the low end of the range.\nThe organic material in the subsurface and bottom tiers has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3. Broken faces, rubbed and pressed colors are quite similar, but they may vary one unit in value or chroma or both. These layers are dominated by muck, but thin layers of hemic material totaling less than 25 centimeters in thickness are in some pedons. These layers are massive or have coarse blocky fragments. The part just below depths of 30 centimeters has secondary structure of coarse granular or coarse subangular fragments. The organic material contains little recognizable fiber, but undisturbed pieces retain the original wood tissue structure. The lower part of the organic layer commonly is massive. The layer just above the mineral contact commonly contains more mineral material than the other organic layers. Mineral material in this layer amounts to as much as 50 percent of the volume. A thin Ab horizon is present in some pedons. Some pedons have up to 5 centimeters of limnic material above the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 4. It is sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand or gravelly sand. It ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Carbonates are in some pedons."

Closely related soils include the Carbondale, Cathro, Dawson, Greenwood, Lupton and Rifle series. The Carbondale, Greenwood, Lupton and Rifle soils do not have mineral materials within 130 centimeters. Cathro soils formed in organic material overlying loamy materials. Dawson soils have reaction less than 4.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride in the organic material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tawas soils formed in sapric material 41 to 130 centimeters thick overlying sandy drift. Tawas soils are in depressions within outwash plains, lake plains, till floored lake plains and moraines. The depressions range from about 5 acres to 300 acres in size. Slopes typically are 0 to 2 percent, but may range to 15 percent. Minor deposits above 2 percent are on footslopes as the upland soils break sharply into depressional or flood plain areas. These minor deposits are typically associated with groundwater discharge or seep area. Soils in the nearby uplands are predominantly sands. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 560 to 890 millimeters, the mean annual temperature from 3 to 8 degrees C, and the mean summer temperature is about 18 degrees C."
