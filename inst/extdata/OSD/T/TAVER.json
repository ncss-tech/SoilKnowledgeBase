  "OVERVIEW": "The Taver series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on paleoterraces in river valleys formed in alluvium in the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm (28 in.) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F) at the type location.",
