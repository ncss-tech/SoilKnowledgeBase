  "OVERVIEW": "The Tertoo series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on upper relict terraces of mountain valley floors.  Tertoo soils formed in volcanic ash over alluvium from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
