  "OVERVIEW": "The Thornton series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glaciolustrine sediments derived from talc.  These soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is  about 51 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 55 inches.",
