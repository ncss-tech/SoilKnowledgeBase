The soils formed in loamy alluvium with thin strata of sandy materials of Pleistocene age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 483 to 1700 mm (19 to 67 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 19 degrees C (45 to 66 degrees F).  Frost free period is 185 to 245 days.  Elevation is 152 to 427 meters (500 to 1400 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices is 64 to 76."
