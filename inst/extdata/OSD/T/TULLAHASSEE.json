  "OVERVIEW": "The Tullahassee series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in material weathered from mainly loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 1040 millimeters (41 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
