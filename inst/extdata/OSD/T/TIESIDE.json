  "OVERVIEW": "The Tieside series consists of very shallow and shallow well drained soils that are shallow to bedrock.  They formed in material weathered from interbedded limestone, sandstone, and shale.  Tieside soils are on uplands, structural benches, and strath terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact is 7 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F.   Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 10 to 17 percent.  Rock fragment content in the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 30 percent and is dominantly coarse pebbles with some fine pebbles.  The profile is calcareous throughout with a distinct increase in the Bk horizon.  Carbonate content in the calcic horizon ranges from 30 to 50 percent.  Reaction of the profile is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4 dry and moist; and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 15 percent coarse pebbles.\nThe Bk1 or Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent coarse pebbles. In some pedons the Bk1 is not part of the calcic horizon.\nThe Bk2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 50 percent.  This horizon is a diagnostic calcic.  Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam modified with 10 to 30 percent pebbles.  The Bk horizon subdivision will differ from pedon to pedon."
