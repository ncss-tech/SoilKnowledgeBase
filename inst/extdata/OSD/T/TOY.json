  "OVERVIEW": "The Toy Series consists of deep, imperfectly drained, fine-textured, weak Solonetz of cool desert areas. These soils occur on nearly level deltaic flood plains, and vegetation between barren slick-spots consists of a sparse stand of greasewood, saltgrass and inkweed. Parent material is alluvium derived from mixed rocks including andesite, basa1t, tuff, limestone, and reworked sediments of prehistoric Lake Lahontan. Toy soils have been formed under          imperfect to poorly drained conditions and apparently supported a moderate stand of water-loving plants before they became so highly impregnated with salts. This has given rise to moderate quantities of organic matter in the surface soil and a dark brown to black color.\nToy soils are associated with those of Ryepatch, Humboldt and Sonoma.  They have many characteristics in common with Ryepatch soils but differ in having thinner surface soils and a lower content of organic carbon.  They are also much higher in exchangeable sodium and have many slick-spots where Solonetz structure occurs.\nToy soils occur at elevations of about 4,000 feet in a continental arid climate where the summers are warm and the winters moderately cold. The average annual precipitation is about 4 inches. The average January temperature is 28 degrees, July 77 degrees, and the mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F. The frost-free growing season is 100 to 120 days. Toy series in the lovelock area is not extensive, a total of 240 acres have been mapped.",

    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON: Toy silty clay (cultivated)\nAp--0 to 9 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark brown to black (10YR 2/1.5) when moist; strong coarse subangular blocky in topmost 2 or 3 inches and below this, moderate to strong medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky, plastic; many medium and fine wheatgrass roots organic matter about 4.5 percent; few fine tubular pores; very strorgly calcareous; pH of paste 8.5 and of 1 to 1o dilution 9.3; abrupt smooth lower boundary. 6-15\" thick.\nBw--9 to 32 inches; dark gray (N 4/0) clay, very dark gray (10YR 2/1.5) when moist; moderate prismatic structure that breaks to strong fine subangular and angular aggregates; very hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; many fine wheatgrass roots: organic matter about 1.4 percent; few tubular pores; strongly calcareous; pH of paste 8.4 and of 1 to 10 dilution 9.2; clear smooth lower boundary. 12-24\" thick.\nC1--32 to 54 inches, gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1)  when moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky to angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; common fine plant roots; organic matter about 0.8 percent; few fine tubular pores; strongly calcareous with lime disseminated; pH of paste 8.2 and 1 to 10 dilution 8.8; clear smooth lower boundary. 18-26\" thick.\nC2--54 to 67 inches; gray (N 5/0) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium to fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic;  few fine roots; organic matter about 1.2 percent; few fine tubular pores; slightly calcareous; pH of past 8.0 and of 1 to 10 dilution 8.3.\nRange in Characteristics: The prismatic or columnar structure is strongly developed in spots, but weak or lacking in places.  Organic matter is between 3 and 5 percent in the surface horizon, which ranges from 8 to 17 inches in thickness. Calcium carbonate in the horizons above 40 inches range from about 5 to 15 percent. The carbon nitrogen ratio in the surface horizon ranges from 12 to 15. Buried surface horizons may occur in the substratum.\nDrainage and Permeability: Imperfectly drained. Runoff and permeability are very slow. The water table has fluctuated between 7 and 10 feet below the surface since drainage ditches in this area were completed.  Prior to this, the water table probably stood within 4 feet, or closer, to the surface for a significant portion of the year.\nVegetation: In virgin areas a sparse stand of greasewood, inkweed, saltgrass and bassia are common with more than 90 percent of the surface barren. Much of this soil is being reclaimed. Poor stands of tall wheatgrass have been established in places but many spots are barren.\nUse: Most of the Toy soils are associated with those of Ryepatch. Where drainage ditches have been constructed and the water table lowered to a safe depth, these soils are being irrigated and reclaimed in connection with the farming of adjacent Ryepatch soils. Tall wheatgrass is the principal crop.\nDistribution: Inextensive areas are located near Lovelock, Nevada, in Pershlng County. Other areas may occur in other parts of Nevada, possibly in Paradise Valley along the Little Humboldt River north of Winnemucca.\nType Location: 780 feet east and 370 feet north of apparent 3 1/4 corner, sec. 26, T. 26 N., R. 31 E.\nSeries Proposed: Soil Survey of Lovelock area, Pershing County, Nevada, 1957.\nSource of Name: Southern Pacific Railroad Station about 4 miles southwest of Lovelock, Nevada.\nOSED scanned by NSSQA.  Last revised by state on 3/59.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
