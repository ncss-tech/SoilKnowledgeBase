The soil, from a depth of about 7 inches to 21 inches, is usually moist in some part for 45 or more days from January 1 to April 1.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 90 days from July 1 to September 30 in most years.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/4, 6/3, 7/4 or 2.5Y 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4; 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/4.  Moist values of 3 or less are restricted to the upper 3 inches.  It is loam or heavy loam, with 15 to 25 percent clay modified by 35 to 55 percent rock fragments which may be pebbles, cobbles or stones.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/6, 4/4, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/4, 6/4, or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 3/4, 4/2 or 2.5Y 4/4.
