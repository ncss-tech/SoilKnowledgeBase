  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Twig soils have plane or concave slopes in shallow depressions or drainageways on moraines or in swales between drumlins.  They formed in a mantle of organic material and underlying loamy material and underlying till that becomes very firm with depth.  Slopes range fro m0 to 1 percent. The till is from the Superior Lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 675 mm.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 135.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 350 to 450 meters."

Ahmeek, Brennyville, Milaca, Mora and Ronneby soils are all on higher, better drained landscape positions.  The poorly drained Haybrook and Parent soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.  The very poorly drained Giese soils are in similar positions but do not have an organic surface layer over 20 cm thick."

The saturated hydraulic conductivity is 42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second (6 to 20.0 inches) in the organic material; 4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second (.6 to 2.0 inches per hour) in the next layer and .01 to .42 micrometers per second (.0015 to .06 inches per hour) in the dense till.  Perched seasonal high saturation occurs at the surface in spring and fall in normal years.  Ponding is also common during periods of snowmelt and heavy rains."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  histic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Oa1, Oa2, Oe horizons); aquic moisture regime - based on soil saturation to the surface; cambic horizon - the zone from 66 to 122 cm (2Btg and 2Bt horizons); densic contact at 122 cm (2BCd).  The Bt and 2Bt horizons due not meet the requirement for an argillic horizon.\nThe designation of the 2BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nThis reddish colored parent material often does not reduce to 2 chroma or less in either the matrix or as redox features when saturated.  Studies are ongoing to try and explain this situation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 1108 for results of some laboratory analysis of a representative pedon of this series.  Soil Interpretation Record number is MN0165 (obsolete).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
