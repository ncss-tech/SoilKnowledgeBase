  "OVERVIEW": "The Teaspoon series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from gneiss and granitic rocks.  These soils are on pediments, hogbacks, and mountain slopes and have slopes of 5 to 55 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",

Principal native vegetation is scattered to moderately dense stands of ponderosa pine with an understory of mountain muhly, Arizona fescue, needleandthread, Parry's oatgrass, blue grama, prairie Junegrass, slimstem muhly, and pine dropseed. In some areas the vegetation is pinyon and juniper, with Scribner needlegrass, blue grama, Indian ricegrass, and true mountainmahogany. This pinyon-juniper community is now considered outside the concept of the series."
