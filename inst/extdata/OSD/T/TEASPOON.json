Principal native vegetation is scattered to moderately dense stands of ponderosa pine with an understory of mountain muhly, Arizona fescue, needleandthread, Parry's oatgrass, blue grama, prairie Junegrass, slimstem muhly, and pine dropseed. In some areas the vegetation is pinyon and juniper, with Scribner needlegrass, blue grama, Indian ricegrass, and true mountainmahogany. This pinyon-juniper community is now considered outside the concept of the series."
