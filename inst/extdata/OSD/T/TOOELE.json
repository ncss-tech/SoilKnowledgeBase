  "OVERVIEW": "The Tooele series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, lacustrine sediments and eolian material derived from granite and sedimentary rocks.  Tooele soils are on fan terraces,fan skirts, lake plains and lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than 3/4 of the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The soil moisture regime is Typic Aridic.\nTexture in the particle-size control section is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  The clay content in the particle-size control section is 2 to 18 percent.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 40 percent.  The exchangeable sodium in the particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent.  Coarse fragment content is 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile. Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranges 2 to 8 ds/m.  Structure is platy or subangular blocky.  Consistence is soft to hard, slightly plastic to plastic.\nThe Bw and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand or coarse sand.  Clay content is 2 to 18 percent.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranges 2 to 16 ds/m.  Structure is platy, massive, subangular blocky or single grained.  Consistence is soft to slightly hard or loose, dry very friable or loose, moist.  It is nonsticky to slightly sticky and slightly plastic to plastic.  The Bw horizon when present does not meet the definition of a cambic."

Apron, Fruitland, Jeddito, Jenrid, Kumiva, Piltdown and Shotnick soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the particle-size control section.  Fang, Ganaflan, Geer, and Kumiva soils have volcanic ash and pyroclastic materials in the profile.  Marcou, Moepitz and Trachute soils have hue that is 7.5YR or redder.  Mazuma soils have a Bk horizon with less than 3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Moepitz, Vanderhoff, Wentridge and Worland soils have a lithic or paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.

These soils generally occur on higher fan terraces but when they occur as inclusions they occur either on ridges or along drainages. The Swingler soils have more than 18 percent clay throughout the particle-size control section and occur on lower fan terraces and lake terraces.  The Skumpah soils have natric horizons and are on basin floors.  The Yenrab soils have a sandy particle-size control section and are in areas of vegetated sand dunes."
