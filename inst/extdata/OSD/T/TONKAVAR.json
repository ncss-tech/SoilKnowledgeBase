  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact of weakly cemented sandstone is 60 to 80 inches.  The combined A and E horizons range from 40 to 72 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  A few thin lamellae of fine sandy loam are common in the lower part of most pedons, but is lacking in some pedons.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value 4 to 8 and chroma 4 to 8.  Mottles range from few to many in hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value 4 to 8 and chroma 3 to 8.  The texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Cr horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is weakly to strongly cemented fractured sandstone.  It can be dug with hand auger when moist, but is hard when dry.  Roots are present in fractures only.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kenney, Landman, Latch, Lutterloh, and Pickton soils in the same family, and the similar Bienville, Boy, Catilla, Desan, Gunter, Padina, and Tonkawa soils.  Kenney, Landman, Latch, Lutterloh, and Pickton soils lack a paralithic contact within 80 inches of the soil surface.  Bienville and Tonkawa soils lack continuous argillic horizons within 80 inches.  Boy and Gunter soils contain plinthite and in addition Gunter soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Catilla, Desan and Padina soils occur in regions of less rainfall."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tonkavar soils are on upland ridges and hilltops.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent mainly with convex or plain surfaces.  The soil was formed from beds of weakly cemented sandstone and sand of the Jackson Geologic group.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches, and Thornthwaite PE indices range from 62 to 70."

Arol, Burlewash and Falba soils have fine sandy loam surface layers over clayey argillic horizons and are on lower positions.  Elmina and Gomery soils are on similar positions and have loamy fine sand surface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.   Shiro soils have loamy sand surface layers less than 20 inches thick and are on lower positions."
