  "STATES": "CA,OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tandy series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  They are on low lake terraces adjacent to Goose Lake.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soils are saturated below depth of 20 inches and are moist throughout at depths below 12 inches in the spring and most of the summer.  Depth to the 2A horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper sandy mantle has 0 to 15 percent gravel and up to 30 percent mollusk shell fragments.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline throughout.  The sandy mantle lacks mottles and the dominant matrix chroma is 2 when moist.\nThe Ak horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry, with the dominant chroma being 2.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand and average 5 to 15 percent clay and more than 75 percent sand.\nThe 2A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 12 percent organic matter.\nThe 2C horizon has texture that ranges mainly from silt loam to clay loam, but contains strata of fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand."

They have 0 to 2 percent slopes.  The soils formed in wind and water deposited sandy and loamy sediments overlying silty lacustrine sediments.  The sediments are weathered from tuff, felsite, and basalt.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean July temperature is 65 to 68 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.   The frost-free period is about 50 to 80 days."
