  "OVERVIEW": "The Tapco series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Tapco soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees  F.",
