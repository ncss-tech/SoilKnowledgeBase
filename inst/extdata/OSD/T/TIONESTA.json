Particle size class determined by the weighted averages of the contrasting particle size classes.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile are:\nOchric epipedon- the zone from to soil surface to about 5 inches (A).\nCambic horizon- the zone from 15 to 53 inches (2Bw1, 2Bw2).\nRock fragments, mostly rhyolitic pumice gravel, on the soil surface, range from 40 to 80 percent.\nMineralogy is dominantly allophane/imogolite in the 2Bw1, 2Bw2, and 2Bw3 horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was characterized by UC Davis in 1985.  Sample number is # 1624 unpublished.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
