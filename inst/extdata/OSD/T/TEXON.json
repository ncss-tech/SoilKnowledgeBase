  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 72 to more than 80 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 12 inches thick.  The soil, when dry, has cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide that extend from the surface to a depth of about 24 to 36 inches.  The 10 to 40-inch particle-size control section is silty clay or clay containing 40 to 60 percent total clay.  Silicate clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Linear extensibility ranges from 6 to 10 cm in the upper 100 cm of the pedon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout the pedon.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 30 percent in the upper 40 inches of the solum and from 30 to 75 percent below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Effervesence is slight to strong.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Effervesence is slight to strong.\nThe Bss horizons have a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Distinct or prominent pressure faces and slickensides are in these horizons.  Effervescence is slight to strong.\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 4 and 6. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Effervescence is strong to violent.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma 1 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Effervescence is violent.\nSome pedons are underlain by an R horizon below a depth of 72 inches.  The R horizon is indurated limestone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils include Knippa, Mosheim, Rioconcho, Rowena, and Valera soils.  All of these soils are in more moist climates.  Also, Mosheim soils have limestone bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Knippa and Rowena soils have mixed minerology.  Rioconcho soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have a calcic horizon within 39 inches.  Valera soils have a petrocalcic horizon and hard limestone bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Texon soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains of the Edwards Plateau.  Slopes are usually less than 1 percent, but range up to 3 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous silty and clayey sediments over marl and limestone of the Cretaceous-age Buda Limestone Formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 22 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 210 to 240 days.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 2,700 feet.  The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 24 to 32."

Ector and Tarrant soils are higher on the landscape and are underlain by hard limestone bedrock at a depth of 20 inches or less.  Ozona soils are on the same position and have a petrocalcic horizon layer between 10 and 20 inches.  Noelke and Ozona soils are mapped in a complex with Texon soils in some areas.  Irion and Tobosa soils are in slightly lower, concave positions and are vertisols."
