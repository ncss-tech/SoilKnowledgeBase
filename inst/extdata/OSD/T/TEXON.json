  "OVERVIEW": "The Texon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments overlying marl and limestone of the Cretaceous-age Buda Limestone Formation.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on plain surfaces of the Edwards Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",

Linear extensibility ranges from 6 to 10 cm in the upper 100 cm of the pedon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout the pedon.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 30 percent in the upper 40 inches of the solum and from 30 to 75 percent below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 3.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils include Knippa, Mosheim, Rioconcho, Rowena, and Valera soils.  All of these soils are in more moist climates.  Also, Mosheim soils have limestone bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Knippa and Rowena soils have mixed minerology.  Rioconcho soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have a calcic horizon within 39 inches.  Valera soils have a petrocalcic horizon and hard limestone bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
