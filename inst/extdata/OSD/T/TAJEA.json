Ballard, Chualar, Pinto and Tehachapi soils are deep or very deep and occur on terrace positions.  Bohna soils are deep to bedrock.  Chuloak soils are very deep and occur on alluvial fans.  Franciscan soils have A horizons that have 10 to 20 percent clay and are dry throughout for more than 165 days.  Gilroy soils have hues of 7.5YR and 5YR in the A horizon and are dry throughout for 165 days.  Shimmon and Soper soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact."
