  "OVERVIEW": "The Tramway series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Tramway soils are on hills and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 7 and 19 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages from 20 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 20 percent.  Gravel content is 0 to 15 percent.  Where mollic colors occur, the horizon is not thick enough to meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4, 7/6; 7.5YR 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  It is loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent.  Base saturation (sum) is 40 to 75 percent and is less than 60 percent in the lower part of the Bt.  Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent."
