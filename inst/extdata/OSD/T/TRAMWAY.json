  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact and thickness of the solum is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 7 and 19 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages from 20 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 20 percent.  Gravel content is 0 to 15 percent.  Where mollic colors occur, the horizon is not thick enough to meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4, 7/6; 7.5YR 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  It is loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent.  Base saturation (sum) is 40 to 75 percent and is less than 60 percent in the lower part of the Bt.  Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent."

The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong coastal fog influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 50 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 55 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 290 to 365 days."

Vandamme soils are on ridgetops and upper sideslopes slopes of mountains.  Vandamme soils are clayey, have a base saturation of 5 to 35 percent above the paralithic contact and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact."
