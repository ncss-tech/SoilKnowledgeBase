  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The solum, exclusive of limed surface layers, ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  The C horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.  There are no coarse fragments in the solum and in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value and chroma is 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has 5YR or 2.5YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  The higher value and chroma commonly are in the lower part of the sola.  It is sandy clay loam or loam that averages between 20 and 27 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has 5YR or 2.5YR hue, but in some pedons it has 7.5YR hue. Value is 3 through 5, and chroma is 3 through 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR hue; value is 4 through 6; and chroma is 4 through 8.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.  Some pedons have lamellae 1/4 to 1 inch thick that are sandy loam or loamy sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Dakota, Lorenzo, Nineveh, Volinia, and Warsaw series in the same family and the Hesch, Nickin, Pillot, Sylvester, and Whitehall series in other closely related families.  Dakota and Violinia soils have yellower hue in the B horizons.  Lorenzo, Nineveh, and Warsaw soils contain coarse fragments.  Hesch soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches and are coarse-loamy.  Nickin soils are frigid.  Pillot, Sylvester, Whitehall soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on low steam or terraces.  Slopes are usually plane and have gradients of 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy deposits and in the underlying sandy deposits.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, mean annual precipitation from 28 to 32 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  They are more commonly the Trempe soils and less commonly the Gotham and Sparta soils.  Nearby are the excessively drained, sandy Trempe soils with similar red colors. In a few places, there are the somewhat excessively drained, sandy Gotham soils that have a lighter colored A horizon.  In a few other places there are the excessively drained, sandy Sparta soils that have a mollic epipedon but have yellower hues in their subsoils."
