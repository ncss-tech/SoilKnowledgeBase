  "OVERVIEW": "The Trempealeau series consists of well drained soils moderately deep to loamy sand or sand.  They formed in loamy deposits and in the underlying sandy deposits on low stream terraces.  These soils have moderate permeability in the solum and moderately rapid or rapid in the underlying material.  Slopes range 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual preceipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The solum, exclusive of limed surface layers, ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  The C horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.  There are no coarse fragments in the solum and in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value and chroma is 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has 5YR or 2.5YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  The higher value and chroma commonly are in the lower part of the sola.  It is sandy clay loam or loam that averages between 20 and 27 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has 5YR or 2.5YR hue, but in some pedons it has 7.5YR hue. Value is 3 through 5, and chroma is 3 through 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR hue; value is 4 through 6; and chroma is 4 through 8.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.  Some pedons have lamellae 1/4 to 1 inch thick that are sandy loam or loamy sand."

Dakota and Violinia soils have yellower hue in the B horizons.  Lorenzo, Nineveh, and Warsaw soils contain coarse fragments.  Hesch soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches and are coarse-loamy.  Nickin soils are frigid.  Pillot, Sylvester, Whitehall soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
