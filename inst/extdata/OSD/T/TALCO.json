  "OVERVIEW": "The Talco series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on stream terraces on remmants there of 50 to 200 feet above present streams.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in loamy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene Age.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Mottles in shades of gray or brown range from none to a mottled matrix of these colors.  It is silt loam or loam and reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe E or E/B horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Many pedons are mottled in these colors.  The B part is brown or yellow.

Mean annual precipitation is 42 to 48 inches.  The average summer moisture deficit is 4 or 5 inches; but the annual moisture deficit is plus 4 or 5 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 66 degrees F. and the Thornthwaithe annual P-E indices ranges from 68 to 76."

The Derly soils are in poorly drained, depressional areas subject to ponding.  Bowie, Freestone, and Kullit are loamy soils on slightly higher nearby uplands.  Nahatche soils are on lower elevations of flood plains.  Raino soils are on associated mounds on the same surface.  Woodtell soils have clayey argillic horizons and are on side slopes along drains below or on low hills slightly above Talco soils."
