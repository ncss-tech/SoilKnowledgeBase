Elevations are 290 to 330 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 6 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."
