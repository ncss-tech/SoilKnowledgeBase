Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Rock outcrop and surface boulders are common.  The climate is subhumid with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 740 to 1651 mm and occurs mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 1 to 4 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 30 to 80 days."
