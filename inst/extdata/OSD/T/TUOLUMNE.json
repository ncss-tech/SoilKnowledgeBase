  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuolumne series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, and/or till from granitic rocks. Tuolumne soils are on alluvial fans, mountain slopes, aprons on mountainsides, talus slopes, colluvial aprons, moraines, stream terraces, ancient landslides, avalanche chutes, bedrock benches, bedrock joints, and ephemeral streams. Slope is 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,040 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
