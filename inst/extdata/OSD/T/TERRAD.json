  "OVERVIEW": "The Terrad series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale or in alluvium over shale. These soils are on uplands. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual Precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
