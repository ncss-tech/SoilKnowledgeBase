The control section is mostly volcanic ash. These soils are usually moist between depths of 4 and 12 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The soils contain less than 5 percent coarse fragments. They are neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It has moderate granular or blocky structure.\nThe Bg horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Sandy and gravelly glacial outwash alluvium or glacial till may occur at depths below 40 inches, and thin lenses of these textures may occur within the lower part of the control section."
