  "REVDATE": "10/2001",
  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonata series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on nearly level to depressional areas of till and outwash plains at elevations of 3,500 to 5,500 feet. They formed in volcanic ash. These soils occur in a cold, subhumid climate. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F.; the mean annual precipitation is 30 to 35 inches; and the mean annual frost free period is 80 to 100 days.",

The control section is mostly volcanic ash. These soils are usually moist between depths of 4 and 12 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The soils contain less than 5 percent coarse fragments. They are neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It has moderate granular or blocky structure.\nThe Bg horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Sandy and gravelly glacial outwash alluvium or glacial till may occur at depths below 40 inches, and thin lenses of these textures may occur within the lower part of the control section."
