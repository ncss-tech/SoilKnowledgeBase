They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, schist, and Quaternary loess; over residuum derived from basaltic tuff or granitic sandstone.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,400 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Alire soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on beveled summits of erosional fan remnants.  Encantado soils are sandy-skeletal, contain less calcium carbonate, and occur on shoulders and backslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Nazario soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and occur on narrow beveled summits of erosional fan remnants."
