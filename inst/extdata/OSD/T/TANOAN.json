  "OVERVIEW": "The Tanoan series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and loess, over residuum derived from basaltic tuff or granitic sandstone.  Tanoan soils are on shoulders and footslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
