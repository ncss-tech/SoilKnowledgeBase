  "OVERVIEW": "The Tahoma series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic volcanic rock.  Tahoma soils are on mountain sides and have slopes that range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1016 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
