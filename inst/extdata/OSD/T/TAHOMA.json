Slope gradient range from 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium over residuum from volcanic flow rock, latite, and andesite.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 640 to 1525 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C., mean January temperature is -4 degrees C., and mean July temperature is 15 degrees C.  The average frost-free season is 25 to 90 days."
