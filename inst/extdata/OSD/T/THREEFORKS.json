Barbourville soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 degrees F or more.  Colepoint soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, have formed over metavolcanic and metasedimentary bedrock and typically have high chroma and value in the lower part of the subsoil. Crutchfield soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Cutshin soils have channery or flaggy textures.  Horeb soils are moderately well drained with mottles having chroma of 2 or less at 24 to 36 inches. Meda soils are on fans and have a solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches. Molalla soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, and have hue of 5YR or redder.  Stevenson soils have chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry in the subsoil and substratum and contain 15 to 35 percent soft fragments in the particle-size control section.  Tuckasegee soils have hot moist summers, have formed over granite and/or gneiss and the solum is typically fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam."

(A and BA horizons)\nCambic horizon - from 11 to 49 inches.  (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches.\nBase saturation is assumed to be less than 50 percent in the upper 10 inches.\nThis soil typically has a uniform sand size (fine and very fine sand) with a high mica content (although not high enough to have a micaceous mineralogy family classification).  The soil exhibits weak to moderate dilatency.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
