As a result, the classification was changed from loamy-skeletal, isotic Typic Humicryods to medial-skeletal, amorphic Andic Humicryods. The soils are assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data--pedon number FS62-Ore-045-15 (1-6) by Oregon State University (unpublished)\nType location user site ID--1985OR005001\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
