The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. The upper part of the particle-size control section has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, ammonium-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, P-retention of 90 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water content (air dried) of 20 to 30 percent. Hue is 10YR. The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. Depth to aquic conditions and associated redoximorphic features is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe Ap and A1 horizon has value of 1 or 2 moist, 2 through 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry. Texture is medial silt loam with 18 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel. Organic carbon content is 6 to 15 percent.\nThe A2 horizon or AB horizon (when present), has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 3 moist and dry. Texture is medial silt loam or medial silty clay loam with 25 to 30 percent clay by field estimate. It has 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel.\nThe 2Bw horizon or 2BC horizon (when present), has value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.

Chitwood, Hebo, and Knappa soils qualify for an andic subgroup and are on slightly higher terrace remnants. In addition, Chitwood and Hebo soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and Knappa soils do not have aquic conditions with redox features. Ginger soils are on linear to concave areas of stream terraces, have redox depletions at depths of 12 to 20 inches, and have a particle-size family class of medial over clayey. Quillamook soils are on linear to convex areas of stream terraces, have a medial particle-size family class, and do not have aquic conditions with redox features. Wolfer soils are on convex areas of stream terraces, and have a particle-size family class of medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
