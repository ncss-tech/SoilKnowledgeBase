    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Talved soils are on talus slopes on scoured glacial-valley walls. Slopes are 20 to 65 percent. These soils formed in colluvium weathered from volcanic rock that is breaking loose from glacially scoured bedrock outcrops. These talus slopes and scoured bedrock outcrops are in some areas aligned with the Hat Creek Rim. Elevation is 5981 to 7602 feet (1823 to 2317 m). Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches (635 to 1143 mm). The mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F (5.5 to 7 degrees C). Frost free season is 60 to 85 days."
