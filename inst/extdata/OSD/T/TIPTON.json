  "OVERVIEW": "The Tipton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous loamy and silty alluvium of late Pleistocene or Holocene age on nearly level to moderately sloping upland terraces in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in) and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
