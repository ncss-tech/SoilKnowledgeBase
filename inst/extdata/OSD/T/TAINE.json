  "OVERVIEW": "The Taine series consists of shallow and very shallow well drained soils that formed in alluvium from basalt.  Taine soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 12 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
