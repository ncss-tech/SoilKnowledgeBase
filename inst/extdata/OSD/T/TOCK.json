  "OVERVIEW": "The Tock series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a hardpan that formed in old alluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
