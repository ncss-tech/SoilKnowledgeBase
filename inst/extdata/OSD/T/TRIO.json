Cobbles and stones range from 0 to 5 percent above the duripan and 0 to 8 percent between the pan and bedrock.\nThe Ap and A1 horizons have chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe B horizon has chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a thin moderately or strongly calcareous Cca horizon above the duripan.  When this horizon is present, it has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Ccasim horizon is weakly or strongly cemented.\nThe Cca horizon below the duripan is absent in some pedons.  When this occurs, the pan rests directly on the bedrock."

The soils formed in a veneer of wind modified alluvium with a strong loess influence.  The climate is middle latitude steppe (Trewartha's Modified Koppen System), with cool moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost free season is 140 to 160 days."
