  "OVERVIEW": "The Tulia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous eolian sediments derived mainly from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on very gently to strongly sloping plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 48 cm (18 in.) and the mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
