  "OVERVIEW": "The Tusayan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Tusayan soils are on hills, plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
