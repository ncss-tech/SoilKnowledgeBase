  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenot series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in thick deposits of loess under grass vegetation.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping, broad stream divides.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 100 inches.  Grayish mottles due to wetness occur throughout the solum.  Sand content is typically less than 3 percent but ranges\nto 10 percent.\nColors of the A1 or Ap horizon are dark gray (10YR 4/1), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), gray (10YR 5/1), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  It is silt loam.  The horizon ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe A2 horizon is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4).  It is silt loam.  The horizon ranges from very strongly acid through medium acid. The horizon boundary between A2 and Bt is abrupt and smooth with up to 10 percent interfingering.\nThe surfaces of peds in the upper Bt horizon are dark gray (10YR 4/1), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), gray (10YR 5/1), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  The interiors have colors of the surfaces with 40 to 70 percent mottles of red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8), or yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6, 4/8, 5/8).  It is silty clay loam ranging up to 35 percent clay.  The upper Bt horizon is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe lower Bt horizons are brown (10YR 5/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8) with gray and red mottles.  They are silty clay loam or silt loam.  These horizons range from strongly acid through neutral."

Crowley soils are grayer and\nhave finer textured control sections.  Dundee and Patoutville soils lack an abrupt textural change between A and B horizons. Mamou soils have sola less than 50 inches thick and more than 10 percent total sand.  Springfield soils have fine textured B horizons.  Vidrine soils are browner and have finer textured lower B horizons."

They formed in thick deposits of pre-Peorian age loess under grass vegetation.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Temperature averages about 68 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is about 58 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E index is about 70."

Evangeline soils\nare yellowish red and occur at lower elevations on stronger slopes.  Frost soils are gray and are in the concave drainageways downslope from the Tenot soils.  Where pimple mounds are present\nthey are associated with the Duralde soils."
