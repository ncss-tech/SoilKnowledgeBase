  "OVERVIEW": "The Toolesboro series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvial sediments on bottomlands.  They are moderate or moderately rapidly permeable in the solum and very rapidly permeable in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 30 to 50 inches.  Carbonates are not present in the solum and typically are lacking to depths of several feet.  The control section averages about 8 to 18 percent clay and 65 to 80 percent total sand.  The sand fraction is more than 50 percent medium sand or coarser.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.  The gravel typically is less than 1 cm in diameter.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  It is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.  A BA horizon is in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon ranges from loam to sandy loam in the upper part grading to loamy sand or sand in the lower part.  It has hue of 5YR through 10YR with value of 3, 4, or 5 and chroma of 1 through 4.  Mottles of high and low chroma are present.  The upper part of the Bw horizon ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid while the lower part ranges from neutral to medium acid.  A BC horizon is in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is loamy sand, coarse sand, or sand.  Reaction ranges from neutral to medium acid."

Corunna soils have loamy or silty calcareous 2C horizons above 40 inches.  Darfur soils are higher in fine and very fine sand, are shallower to carbonates, and lack hues of 7.5YR or redder.  Dassel soils have distinct textural stratification in the Bw horizons and are shallower to free carbonates.  Gilford soils have free carbonates in the 2C horizon and are in areas receiving greater rainfall.  Hanska soils are shallower to carbonates and have 2.5Y or 5Y hues in the Bw horizon.  Jubilee soils have cooler temperatures and mean annual precipitation less than 15 inches.  Lyles soils are stratified in the lower part of the solum and lack hues of 7.5YR or redder.  Ambraw and Shaffton soils are fine-loamy.  Gannett soils typically have free carbonates in the surface and have a thinner solum.  Granby soils average more sand in the control section."
