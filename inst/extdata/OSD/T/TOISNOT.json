  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the upper boundary of the fragipan commonly ranges from 20 to 40 inches but in some areas it ranges from 10 to 45 inches.  In wet seasons, the fragipan is dry to moist, whereas, the adjacent horizons are saturated.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the profile, unless the surface has been limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N, value of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N, value of 6 or 7.  Texture is commonly loamy sand, sandy loam, sand, or silt loam.\nThe Btg/Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe Ex horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, and may have white or pale brown mottles or bodies.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  The clay content ranges from 2 to 18 percent and is usually on the lower end of the range.  The white bodies have less clay, whereas, the grayer and browner materials have more clay.  The proportion of brittle material is about 60 percent of the matrix which is brittle or slightly hard.  A dry fragment slakes or fractures when placed in water.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and yellow range from few to many.  In some pedons, the Btg2 horizon is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Texture is commonly sandy clay loam, but ranges to include fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay.\nThe 2Cg horizon is gray or is mottled.  Texture is variable including sandy, loamy, or clayey sediments.  This horizon is stratified and includes gravelly layers in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Mashulaville is the only series in the same family.  Bibb, Lynchburg, Myatt, Plummer, Rains, and Rutlege series are in related families.  Mashulaville soils contain more silt or more very fine sand in all horizons and more clay in the fragipan.  Bibb, Lynchburg, Myatt, Plummer, Rains, and Rutlege soils lack fragipans.  In addition, Lynchburg soils have browner colors."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Toisnot soils are in shallow depressions, around the heads of drainageways, and on the outer fringe of stream terraces next to the better drained uplands, in the upper Coastal Plain.  They occupy the transition areas between soils with contrasting drainage.  On some landscapes, these soils extend down shallow drainageways for short distances.  Slopes are generally less than 2 percent.  The soil formed in moderately coarse textured fluvial or marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual rainfall is 49 inches and mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F."

Except for Portsmouth soils, all of these soils are on the adjacent higher landscapes and have better drainage and lack fragipans.  Portsmouth soils have umbric epipedons, are fine-loamy, and lack fragipans."

Native trees include oak, maple, sweetgum, yellow-poplar, and loblolly pine, with understory plants as sweet bay, myrtle, gallberry, and smilax.  Small acreages have been cleared and used for pasture, corn, and soybeans."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Toisnot soils formerly were included in the Bibb, Plummer, and Rains series and classified in the Low Humic-Gley great soil group.  The brittle layer of this soil will not qualify as a fragipan, but is placed here due to pragmatic reasons.  This layer appears to fit the concept of a densipan as described by Dr. Smith in SSSA Proceedings, volume 39, page 369-370.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  North Carolina State University Soils Department.
