  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 15 to 32 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 30 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 60 inches. The soil ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the A, E, and B horizons, 5 to 35 percent in the 2E/Bx and 2BC horizons and 15 to 70 percent in the 2C horizons. Cobble and stone content ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the A, E, and B horizons and from 0 to 25 percent in the 2E/Bx, 2Btx and 2C horizons. The volume of rock fragments averages from 10 to 30 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and E horizons are gravelly or cobbly analogues of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The Bs horizon is subdivided in some pedons. The B horizons are fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe E part of the 2E/Bx horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The B part has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. The 2E/Bx horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the gravelly analogues of these textures. The fragipan in this horizon is very hard or extremely hard when dry and firm to extremely firm when moist.\nThe 2Btx horizon has colors and textures similar to the B part of the 2E/Bx horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is gravelly fine sand, gravelly loamy fine sand, gravelly loamy very fine sand, or the very gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy fine sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, or the very gravelly analogues of these textures. The material contains abundant basalt and andesite amygdaloids and conglomerates."

They have formed in a loamy eolian mantle underlain by gravelly loamy or sandy glacial till derived from the Portage Lake Lava Series. Slope ranges from 8 to 70 percent. The local climate is affected by Lake Superior causing high snowfall. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 36 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric horizon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (Oa and E horizons);\nalbic horizon--the zone from a depth of 1 to 5 inches (E horizon);\nspodic horizon--the zone from a depth of 5 to 27 inches (Bhs and Bs horizons);\nfragipan--the zone from a depth of 27 to 46 inches (2E/Bx and 2Btxhorizon).\nglossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 27 to 34 inches (2E/Bx horizon);\nargillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 27 to 46 inches (2E/Bx and 2Btx horizons) - this zone meets the requirements for an argillic horizon because of the lithologic discontinuity and the presence of clay films;\nultic subgroup--the argillic horizon has base saturation less than 35 percent.\nThe moderately well drained phase is no longer within the series concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA: For laboratory data on this pedon refer to S86MI-061-002 from the NSSL\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
