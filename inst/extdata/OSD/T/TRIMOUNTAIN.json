  "OVERVIEW": "The Trimountain series consists of well drained soils formed in a loamy eolian mantle underlain by gravelly loamy or sandy glacial till on ground moraines and end moraines. Permeability is moderate in the upper part, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the pedon. Slope ranges from 8 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 60 inches. The soil ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the A, E, and B horizons, 5 to 35 percent in the 2E/Bx and 2BC horizons and 15 to 70 percent in the 2C horizons.
