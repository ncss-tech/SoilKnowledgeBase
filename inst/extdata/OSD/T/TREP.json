    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 22 to 35 percent.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon has colors with one or two units of value greater than the A horizon.  The A and E horizons are loamy fine sand or fine sand.  The reaction of the A & E horizons ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid unless limed.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red or brown, range from few to common.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are below a depth of 30 inches.  Texture is sandy clay loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon is typically mottled in shades of gray, brown, or red.  Some pedons have a grayish or brownish matrix with yellow or red mottles.  Texture is clay or sandy clay.  The reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

In addition, Lowndes soils have hue redder than 10YR in the upper Bt horizon. Bonneau, Letney, Rosalie and Wagram soils lack clayey lower Bt horizons.  Boykin, Briley, and Lucy soils have hue redder than 10YR throughout the Bt horizon.  Lovett soils are in a wetter climatic and receive more than 50 inches of precipitation annually."
