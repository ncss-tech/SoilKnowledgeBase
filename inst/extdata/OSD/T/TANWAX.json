  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The limnic materials in which this soil formed range in thickness from 52 inches to more than 15 feet.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 49 degrees F.  The soils are usually saturated with water.  They are medium to strongly acid.  The control section is dominantly coprogenous earth (sedimentary peat), diatomaceous earth, and volcanic ash.  Fiber content ranges from 5 to 40 percent when unrubbed and less than 10 percent rubbed.  Fibers are mostly from spirea, alder, and grass.  The tiers have value of 2, 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The upper part of the surface tier has distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) or dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) mottles in some pedons."

The climate is mild and humid.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 70 inches; the mean January temperature is 40 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 57 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.  The average frost free season is about 160 days."
