  "OVERVIEW": "The Toronto series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
