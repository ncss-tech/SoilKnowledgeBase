  "OVERVIEW": "The Townhole series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on strath terraces, structural benches, and terraces. They formed in colluvium and the underlying slope alluvium and old alluvium and/or residuum from cherty limestone, dolomite, or shale. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",
