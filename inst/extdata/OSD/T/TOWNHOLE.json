These soils formed in cherty or silty colluvium, slope alluvium and old alluvium and/or residuum from cherty limestone, dolomite, or shale in Mississippian geology. The mean annual temperature varies from 57 to 59 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 48 inches."

Jollymill soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Goss soils have a clayey-skeletal particle size class. Rueter soils are somewhat excessively drained. Hailey soils are excessively drained. Jollymill, Rueter, and Goss soils are on side slopes. Hailey soils are on shoulder slopes and side slopes."
