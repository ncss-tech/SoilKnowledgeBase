Bowbells, Flaxton, Hereford, Pachel, and Weed soils are calcareous above a depth of 40 inches or immediately below the solum if thicker than 40 inches and have continuous horizons of visible calcium carbonate accumulation. Carfall soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and elevations less than 3500 feet.  Center Creek soils contain mottles within 20 to 40 inches and are somewhat poorly drained. Cambern and Chugcreek soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Detra, Hesperus, Schauson, and Weed soils have mean summer soil temperatures above 57 degrees F. Fiesta soils have rock fragments derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Jaythree soils formed in alluvium derived from arkosic sandstone and shale. Shermap soils formed in eolian deposits, and slope alluvium derived from sandstone. Tschicoma soils formed in slope alluvium derived from latite, dacite, and rhyolitic tuff. In addition, Detra soils formed in materials derived from limestone, sandstone, and shale; Hesperus soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR; and Schauson soils have moisture control sections that are dry for 50 to 55 percent of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Laceycreek soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR. Bowbells, Carfall, Chugcreek, Flaxton, Hesperus, Laceycreek, Ohwiler, and Pachel soils are in LRRs E, F, and G and are moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Todacheene soils are on footslopes and fan terraces of mesas and calderas. They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary basalt and basaltic tuff. Slopes are 5 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Owlspring soils are fine-silty, somewhat poorly drained, and occur on adjacent toeslopes.  Sonsela soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes. Viewpoint soils are shallow to basalt, and occur on adjacent shoulders and knolls. Washpass soils are coarse-loamy, have a cryic temperature regime, and occur on north-facing slopes."

(Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nThe Todacheene series was originally proposed and later dropped from the adjacent Fort Defiance Area soil survey.\nADDITIONAL DATA: A pedon within this series concept was sampled by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) at the original type location as pedon # S86-NM-045-001. Organic carbon values were extrapolated from this data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
