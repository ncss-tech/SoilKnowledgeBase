  "OVERVIEW": "The Twinmound series consists of excessively drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone on hills on bedrock controlled uplands.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone or in siliceous sandy colluvium, or both.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy residuum and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 6 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sand or sand.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sand or sand or the channery analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Bw horizons with spodic colors have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.

Shelldrake and Simescreek soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Arbutus soils have a lithic contact of igneous or metamorphic bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Boone soils are mesic.  Ludington soils have a spodic horizon. Plainbo soils have mixed mineralogy."
