Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the solum.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sand or sand.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sand or sand or the channery analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Bw horizons with spodic colors have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon. The Bw is fine sand or sand or the channery analogs.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 3 to 8; or, value of 7 or 8; and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is fine sand or sand or the channery analogs.\nThe Cr horizon has color like the BC horizon described above."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Shelldrake and Simescreek series.  Similar soils are the Arbutus, Boone, Ludington, and Plainbo series.  Shelldrake and Simescreek soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Arbutus soils have a lithic contact of igneous or metamorphic bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Boone soils are mesic.  Ludington soils have a spodic horizon. Plainbo soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone or in siliceous sandy colluvium, or both. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period rages from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 t0 1400 feet."

The well drained Dobie soils are on summits and shoulders at slightly higher elevations than Twinmound soils where there is a 20 to 40 inch thick loess mantle over glauconitic sandstone.  The well drained Hayriver soils are on landscape positions similar to those of Twinmound soils where there is 20 to 40 inches of loamy residuum over glauconitic sandstone."
