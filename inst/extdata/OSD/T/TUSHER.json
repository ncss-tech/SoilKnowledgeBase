  "OVERVIEW": "The Tusher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and/or eolian sands derived from sedimentary rocks.  Tusher soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, fan remnants, stream terraces, or structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
