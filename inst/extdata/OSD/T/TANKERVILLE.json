These soils were formerly mapped in the Chester and Brandywine series.\nREVISED = 2/18/2004, MAV added active ce activity class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na)  Ochric epipedon - zone from surface to 4 inches (Ap horizon).\nb)  Argillic horizon - zone from 4 to 40 inches (Bt and BCt horizons).\nc)  Paralithic contact - at 35 inches (top of Cr horizon).\nd)  Lithic contact - at 40 inches (top of the R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Mechanical, mineralogical, and chemical analyses performed by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University staff.  In addition, 7 other pedons have been sampled for PSA and 3 for chemistry.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
