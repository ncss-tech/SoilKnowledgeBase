  "OVERVIEW": "The Trey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in sandy sediments underlain by soft sandstone on uplands. Permeability is rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil does not have carbonates, but the bedrock material has free carbonates in some layers of most pedons.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline above the bedrock and from neutral to very strongly alkaline in the bedrock.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches, but typically is between depths of 27 to 38 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically loamy fine sand, but is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or fine sand in some pedons.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  Some pedons do not have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is fine sand, or loamy fine sand but is loamy sand or sand in some pedons.  A thin horizon resting above the bedrock is mottled in some pedons.  Some pedons have dark colored buried horizons below depths of 25 inches.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 8 and 2 to 7 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is weakly cemented sandstone or siltstone, but some pedons have thin layers of clay shale.  It crushes to fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam."
