  "OVERVIEW": "The Tabler series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy or clayey alluvial sediments.  These soils are on broad nearly level to very gently sloping summits of paleoterraces on an alluvial plain in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A). Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent but range up to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 852 mm (33 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
