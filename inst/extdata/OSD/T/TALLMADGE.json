  "OVERVIEW": "The Tallmadge series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift that is underlain by limestone or dolostone bedrock on ground moraines, outwash plains, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 990 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Tallmadge series was proposed for the areas of Selma bedrock substratum phase that was recognized in the June 1979 \"Soil Survey of Kankakee County Illinois\". The name Tallmadge is from a town in Pembroke Township in Kankakee County, Illinois.\nDiagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 43 cm (0 to17 inches) (Ap, A, and AB horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 43 to 84 cm (17 to 33 inches) (Btg1 and Btg2); lithologic discontinuity at a depth of 84 cm (33 inches) - the contact between the Btg2 and 2BCg horizons; lithic contact - at a depth of 109 cm (43 inches); aquic conditions - redoximorphic features present in the zone from 43 to 109 cm (17 to 43 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, and 2BCg horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab sample data (S02IL-091-018) is on file in the MLRA project office, Aurora, Illinois, and at the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
