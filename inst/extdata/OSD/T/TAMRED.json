  "OVERVIEW": "The Tamred series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt.  These soils are on south facing mountainsides.  Slopes are 20 to 60 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the average annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
