  "OVERVIEW": "The Tyre series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy drift and the underlying residuum weathered from sandstone bedrock. Tyre soils are on till plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
