  "OVERVIEW": "The Taylorsflat series consists of very deep, well drained, moderate or moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments from igneous and sedimentary rocks on fan remnants, lake terraces, fan skirts, alluvial flats, and lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
