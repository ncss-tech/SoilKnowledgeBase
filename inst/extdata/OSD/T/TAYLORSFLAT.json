Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediment from a wide range of rock formations.  The climate is semiarid.   Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F, and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."
