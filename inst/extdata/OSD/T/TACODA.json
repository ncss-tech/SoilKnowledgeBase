  "OVERVIEW": "The Tacoda series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains. These soils formed in sandy outwash overlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
