  "OVERVIEW": "The Thatcherflats series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty alluvium on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is slow. Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Chesbrook soils lack an argillic horizon. Wursten soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Bear Lake and Chesbrook soils are commonly found in poorly drained depressional to flat positions. Lago soils are on slightly convex to smooth areas and are in complex with Bear Lake soils. Wursten soils occur on low to high terraces on well drained positions."
