  "STATES": "MD,PA,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Trego series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeability soils. They formed in acid alluvial materials with colluvial influences, weathered from metamorphic crystalline rocks. They occur on nearly level old alluvial fans and gently sloping colluvial foot slopes of the Blue Ridge province. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Average annual temperature is 52 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is 37 inches.",
