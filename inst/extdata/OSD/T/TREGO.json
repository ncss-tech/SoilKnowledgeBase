Closely related soils are the Cookport, Glenville, and Raritan soils which have a fragipan, and the Adelphia, Bigpool, Blaiton, Holmdel, Kensington, Trackler, Wharton, Whiteside, and Woodstown soils which lack fragic properties. All of these soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Trego soils are on nearly level to slightly concave alluvial fans, and colluvial footslopes. Slopes ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in alluvial materials with colluvial influences weathered from metamorphic crystalline rocks. Average annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches. Climate is temperate and humid."
