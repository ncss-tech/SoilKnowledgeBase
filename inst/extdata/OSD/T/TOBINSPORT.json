  "OVERVIEW": "The Tobinsport series consists of very deep, well drained soils on loess covered dunes on stream terraces. They formed in loess and the underlying loamy and sandy materials. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
