  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuskahoma series consists of shallow, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from shales of Pennsylvania Age.  These soils are on crest of ridges or convex uplands in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains.  Slopesare 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 46 inches.",

Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, stony silt loam, stony loam, or stony silty clay loam.  Content of coarse fragments of sandstone ranges from 0 to 30 percent by volume.  About 0 to 10 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 0 to 20 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a A2 horizon from 1 to 4 inches thick.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture and content of coarse fragments are similar to the\nA1 horizon.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of red, brown, gray, or yellow.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, shaly clay, shaly silty clay, or shaly silty clay loam.  Content of coarse fragments of shale ranges from 0 to 30 percent by volume and are less than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe B3 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of brown, red, or gray.  Texture is shaly clay, shaly silty clay, shaly silty clay loam, very shaly clay, very shaly silty clay, or very shaly silty clay loam.  Content of coarse fragments of shale ranges from 20 to 50 percent by volume and are less than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of l to 4.  It is shale bedrock that is tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

Barden, Bushnell, Homa, Liberal, Tupelo, and Wister soils have sola more than 20 inches thick.  In addition, Barden and Liberal soils have Ap or A1 horizons of moist color values less than 4 in the upper 7 inches after mixing and lack abrupt textural changes between the A and B horizons.  Bushnell soils have hyperthermic temperature regimes and Homa soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Bub soils lack wetness mottles.  Talihina soils lack Bt horizons and have mollic epipedons."

Bahiagrass, tall,  fescue, and improved bermudagrass are the main tame pasture plants."
