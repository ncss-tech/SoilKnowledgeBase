These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2032 to 2794 millimeters (80 to 110 inches). Mean January temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F); and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F).  The frost free period is about 75 to 150 days."
