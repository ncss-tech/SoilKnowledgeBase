  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 22 to 35 inches thick over bedrock. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 69 to 72 degrees F. The soils are usually dry during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months and are dry for 70 to 85 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice. The soils are mildly or moderately alkaline and are noncalcareous to depths of 30 inches or more.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from very cobbly light clay loam to very cobbly sandy loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. It ranges from gravelly heavy clay loam to cobbly clay or sandy clay and contains 20 to 40 percent rock fragments. This horizon ranges from 13 to 26 inches thick."

Bew, Cerrillos, Lonti, Panky, Poley, Silver and Thurlow soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Malposa soils are calcareous throughout. Bew, Cerrillos, Panky, Renohill, Silver and Thurlow soils have horizons of carbonate accumulation at depths of less than 30 inches. Norrest soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

These soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 57 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 70 to 73 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. Frost-free period is 160 to 170 days."
