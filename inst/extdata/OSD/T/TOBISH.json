  "OVERVIEW": "The Tobish series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that were formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. These soils are on gently sloping to steep mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 22 to 35 inches thick over bedrock. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 69 to 72 degrees F. The soils are usually dry during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months and are dry for 70 to 85 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice. The soils are mildly or moderately alkaline and are noncalcareous to depths of 30 inches or more.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from very cobbly light clay loam to very cobbly sandy loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. It ranges from gravelly heavy clay loam to cobbly clay or sandy clay and contains 20 to 40 percent rock fragments. This horizon ranges from 13 to 26 inches thick."
