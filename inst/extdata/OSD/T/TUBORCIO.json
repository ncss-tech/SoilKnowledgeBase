  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuborcio series consists of deep to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from granite. The Tuborcio soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).",
