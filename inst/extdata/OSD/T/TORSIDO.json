    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges 41 degrees to 44 degrees F., mean summer temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 60 degrees F.  The soils range from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in a majority of subhorizons within the solum.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent within the epipedon and the argillic horizon.  Depth to the coarse textured IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the major part of the solum.  These are mainly 1 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe B2tg horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 through 2.  This horizon ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay and averages 15 to 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe C1g when present above the IIc horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.  Clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent in any C horizon above the IIC horizon.\nThe IIC horizon has colors similar to the C horizon."

The soil formed in moderately thin, noncalcareous, medium to moderately fine textured alluvium from basalt and overlying beds of sand and gravel which are also of basalt origin.  The average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 56 to 58 degrees F."
