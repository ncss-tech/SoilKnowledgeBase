These soils formed in glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches and is mainly rain in early spring and late fall.  Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 130 days."
