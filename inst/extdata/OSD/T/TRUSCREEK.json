  "OVERVIEW": "The Truscreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
