Slayton soils are moderately coarse textured in the control section, contain pumice, and have sandy tuff or breccia bedrock above depth of 20 inches.  Calzacorta and Starbuck soils lack Bkq horizons.  Calzacorta soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trevino soils are on basalt plains, buttes, terraces, and terrace side slopes and plug domes, lava flow lobes, pressure ridges and tumuli on shield volcanoes and lava plains.  Elevations are 2,000 to 5,400 feet.  The soils formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash mixed with alluvium and colluvium from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The climate is semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches, average annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F., and the frost free season is 110 to 160 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 5 inches (A and AB horizons)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 3 to 13 inches (AB and Bw horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 18 inches.\nLithic contact - The boundary at approximately 18 inches\nSoil moisture regime - aridic bordering xeric\nGeographic setting - terms used throughout MLRA 11 to identify the setting of this soil are quite varied although all equate to the same landscape.  There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe classification of this pedon has been revised as of 4/00 from loamy, mixed, mesic Lithic Xerollic Camborthids to loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplocambids based on revisions to Soil Taxomony.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered volcanic ash soil mantle by overland flow of running water.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
