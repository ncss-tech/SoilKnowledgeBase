    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees F. The soil below a depth of about 8 inches and the lithic contact is usually moist in some parts from November until April or May 1, is moist in all parts at least 45 consecutive days and is dry the rest of the year. Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent and decreases regularly with depth. Fragments of shale occupy 35 to 50 percent of the soil profile. Base saturation is greater than 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 4/3. Moist colors are 10YR 3/2 or 3/3. It is very shaly sandy loam, or very shaly loam. Clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent. It has weak granular or moderate subangular blocky structure and is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hambright series and the Friant, Lodo, and Lopez series in other families. Hambright soils have a Bw horizon, are neutral to medium acid, and have weathered from basalt bedrock.  Friant and Lodo have less than 35 percent rock fragments. Lopez soils have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent and have properties that suggest some amorphous materials occur in the soil or parent material."

Elevations are 2,700 to 4,300 feet. The climate is semi-arid with warm to hot dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Mean January temperature is 44 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 81 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 60 degrees to 62 degrees F. Frost-free season is 175 to 225 days."
