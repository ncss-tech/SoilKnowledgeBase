The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and sandy glacial outwash.  Tromp soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."

Characterization data are available on these soils.  Laboratory number S81WA-073-4.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 11 inches, and a spodic horizon from 11 to 26 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but does have micro morphology, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
