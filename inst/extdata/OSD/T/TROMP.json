Characterization data are available on these soils.  Laboratory number S81WA-073-4.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 11 inches, and a spodic horizon from 11 to 26 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but does have micro morphology, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets."
