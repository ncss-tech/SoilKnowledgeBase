  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 8 feet.  Depth to fragipan ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments of diabase range from less than 5 to 10 percent in the Ap and Btg horizons and from 5 to 30 percent in the lower Btg, Bx and C horizons.  Limited laboratory data reveals a fairly even distribution of illite, kaolinite, vermiculite and montmorillonite clay minerals.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  In undisturbed areas, the A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has very coarse prismatic to fine medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8 with low chroma coatings on faces of prisms.  Texture is loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction with more sand and less silt with increasing depth.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y.  Texture range from sandy loam through clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. The Frenchtown, Hasbrouck, and Loysville series are in the closely related family.  Frenchtown and Hasbrouck soils do not have rock fragments dominated by basic rocks.  Loysville soils have rock fragments dominated by angular chert fragments and do not have prismatic structure in the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Towhee soils are in upland flats and depressions with slopes up to 8 percent.  The soils developed in colluvium or residuum from basic rocks such as diabase, diorite or gabbro.  The climate is temperate and humid.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 46 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F., and the growing season ranges from 150 to 200 days."

Brecknock, Gladstone, Glenelg,  Legore, Lehigh, Mount Lucas, and Neshaminy soils do not have fragipans.  Calvert, Croton, and Doylestown soils have less than 15 percent sand, coarser than very fine sand, plus rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Glenville is  moderately well drained or somewhat poorly drained soils. They formed primarily in colluvium or residuum affected by soil creep that is weathered from phyllite, micaceous schist, gneiss and other acid crystalline rocks."
