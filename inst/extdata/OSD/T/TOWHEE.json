Rock fragments of diabase range from less than 5 to 10 percent in the Ap and Btg horizons and from 5 to 30 percent in the lower Btg, Bx and C horizons.  Limited laboratory data reveals a fairly even distribution of illite, kaolinite, vermiculite and montmorillonite clay minerals.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  In undisturbed areas, the A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has very coarse prismatic to fine medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8 with low chroma coatings on faces of prisms.  Texture is loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction with more sand and less silt with increasing depth.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y.  Texture range from sandy loam through clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Brecknock, Gladstone, Glenelg,  Legore, Lehigh, Mount Lucas, and Neshaminy soils do not have fragipans.  Calvert, Croton, and Doylestown soils have less than 15 percent sand, coarser than very fine sand, plus rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Glenville is  moderately well drained or somewhat poorly drained soils. They formed primarily in colluvium or residuum affected by soil creep that is weathered from phyllite, micaceous schist, gneiss and other acid crystalline rocks."
