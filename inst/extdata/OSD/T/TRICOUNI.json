  "OVERVIEW": "The Tricouni series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and glacial drift over glacial drift on terraces, debris cones, and valley walls.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
