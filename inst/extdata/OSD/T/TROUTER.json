The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 98 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent. Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average from 0 to 10 percent. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It has 5 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 or 4 moist. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel."
