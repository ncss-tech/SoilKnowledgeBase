The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 98 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent. Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average from 0 to 10 percent. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It has 5 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 or 4 moist. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel."

Summers are warm and dry; winters are cool and wet, with snow cover from December through March. The mean annual precipitation is 48 to 52 inches. The mean January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 85 to 110 days."

Underwood soils are fine-loamy, have an argillic horizon and are on backslopes of mountains. Volash soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and are on plains. Chemawa soils are on terraces and backslopes."
