  "OVERVIEW": "The Tupman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and/or sedimentary rock. The Tupman soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 178 mm (7 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
