Chenega soils do not have spodic horizons, are sandy-skeletal, and are on floodplains. Jakolof soils are on stream terraces. Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic matter accumulated in depressions. Kasitsna soils occur on glacial moraines and in complex with Seldovia and Tutka soils on mountain slopes."
