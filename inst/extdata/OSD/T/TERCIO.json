  "OVERVIEW": "The Tercio series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale and siltstone.  Tercio soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
