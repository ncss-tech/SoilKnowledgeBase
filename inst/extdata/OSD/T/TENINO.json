  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenino series consists of moderately deep to cemented pan, well drained soils formed in glacial till.  Tenino soils are on terminal moraines and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
