These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Coarse fragments  in the control section average from 20 to 35 percent including up to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR moist and 10YR or 7.5YR dry,  value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y value of 3 through 5 and 6 or 7 dry, chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.\nThe 2Bsm horizon averages from 50 to 80 percent pebbles.\nThe 2C horizon is extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It has 60 to 90 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

These soils formed in glacial till over glacial outwash.  Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F; average July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F) is 150 to 200 days.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches."
