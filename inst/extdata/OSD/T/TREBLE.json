  "OVERVIEW": "The Treble series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, foothills and escarpments. They formed in till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 660 mm and, mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.",
