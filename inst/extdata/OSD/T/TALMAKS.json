  "OVERVIEW": "The Talmaks series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hills of plateaus.  They formed in loess with small amounts of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",
