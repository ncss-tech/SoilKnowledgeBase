    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Talmaks soils are on hills of loess-covered basalt plateaus at elevations of 4,200 to 4,750 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in loess, which contains a small amount of volcanic ash in the upper layers.  The average annual temperature ranges from 42 to 43 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 26 inches.  The average frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
