    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trid soils are on mountain back slopes, with mainly a south aspect at elevations of 1,370 to 2,286 meters.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in residuum derived from granitic rocks with some colluvial influence.  The climate is dry, with warm summers and moist, cool winters.  The average annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mainly as snow; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.  The frost- free season is 90 to 110 days."
