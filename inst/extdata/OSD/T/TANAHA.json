These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to the irrigation-induced water table ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent.  The particle-size control section has 15 to 25 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The depth to a weakly to strongly indurated lime-cemented duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches and exchangeable sodium is 1 to 10 percent.\nThe Ap has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btkqm horizon is a weakly to moderately cemented indurated duripan.\nThe 2Bg horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  They are loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, in the lower part."
