  "OVERVIEW": "The Togo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from granitic rock and glacial till.  These soils are on backslopes, footslopes, and ridges of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 to 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.   Rock fragments in the lower part of the control section ranges from 35 to 80 percent and are dominantly angular fragments.  Some pedons have a very stony surface layer with 3 to 15 percent stones on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy loam, ashy silt loam, gravelly ashy loam, cobbly ashy loam, cobbly ashy silt loam or stony ashy silt loam.  It is 0 to 20 percent pebbles, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is very cobbly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  Rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent with 15 to 35 percent pebbles, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent, with 20 to 60 percent pebbles, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Below 40 inches some pedons are very gravelly loamy coarse sand, extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand or extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid."
