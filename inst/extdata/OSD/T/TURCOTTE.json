  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches thick.  Secondary carbonates in the form of films and threads or soft masses occur within a depth of 20 inches. Electrical conductivity of the saturated extract is less than 2 mmhos/cm in the A horizon and ranges to as much as 4 mmhos/cm within 80 inches.  Texture variations or stratifications are presumed to be lithologic discontinuities and occur in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 1OYR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Moist values are less than 3.5.  Combined thickness ranges from 8 to 18 inches thick.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  Organic matter content ranges from 1.0 to 2.5 percent.  Reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline and also ranges from noneffervescent to slightly effervescent.\nThe B horizon has hue of 1OYR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Visible secondary carbonates in the form of concretions and soft masses ranges from few to common.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 1OYR, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Similar soils are Czar, Hidalgo, Lalinda and Yturria series.  Czar soils have a argillic horizon.  Hidalgo soils have a calcic horizon and a calcareous surface layer.  Lalinda soils lack mollic epipedon and typically are more saline.  Yturria soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Turcotte soils occupy gently sloping to strongly sloping convex ridges that are generally located on the windward and leeward margins of saline playas.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in loamy eolian sediments of Holocene Age.  These sediments are referred to as the \"clay dunes\" on the Geologic Atlas of Texas.  The Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 28 to 38."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Padrones, Palobia, Quiteria, Sauz and Yturria soils. Padrones, Palobia and Quiteria soils occur in lower positions and have mottled natric horizons.  Sauz soils occur in depressions and in drainageways and have an aquic moisture regime.  Yturria soils occur on similar surfaces."
