  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Turupah series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Turupah soils are on delta plains, lake plains, and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
