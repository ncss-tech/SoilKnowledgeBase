    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Turupah soils are on delta plains, lake plains, and alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 1128 to 1300 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Carson, Stillwater, Mackerlake, Lahontan, and Pelic soils.  Carson soils are very-fine, have mollic epipedons, and have horizons with slickensides and high linear extensibility.  Stillwater soils have mollic epipedons.  Mackerlake soils have mollic epipedons.  Lahontan soils are fine textured and have an aridic (torric) moisture regime.  Pelic soils are sandy."
