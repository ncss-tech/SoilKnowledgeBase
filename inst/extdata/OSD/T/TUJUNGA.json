  "OVERVIEW": "The Tujunga series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitic sources. Tujunga soils are on alluvial fans and floodplains, including urban areas. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Map units of Tujunga soil which occur at elevations above 1500 feet should probably be set up as a new series during MLRA updates.  There are no taxonomic or series criteria to separate the high elevation soils. Tujunga soils mapped in the San Bernardino Co., S.W. part, Western Riverside Area, Tulare Co., Central part, occur above 1,500 feet in places and all of the Tujunga soil map units in the Kern Co., N. E. and S.E. parts are above 1,500 feet. Presently used in too many MLRAs: 14, 17, 18, 19, 29, 30.\nTujunga soils are being restricted to elevation range of 0 to 600 meters (0 to 1968 feet) in coastal plains and valleys in central and southern coastal areas of MLRA 14 and 19.\nType Location relocated to Valley Plaza Park in Los Angeles, CA during the Los Angeles County, Southeastern Part Soil Survey.  OSD was modified at this time.\nSurface disturbance (designated with the ^) is not series criteria and may or may not be present.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon: the zone from a depth of 0 to 4 cm\nHuman-transported materials: the zone from a depth of 0 to 21 cm\nParticle Size Control Section for this pedon: 25 to 100 cm\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNSSL Pedon No:  13N56584\nUser Site ID:   S2013CA037007, 2012Ca696538\nUser Pedon ID:  S2013CA037007\nClassified using the Twelfth Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2014)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
