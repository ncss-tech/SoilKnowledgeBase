  "OVERVIEW": "The Tolland consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from granite, schist and gneiss.  Tolland soils are on mountain slopes and footslopes. Slopes are 9 to 80 percent.  Elevation is 7,700 to 10,700 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
