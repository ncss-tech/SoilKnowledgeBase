The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid. It has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 grams/cubic centimeter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Chromas of 2 or 3 are limited to the upper 6 inches of the A horizon. Apparent clay content ranges from 10 to 15 percent. Hard 1 to 3mm concretions range from 10 to 35 percent of which 0 to 10 percent are greater than 2mm. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 moist and 6 dry. Apparent clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Hard 1 to 3mm concretions range from 5 to 10 percent of which 0 to 5 percent are greater than 2mm. It has 5 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. It is predominately medial silt loam, but is medial loam in some pedons.\nIf present, the C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 6 moist and dry."
