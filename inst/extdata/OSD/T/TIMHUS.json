  "OVERVIEW": "The Timhus series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils formed in windblown sediments and are on cinder cones.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
