  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Twinsi soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes  and shoulder slopes at elevations of 2,500 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 30 to  60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, and glacial till derived from dunite with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Twinsi soils are in a marine climate with cool moist summers and cold wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from November through May.  Average annual precipitation is 90 to 105 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 29 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.  The frost-free  season is 85 to 100 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from loamy-skeletal, serpentinitic Andic Cryochrepts to loamy-skeletal, serpentinitic Typic Cryorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a spodic horizon from 1 to 20 inches, 45 to 75 percent dunite fragments in the particle-size control section and a paralithic contact at 27 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but does meet micro morphological criteria, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
