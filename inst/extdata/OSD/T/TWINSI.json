  "OVERVIEW": "The Twinsi series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained  soils formed in colluvium and glacial till derived from dunite with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Twinsi soils are on glacially   modified mountain backslopes and shoulder slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 60  percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a spodic horizon from 1 to 20 inches, 45 to 75 percent dunite fragments in the particle-size control section and a paralithic contact at 27 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but does meet micro morphological criteria, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets."
