Delks and Susanna soils are on similar positions but Delks soils have clayey argillic horizons while Susanna soils have argillic horizons within 40 inches of the surface.  The Monteocha, Pomona, and Tocoi soils do not have ortstein.  In addition, the very poorly drained Monteocha soils are on lower positions, the poorly or very poorly drained Pomona soils are on higher positions."

The poorly and very poorly drained Ankona, Immokalee, and Waveland soils are on similar to lower positions and have spodic horizons between 30 and 50 inches from the surface.  In addition, Immokalee soils do not have ortstein or argillic horizons while Waveland soils do not have argillic horizons.  The very poorly drained Basinger soils are on lower positions, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  EauGallie, Oldsmar, and Wabasso soils are on similar positions, have more than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon, and lack ortstein.  In addition, Oldsmar soils have spodic horizons between 30 and 50 inches from the surface.  Jonathan and Salerno soils have spodic horizons 50 inches below the surface and do not have argillic horizons.  In addition, the somewhat poorly  to moderately well drained Jonathan soils are on higher knolls and low ridges in the flatwoods.  Lawnwood, Myakka, Pomona, and Wauchula soils are on similar flatwoods positions and have spodic horizons less than 30 inches below the surface.  In addition, Lawnwood soil do not have argillic horizons, Myakka soils lack argillic horizons and ortstein, Pomona soils do not have ortstein, and Wauchula soils have argillic horizons within a depth of 37 inches.  Pendarvis, Pomello, and St. Lucie soils are on knolls and high ridges.  In addition, the moderately well drained Pendarvis soils have spodic horizons between 30 and 50 inches below the surface, and do not have argillic horizons, while somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils have spodic horizons between 30 and 50 inches below the surface, and do not have argillic horizons, and do not have ortstein.  The excessively drained St. Lucie soils do not have spodic horizons and are sandy throughout."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Tantile soils are used for rangeland with lesser acreage planted to citrus, improved pasture grasses, and vegetables.  Some areas are used for community development.  The principal vegetation is longleaf pine and slash pine with an understory of sawpalmetto, running oak, pineland threeawn, and Florida threeawn.  Inkberry and fetterbush are in some places."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 26 inches (A1, A2, A3, Eg1, and Eg2 horizons.).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 26 to 49 inches (Bh1, Bh2, and the Bh portion of the Bw/Bh horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 69 to 80 inches (Btg horizon).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 59 to 69 inches (Eg horizon).\nOrtstein feature - the zone from 26 to 34 inches (Bh1 horizon).\nThese soils are saturated during the summer rainy season and after heavy rainfall in other seasons.\nTantile soils were formerly included in the Pomona series.  In situ saturated hydraulic conductivity rates of 13 tests at 5 sites show permeability to range from 0.0038 to 0.2091 in./hr. but dominantly less than 0.0778 in./hr.\nThe water table is within a depth of 10 inches for 2 to 4 months and 10 to 40 inches for 6 months or more during most years.  It is perched above the spodic horizon early in the summer rainy season and after periods of heavy rainfall in other seasons.  During extended dry periods, the water table recedes to below a depth of 40 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
