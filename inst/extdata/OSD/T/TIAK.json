Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has the same texture and reaction as the A horizon.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8 with reddish or brownish mottles.  Texture is clay or clay loam (35 to 50 percent clay).\nThe Bt2 horizon has the same colors as the Bt1 horizon with brownish, reddish, or grayish mottles.\nThe Bt3 horizon has coarse grayish, brownish, reddish, or yellowish mottles or has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 5 to 8 with reddish, brownish, grayish, or yellowish mottles.  Texture is clay but some pedons have pockets of clay loam or sandy clay loam (35 to 50 percent clay) in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is below 60 inches and is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon, where present, is mottled in shades of gray, red, or brown mottles.  Texture is clay that is stratified with sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or weathered shale.  Reaction is very strongly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ackwater, Angie, Chrysler, and Shuster series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Bengal, Boswell, Butusha, Carnasaw, Caroline, Collegedale, Duplin, Enders, Endsaw, Exum, Felker, Goldsboro, Gore, Izagora, Kirvin, Kullit, Persanti, Quitman, Sacul, Sawyer, Shubuta, Stapp, Turbeville, Vinita, and Wrightsboro series.  Ackwater, Angie, Chrysler, and Shuster series have an average absolute moisture deficit of less than 3 inches in July and August.  Bengal, Carnasaw, Enders, Endsaw, and Kirvin series lack wetness mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface and have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Boswell and Gore series have a base saturation of more than 35 percent.  Butusha, Caroline, Collegedale, Shubuta, and Turbeville series lack wetness mottles within the upper 30 inches of the soil surface.  Duplin and Persanti series have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Exum, Felker, and Sawyer series have fine-silty control sections.  Goldsboro, Izagora, Kullit, Quitman, and Wrightsboro series have fine-loamy control sections.  Sacul and Stapp series decrease in clay content by 20 percent or more from the maximum within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Vinita series have sola less than 60 inches thick."

These soils formed in clayey material of Cretaceous age.  The climate is humid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 72 to 80."
