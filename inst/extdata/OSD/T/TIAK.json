  "OVERVIEW": "The Tiak series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in mainly clayey material weathered from Cretaceous age.  These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on uplands in the Western Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 45 inches.",

Soils in similar families are the Bengal, Boswell, Butusha, Carnasaw, Caroline, Collegedale, Duplin, Enders, Endsaw, Exum, Felker, Goldsboro, Gore, Izagora, Kirvin, Kullit, Persanti, Quitman, Sacul, Sawyer, Shubuta, Stapp, Turbeville, Vinita, and Wrightsboro series.  Ackwater, Angie, Chrysler, and Shuster series have an average absolute moisture deficit of less than 3 inches in July and August.  Bengal, Carnasaw, Enders, Endsaw, and Kirvin series lack wetness mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface and have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Boswell and Gore series have a base saturation of more than 35 percent.  Butusha, Caroline, Collegedale, Shubuta, and Turbeville series lack wetness mottles within the upper 30 inches of the soil surface.  Duplin and Persanti series have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Exum, Felker, and Sawyer series have fine-silty control sections.  Goldsboro, Izagora, Kullit, Quitman, and Wrightsboro series have fine-loamy control sections.  Sacul and Stapp series decrease in clay content by 20 percent or more from the maximum within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Vinita series have sola less than 60 inches thick."
