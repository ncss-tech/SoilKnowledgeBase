  "OVERVIEW": "The Thomasfork series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on low stream terraces and flood plains. They formed in fine textured alluvium. Permeability is slow. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
