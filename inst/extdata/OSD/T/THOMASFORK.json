Bear Lake soils are poorly drained, have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and have fine-silty particle-size control sections. Bern soils are moderately well drained and have fine-silty particle-size control sections. Raynal soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section. Bear Lake soils are on floodplains on positions below Thomasfork soils. Bern soils are on stream terraces above Thomasfork soils. Raynal soils are on similar positions to Thomasfork soils but are located to the sides of Thomasfork."
