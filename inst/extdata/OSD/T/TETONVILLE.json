  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The part of the profile dark enough and high enough in organic matter to be a mollic epipedon is 6 to 10 inches thick. Depth to the IIC horizon is 10 to 25 inches. Some mottles with chroma of 2 or less are found below depth of 20 inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 degrees to 40 degrees F. The upper part of the control section has more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. When mixed, the control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments. The matrix material averages loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is fine sandy loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It contains discontinuous lenses of loamy sand, fine sandy loam and silt loam. Gravel and cobbles range from O to 70 percent. This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It has 45 to 70 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles. The matrix is sand or loamy sand. This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline."
