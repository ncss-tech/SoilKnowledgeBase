  "REVDATE": "09/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tibkey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or alpine till derived from fine grained igneous or metamorphic rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, drainageways and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
