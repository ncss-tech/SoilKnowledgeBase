The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock such as granodiorite.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 2 to 4 percent; Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mainly fine pebbles and cobbles.  Lithology of fragments are granitic rocks such as granodiorite and granite.\nReaction - Moderately acid to neutral (pH 5.6 to 7.3).\nA horizon - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist.\nC horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture:  Gravelly loamy coarse sand, cobbly loamy coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand; Some pedons have thin subhorizons of sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Toiyabe soils are on mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks such as granite and granodiorite.  Rock outcrops and boulders are common features of the landscape.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 8,000 feet in Nevada and California and are as low as 3,500 feet in Idaho.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F., and mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bonta, Corbett, Haypress, and Lasco soils.  Bonta soils are coarse-loamy, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and have argillic horizons.  Corbett soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Haypress soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have mollic epipedons.  Lasco soils are coarse-loamy, deep to paralithic contacts, and have argillic horizons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Toiyabe soils are used primarily for wildlife habitat and for watershed.  Commercial timber is harvested from less sloping areas.  Vegetation covers between 15 and 30 percent of the soil.  It is mainly a forest canopy of Jeffrey pine or ponderosa pine with an understory of serviceberry, antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, and grass.  The thicker timber stands have little or no understory.  Big sagebrush, bitterbrush, and rabbitbrush dominate in burned-over areas, especially on south exposures."

These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 22A.  Other acres are mapped in MLRA 43 in Idaho."
