    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tippipah soils are on smooth or slightly convex, nearly level alluvial fans with slope gradient of 0 to 2 percent.  Tippipah soils developed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from ignimbrite and basalt. These soils occur at an elevation of 1,520 to 1,590 meters in a cool, semi-arid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
