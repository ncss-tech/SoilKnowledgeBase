  "OVERVIEW": "The Tippipah series consists very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from ignimbrite and basalt. Tippipah soils are on alluvial fans and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
