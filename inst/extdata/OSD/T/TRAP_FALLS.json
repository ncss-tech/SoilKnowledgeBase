  "OVERVIEW": "The Trap Falls Series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on ground moraines. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow in the lower part and slow to very slow in the substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
