The well drained Watton, the moderately well drained Flintsteel, and the somewhat poorly drained Big Iron soils form a drainage sequence with Trap Falls and are on steeper or higher landscape positions. Poorly drained Gull Point soils are in drainageways. Moderately well drained Loggerhead and somewhat poorly drained Belding soils have coarser textured solums and are on higher landscape positions."
