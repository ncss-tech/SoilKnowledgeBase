  "OVERVIEW": "The Temvik series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a silty loess mantle overlying glacial till.  Permeability is moderate in the silty loess mantle and moderately slow in the glacial till.  These soils are on upland plains and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

The silty loess material contains between 18 and about 28 percent clay.  The soil ranges from neutral in the upper horizons to moderately alkaline in the lower horizons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam, loam or clay loam and contains between 10 and 30 percent very fine sand.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam, loam or clay loam and contains between 10 and 30 percent very fine sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon that formed in the underlying glacial till.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has few to many masses of carbonates and contains from 4 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Some pedons have 2BCk horizons.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon that formed in the silty loess material.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam glacial till containing 2 to 8 percent coarse fragments.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Soft bedded sandstone, siltstone or shale is below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amsterdam, Bryant, Golva, Omio, Peritsa and Sen series.  Amsterdam soils contain substantial amounts of volcanic glass shards and are in intermountain valleys.  Bryant soils formed entirely in glacial drift and contain more sand in the upper part of the solum.  Golva soils do not have glacial till 2C horizons.  Omio and Sen soils have soft siltstone bedrock within depths of 40 inches.  Peritsa soils contain carbonates within depths of 14 inches and have hue of 5YR or redder throughout the soil."

They have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick and contain less than 18 percent clay throughout the series control section.  Williams soils are on adjacent glacial till plains and are typically on higher lying parts of the landscape.  They are fine-loamy and have argillic horizons."
