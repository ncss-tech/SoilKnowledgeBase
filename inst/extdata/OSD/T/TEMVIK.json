  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The silty loess material is 20 to 40 inches thick over the underlying glacial till.  The silty loess material contains between 18 and about 28 percent clay.  The soil ranges from neutral in the upper horizons to moderately alkaline in the lower horizons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam, loam or clay loam and contains between 10 and 30 percent very fine sand.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam, loam or clay loam and contains between 10 and 30 percent very fine sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon that formed in the underlying glacial till.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has few to many masses of carbonates and contains from 4 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Some pedons have 2BCk horizons.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon that formed in the silty loess material.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam glacial till containing 2 to 8 percent coarse fragments.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Soft bedded sandstone, siltstone or shale is below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amsterdam, Bryant, Golva, Omio, Peritsa and Sen series.  Amsterdam soils contain substantial amounts of volcanic glass shards and are in intermountain valleys.  Bryant soils formed entirely in glacial drift and contain more sand in the upper part of the solum.  Golva soils do not have glacial till 2C horizons.  Omio and Sen soils have soft siltstone bedrock within depths of 40 inches.  Peritsa soils contain carbonates within depths of 14 inches and have hue of 5YR or redder throughout the soil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Temvik soils are on level to rolling upland plains.   Slopes are dominantly smooth plane or convex.  Slope gradients typically are 0 to 5 percent but range to 15 percent.  The soil formed in a silty loess mantle overlying loam or clay loam glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 18 inches."

They have mollic epipedons commonly 24 inches or more thick.  Linton soils occur where the silty loess deposits are more than 40 inches thick.  They are coarse-silty.  Mandan soils are in swales.  They have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick and contain less than 18 percent clay throughout the series control section.  Williams soils are on adjacent glacial till plains and are typically on higher lying parts of the landscape.  They are fine-loamy and have argillic horizons."
