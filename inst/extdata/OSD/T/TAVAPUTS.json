  "OVERVIEW": "The Tavaputs series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash, colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite and shale.  Tavaputs soils are on benches, hillslopes and mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.6 degrees C.",
