  "OVERVIEW": "The Tecomar series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Tecomar soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
