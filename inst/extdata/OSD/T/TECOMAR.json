These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,570 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
