These soils formed in loess, weathered sandstone, and schist with minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,100 to 4,200 feet.  The soils are in a climate of warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is 27 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 69 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 145 days."
