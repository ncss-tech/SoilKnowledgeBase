  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Toluca soils are usually dry when not frozen unless irrigated.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The average summer soil temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The average organic matter content of the upper 15 inches is 1 to 2 percent.   The noncalcareous part of the solum is 6 to 9 inches thick and depth to the Cca horizon is 8 to 11 inches.  Under deep cultivation the usual horizon sequence is Ap of clay loam, Cca and C horizons of loam texture; and in many pedons there is a light clay loam Bca horizon 2 to 4 inches thick beneath the Ap horizon.  The A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 through 4.  It contains 30 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 40 percent fine or coarser sand.  The Cca horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam to light clay loam with 20 to 40 percent fine and medium or coarser sand.  It has a CaC03 equivalent of 20 to 30 percent.  The substratum may be of very gravelly fine earths or of bedrock below 40 inches."

Cushman soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Fort Collins soils are noncalcareous to depths of 10 inches or more.  Fruita, Mack, Mesa, and Orchard soils have calcareous sola and average less than 1 percent organic matter in the upper 15 inches.  Keiser soils have less than 15 percent fine or coarser sands in the control section. Stoneham soils do not have calcic horizons."

The climate is cool semiarid with mean annual temperature of 47 degrees F. and mean summer temperature of about 67 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches."
