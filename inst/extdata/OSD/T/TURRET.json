  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Turret soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the loamy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the IIC horizon, but grades to 35 to 75 percent above depth of 50 inches. Rock fragments are typically less than 3 inches in diameter.  The solum and C horizon range from slightly acid to slightly alkaline\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is usually gravelly sandy clay loam but clay averages 18 to 35 percent, silt 5 to 30 percent, and sand 42 to 75 percent.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction ."

Assinniboine Evanston, Joplin, Kevin, Morval, Telstad and Villa Grove soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and C horizon, have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in their C horizons Bostwick soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the B2t horizon contain 2 to 20 percent mica platelets and have more than 18 percent clay and less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the C horizon.  Cheesman, Duffson, and Marmarth soils have bedrock above depth of 40 inches.  Jarre soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Perrypark soils have hue of 5YR or redder and contain large amounts of medium and coarse angular sand.  Peyton soils have a large proportion of medium and coarse angular sand, have \"hard setting\" properties when dry and have C horizons with less than 35 percent coarse fragments"
