Particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction throughout the profile is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist from 1 through 4.  Texture commonly is silt loam, but ranges to include fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue from 2.5YR through 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3, and chroma moist from 1 through 3.  Texture commonly is silt loam, but ranges to include fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue from 2.5YR through 10YR, value moist from 3 through 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 6.  Texture commonly is silt loam or gravelly silt loam, but ranges to include fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR; value moist from 3 through 6; and chroma moist from 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 25 percent."
