  "OVERVIEW": "The Thowson series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over ablation glacial till.  Thowson soils are on uplands and mountainsides on all aspects. Slopes range from 0 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent including 10 to 40 percent pumice 2mm to 10mm in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  It contains 5 to 35 percent pumice 2mm to 10mm in diameter.  Depth of the 3C horizon is 40 to 80 inches.  Some pedons have a stony surface.  Some pedons have dense glacial till below the 3C horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  This horizon is lacking in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.  Texture is ashy fine sandy loam, paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, ashy sandy loam, paragravelly ashy sandy loam, paragravelly ashy coarse sandy loam. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume. Pumice from 2mm to 10mm in diameter range from 5 to 40 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Textures are very cobbly loamy sand, very gravelly sandy loam, very stony fine sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 75 percent by volume.  Pumice 2mm to 10mm in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."
