    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tohona soils are on dipslopes of cuestas, summits of structural benches, and footslopes below mesas. They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Jurassic bentonitic shale, claystone, and sandstone. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 5,550 feet (1,402 to 1,692 meters). The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 mm); with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 52 to 58 degrees F (11 to 14 degrees C);. The average frost-free period is 130 to 180 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 1 inch (3 cm); (A horizon)\nNatric horizon - The zone from 1 to about 16 inches (3 to 41 cm); (Btn and Btkn horizons)\nGypsic horizon - The zone from 28 to about 38 inches (71 to 97 cm);  (By and 2BCy horizons)\nParalithic contact - The presence of soft shale bedrock at about 38 inches (97 mm)\nVertic features: The presence of cracks from 1 to 4 inches and a linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between the soil surface and a paralithic contact. (Btn and Btkn horizons)\nThe classification was changed from fine-silty, mixed, mesic Cambic Gypsiorthids to fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Natrargids in 1992.\nThe classification was changed from fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Natrargids to fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrargids in February 1997.\nThe classification was changed from fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrargids to fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrigypsids in June 2004.\nThe classification was changed from fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrigypsids to fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Natrigypsids in January 2005.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples were taken of the Btn and Btkn horizons at the series type location. Analysis for determination of sodium adsorption ratio was performed at the BIA soils lab in Gallup, NM as sample S88NM-045-4. The results confirm the moderately sodic Sodicity class. Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter. Salinity values were determined with an Instant EC Salinity kit.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy 11th Edition, 2010.\nRevised for the correlation the SDJR - MLRA 35 - Tohona-Kimnoli-Claysprings complex, 2 to 45 percent slopes project, September 2013, LJG2\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
