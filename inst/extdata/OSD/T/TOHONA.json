  "OVERVIEW": "The Tohona series consists of well drained, slowly permeable, sodic soils which are moderately deep to soft bedrock. Tohona soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from shale, claystone, and sandstone. These soils occur on dipslopes of cuestas, summits of structural benches, and footslopes below mesas. Slopes are 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches (178 mm); and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C).",

(Btn and Btkn horizons)\nThe classification was changed from fine-silty, mixed, mesic Cambic Gypsiorthids to fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Natrargids in 1992.\nThe classification was changed from fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Natrargids to fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrargids in February 1997.\nThe classification was changed from fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrargids to fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrigypsids in June 2004.\nThe classification was changed from fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrigypsids to fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Natrigypsids in January 2005.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples were taken of the Btn and Btkn horizons at the series type location. Analysis for determination of sodium adsorption ratio was performed at the BIA soils lab in Gallup, NM as sample S88NM-045-4. The results confirm the moderately sodic Sodicity class. Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter. Salinity values were determined with an Instant EC Salinity kit.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy 11th Edition, 2010.\nRevised for the correlation the SDJR - MLRA 35 - Tohona-Kimnoli-Claysprings complex, 2 to 45 percent slopes project, September 2013, LJG2\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
