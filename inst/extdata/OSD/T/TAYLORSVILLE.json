  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 7 to 24 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F., and the average summer temperature ranges from 69 to 71 degrees F. The soils are mildly to strongly alkaline and moderately to strongly calcareous.\nThe A horizon has value of 5.5 or 6 dry, 3.5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly hard to very hard, slightly sticky to sticky, and slightly plastic to plastic.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Where mottled, chroma is 3 or more.  Mottles may occur at some depth below 24 inches in thin lenses of sandy materials. The calcic horizon contains 18 to 40 percent calcium carbonate. The 10 to 40 inch section ranges from silt loam to clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Below 40 inches textures range from silty clay to sandy loam and are typically laminated, calcareous lacustrine sediments with marked vertical jointing."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Taylorsville soils are on nearly level to moderately steep, intermediate, and low lake terraces with slopes of 0 to 15 percent at elevations of 4,500 to 4,900 feet. They formed in calcareous, mixed lacustrine sediments derived mainly from limestone and shale. The climate is dry subhumid having a mean annual temperature of 49 to 52 degrees F., an average summer temperature of 70 degrees F., and average annual precipitation of 14 to 16 inches. The frost-free period is 130 to 170 days."

McMurdie soils have Bt horizons containing more than 35 percent clay. Vineyard and Welby soils have mollic epipedons and have less than 18 percent clay in their control sections. Vineyard soils also have mottles at some depth between 20 and 40 inches."
