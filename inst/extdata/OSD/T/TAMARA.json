  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tamara soils occur on dissected basalt plateaus, canyons,  and back slopes of mountains. Elevations are 2,800 to 5,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The soil is formed in a mantle of volcanic ash overlying material derived from a mixture of loess and colluvium and residuum from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches but can range to 16 inches on north-facing slopes. The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
