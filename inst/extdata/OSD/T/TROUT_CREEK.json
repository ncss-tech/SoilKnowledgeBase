  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 8 to 30 inches and is not shallower than the upper 3 inches of the B2t horizon.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 12 to 37 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to about 5 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock.  These are mainly 1/2 to 5 inches in diameter. Hue is extremely variable, ranging from 5Y through 10R between subhorizons, between portions of subhorizons, and between pedons. The colors are inherited from the parent rocks and the variability of the coloration within and between adjacent pedons is considered to be typical and definitive for the series.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10R, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or light clay but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 20 to 55 percent, and sand from 5 to 40 percent with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe Clca horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 10R.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye) and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate in the fine earth fraction."

Arling, Brinkert, Buckskin, Heath, Gothic, of less than 40 inches.  Brolliar, Getta, Judy, Little Horn, and Youman soils have lithic contacts at depths of less than 40 inches.

The soil formed in moderately thin, calcareous multicolored parent materials derived from reddish brown, gray, and yellow Pennsylvanian and similar sedimentary beds.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 58 degrees F."
