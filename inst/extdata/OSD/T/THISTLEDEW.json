  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Thistledew series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a sandy mantle of outwash or beach deposits and underlying loamy and clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. They are on outwash terraces, deltas and beaches on glacial lake plains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is rapid in the upper part and very slow in the lower part. Slopes are 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates is 26 to 52 inches. The sandy mantle is 20 to 36 inches thick. The loamy sediment is 3 to 18 inches thick. The clayey substratum begins at depths of less than 40 inches. Typically pedons do not have rock fragments, but some have as much as 3 percent gravel within the sandy or loamy sediments or both. The clayey sediments commonly have 60 to 75 percent clay in at least the upper part. Reaction in the solum is strongly acid to slightly acid in material 1, moderately acid to neutral in material 2, and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in material 3. The 3C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have an A horizon as much as 3 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and E horizons are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Hue of 7.5YR is principally in the upper part of the horizon. It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, or loamy coarse sand. Some pedons have thin E/B horizons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has typical hue of 10YR, but in some pedons it has hue of 2.5Y principally in the lower part. It has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Fe depletions occur within the upper 10 inches. In some pedons lower subhorizons have dominant chroma of 2. It is mainly sandy clay loam or loam, but thin subhorizons of sandy loam or coarse sandy loam are in the upper part.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay or silty clay.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 3, dominantly 2. It is mainly clay or silty clay, but some pedons have thin coarser textured strata. Some pedons have soft rounded carbonate masses. A few pedons have small rounded carbonate concretions or limestone pebbles."
