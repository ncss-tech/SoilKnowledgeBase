  "OVERVIEW": "The Truckee series consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Truckee soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
