  "OVERVIEW": "The Timberhead series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt mixed with volcanic ash. Timberhead soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section is usually moist, but is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10. The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 98 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent. On a weighted average, the particle-size control section has 20 to 35 percent basalt rock fragments and 10 to 18 percent apparent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. It has 20 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6 dry. It has 20 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has chroma of 6 to 8 dry.
