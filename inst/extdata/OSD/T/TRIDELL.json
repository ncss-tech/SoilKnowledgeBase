  "OVERVIEW": "The Tridell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, shale and quartzite.  Tridell soils are on fan remnants and hills.  Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
