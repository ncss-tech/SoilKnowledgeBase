  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonkey series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy glaciofluvial deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, or glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",
