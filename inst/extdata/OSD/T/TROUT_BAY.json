  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 41 to 130 centimeters. Woody fragments ranging in size from 2mm to 6 centimeters in diameter are at random throughout the control section and comprise 5 to 15 percent of the volume in some pedons. The surface and subsurface tier has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. The reaction in the organic portion of the control section is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe surface tier is dominantly sapric material with an unrubbed fiber content that ranges from 5 to 25 percent, and a rubbed fiber content of less than 5 percent. The structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular. In some pedons the upper 8 centimeters of the surface tier is mucky peat.\nThe subsurface tier is sapric material with an unrubbed fiber content of 5 to 15 percent, and a rubbed fiber content of less than 5. The structure is weak medium or coarse subangular blocky.\nThe bottom tier, where present, has fiber content similar to the subsurface tier. The structure is dominantly massive.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sand or coarse sand."

Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C."

The somewhat excessively drained Shingleton, well drained Deerton, somewhat poorly drained Jeske and the poorly drained Gongeau soils form a drainage catena with the Trout Bay soils. The moderately well drained Munising and Yalmer soils are on adjacent ground moraines and are very deep to bedrock."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the organic tiers, moderately high in the Cr horizon and very low in the bedrock. The depth to the perched wet soil moisture status is from the surface to 30 centimeters below the surface during the period from January to December."
