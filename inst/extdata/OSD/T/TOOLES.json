    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to limestone is 41 to 60 inches.  Reaction in the A and E horizons ranges from very strongly acid to neutral and neutral to moderately alkaline in the Btg horizons.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is muck.  Where present, this horizon is less than 6 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Few to common redoximorphic features in shades of brown and gray are in most pedons.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It has similar texture and reaction as the E horizon, but sand grains are coated and contain slightly more total silt and clay.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Most pedons have common to many redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is composed of soft, highly weathered limestone that is easily penetrated by roots and can be dug without difficulty.  It usually contains soft carbonate accumulations along with few to many hard limestone or chert fragments.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is composed of soft, weathered, fractured limestone that can be dug with difficulty with a spade, has very firm to extremely firm rupture resistance with low to high excavation difficulty.  It usually contains soft carbonate accumulations along with few to many hard limestone or chert fragments.  It is highly irregular and interspersed with solution holes that range from 4 to 12 inches in diameter and filled with sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil material.  Depth to limestone is variable within short distances.\nThe R horizon is composed of hard, unweathered limestone that has slightly rigid to very rigid rupture resistance with very high to extremely excavation difficulty.  Some areas contain solution holes filled with Btg and/or Cr material."

Bayvi soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on broad flat tidal marsh areas.  Chaires and Leon soils have spodic horizons.  Also, Leon soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Nutall and Wekiva soils have less than 20 inches of sandy epipedon.  Shired soils have a mollic epipedon and have an argillic horizon at a depth of more than 40 inches.  Surrency soils have low base saturation and have an argillic horizon at a depth of more than 40 inches.  Tennille soils are shallow to limestone and do not have an argillic horizon."
