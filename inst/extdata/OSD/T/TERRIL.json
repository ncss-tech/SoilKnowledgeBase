  "STATES": "IL,IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Terril series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium. These soils are on base slopes, foot slopes, drainageways, swales and toe slopes on alluvial fans, and treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 875 millimeters.",
