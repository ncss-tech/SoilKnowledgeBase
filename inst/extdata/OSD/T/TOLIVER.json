  "OVERVIEW": "The Toliver series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy-skeletal colluvium derived from sandstone.  Toliver soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 50 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
