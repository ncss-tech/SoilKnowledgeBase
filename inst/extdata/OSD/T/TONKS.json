  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonks series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed, stratified alluvium.  Tonks soils are on low alluvial fans and bottomlands and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual  air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated and have a temporary water table during spring and nd early summer unless they have been artifically drained.  The fluctuating water table is at depths of about 30 to 50 inches during these periods and when heavily irrigated.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 41 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is about 53 to 55 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe IC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Mottles range from few to many and from faint to prominent.  Carbonate content ranges from about 7 to 15 percent and the reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Stratified thin layers of variable textures are common below depth of about 24 inches."

The soils formed in mixed, stratified alluvium derived from a variety of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  The soils are in a cool subhumid continental climate with annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 50 to 80 days."
