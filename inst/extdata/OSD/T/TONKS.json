  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated and have a temporary water table during spring and nd early summer unless they have been artifically drained.  The fluctuating water table is at depths of about 30 to 50 inches during these periods and when heavily irrigated.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 41 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is about 53 to 55 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe IC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Mottles range from few to many and from faint to prominent.  Carbonate content ranges from about 7 to 15 percent and the reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Stratified thin layers of variable textures are common below depth of about 24 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Foxcreek, Furniss, and Moslander (t) series.  Foxcreek soils are moderately deep to sand and gravel and lack carbonate accumulation.  Furniss soils are poorly drained and are noncalcareous.  Moslander soils lack distinct and continuous concentrated horizons of secondary calcium carbonate above depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tonks soils are on level to very gently sloping alluvial fans and bottomlands.  Elevations range from about 5,500 to 7,000 feet.  The soils formed in mixed, stratified alluvium derived from a variety of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  The soils are in a cool subhumid continental climate with annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 50 to 80 days."
