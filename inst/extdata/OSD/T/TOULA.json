  "OVERVIEW": "The Toula series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that have a fragipan.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the subsoil and slow in the fragipan.  They formed in a moderately thick mantle of loess over loamy Coastal Plain sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Depth to redoximorphic depletions having chroma of 2 or less is typically greater than 20 inches, but ranges from 17 to 30 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid throughout the solum, except in areas that have been limed.  The effective cation exchange capacity of the soil is 20 to 70 percent saturated with exchangeable aluminum to a depth of 30 inches or more.  Content of total sand in the particle size control section (Bt horizon) typically is less than 15 percent, but it ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  Less than 15 percent of the sand in the particle size control section is fine sand or coarser.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Where the color value is 3, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown range from few to many.  Iron depletions in shades of gray, below a depth of 16 inches, are present in some pedons. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx and 2Btx horizons have the same colors as the Bt horizon. Redoximorphic features in shades of red, yellow, brown and gray range from common to many; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in these shades. The fragipan has gray vertical seams that form a roughly polygonal pattern of prisms. The matrix of the prisms is very firm and brittle when moist and in the major part of the fragipan and it constitutes more than 60 percent of the volume. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the Btx horizon and silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the 2Btx horizon. Content of total sand in the 2Btx horizon ranges from 15 to 30 percent. Clay content in the fragipan ranges from 18 to 35 percent.\nThe 2B't horizon has the same colors and texture as the 2Btx horizon.  Brittle bodies are none or few."
