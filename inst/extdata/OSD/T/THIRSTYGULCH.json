The soil formed in a small amount of volcanic ash mixed with loess and colluvium from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
