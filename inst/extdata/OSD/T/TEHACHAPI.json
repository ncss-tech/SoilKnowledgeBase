  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between the depths of 10 and 16 inches is moist in some or all parts from November until late May. Mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 66 degrees F. The solum contains 0 to 35 percent by volume rock fragments, 2mm to 24 inches in size, with up to 20 percent of those as cobbles and stones in some pedons. Reaction is slightly acid through moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark brown, dark gray, dark grayish brown or brown (10YR 3/2 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3); brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4); or reddish brown (5YR 4/3). It is sandy loam, loam or cobbly sandy clay loam. Organic matter content is more than 1 percent to a depth of 10 to 19 inches. Where cultivated, the surface has been mixed to form an Ap horizon about 9 inches thick. Colors are dark grayish brown or brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3).\nA transitional A3 horizon or B1 is present in most pedons, or the horizon boundary is clear or irregular.\nThe B2t horizon is reddish yellow, light brown or brown (7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/2); yellowish red, light reddish brown or reddish brown (5YR 5/6, 6/4, 5/4, 4/4, 4/6). It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or cobbly sandy clay, and averages 25 to 35 percent clay. Few fine filaments of lime occur in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe C horizon is yellow, brownish yellow, yellowish brown, reddish yellow light brown, brown, yellowish red, reddish brown or reddish gray (10YR 7/6, 6/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/4, 4/4; 5YR 6/6, 5/6, 5/4, 5/2).  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or sandy clay, or gravelly or cobbly equivalents of each. Gravel and cobble content ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Thin lime-silica lamellae occur in some pedons but are below depth of 40 inches. These lamellae are weakly cemented and not continuous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ballard, Chualar, Gilroy, Havala, Pinto and Soper series. Ballard soils have a weakly developed Bt horizon with is to 25 percent clay and less than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand. Chualar soils have a moderately developed B2t horizon with 18 to 25 percent clay. Havala soils have dark A horizons more than 20 inches thick and have B2t horizons with dominantly 10YR and 2.5YR colors.  Gilroy and Soper soils are underlain by bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Pinto soils have a strongly developed B2t horizon with an abrupt A/B horizon boundary."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tehachapi soils are formed on old stream terraces and alluvial fans from mixed alluvium. Gradients are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,000 to 4,300 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches some as snow. Average January temperature is 39 degrees to 47 degrees F., average July temperature is 72 degrees to 82 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 64 degrees F. Freeze-free season is about 150 to 275 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Havala soils and the Arvin, Chanac, Pleito and Warong soils. Arvin, Chanac and Pleito soils lack an argillic horizon. Also, Arvin soils are coarse-loamy and Pleito soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches. Walong soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, lack an argillic horizon and are coarse-loamy. They occur on the adjacent uplands."
