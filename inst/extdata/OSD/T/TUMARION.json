Bylas soils are moist for more than 20 cumulative days during July-September.  Cline soils are intermittently moist for more than 20 days between July to October.  Crosgrain soils have a duripan which extends to greater than 60 inches.  Gotchell soils are shallow to consolidated fanglomerate and average less than 18 percent clay. Greyeagle soils do not have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches. Longjim soils contain less than 10 percent clay and do not have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Marsite soils contain less than 12 percent clay and do not have appreciable precipitation in the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tumarion soils are on mesas and plateaus at elevations of 2,200 to 5,000 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from basalt, andesite, tuff and volcanic breccia.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 40 percent. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 250 days."
