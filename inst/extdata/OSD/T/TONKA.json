  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates commonly is 28 to 40 inches but ranges from 20 to more than 60 inches.  The depth to the Bt horizon ranges from 12 to 28 inches.  The soil commonly is free of rock fragments, but in some pedons the lower part of the solum and the substratum contain pebbles.  Some pedons have surface stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.  The E horizon extends into the Bt horizon in many profiles and bleached sand and silt grains coat faces of peds in the Bt horizon.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has is a wide range in amount and distinctness of redoximorphic features.  The Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay averaging between 35 and 45 percent clay.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have Bk, Bg, BC, 2Bk or 2BC horizons below the Bt horizon that may or may not be gleyed.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 6 and 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It typically is silty clay loam, clay loam or loam, but textures of silty clay, clay, silt loam or sandy clay loam are allowed.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The C horizon is not gleyed in some pedons.  Textures ranging from loamy fine sand to clay are allowed below a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tonka soils are in plane or slightly concave, closed basins and depressions on till and glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in local alluvium over till or glaciolacustrine deposits.  The mean annual air temperature is about 37 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 12 to 24 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barnes, Forman, Hamerly, Max, Parnell, Svea and Williams soils.  Barnes, Forman, Hamerly, Max, Svea and Williams soils are on higher lying positions.  These soils are well to somewhat poorly drained, and do not have albic horizons or low chroma redoximorphic features in the argillic horizon.  In addition, Hamerly soils have a calcic horizon at depths of less than 16 inches.  Parnell soils are in deeper and commonly larger depressions.  They do not have albic horizons and are very poorly drained."
