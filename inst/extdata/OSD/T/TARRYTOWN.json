  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 12 to 20 inches.  The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline throughout the solum and mildly to strongly alkaline in the C horizons.  Boulders ranging in size from 10 inches to about 4 feet occur on the surface and in the solum.  They occupy about 0.01 percent of the surface and solum and are estimated to occur at 150 to 200 foot intervals.  Cobbles are on and within the soil at about the same percentage rate as the boulders.  The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  If value is 3 and chroma is 2, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  The texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 5, or value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 to 8, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4.  Few to common mottles in shades of brown and yellow are in most pedons.  The texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have thin horizons of sandy clay.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8 and chroma of 1 or 2.  In some pedons the upper part is mixed low and high chroma colors in hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Few to common mottles in shades of yellow are in some pedons. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has mixed colors in hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

This soil  lacks low chroma mottles in the argillic horizon, but due to a high water table its behavior is like that of the Aquic subgroup.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
