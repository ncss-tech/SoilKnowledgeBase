  "OVERVIEW": "The Telogia series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments that weathered from limestone.  They are on lower slopes of uplands of limestone outcrops of the Hawthorn Formation in the Southern Coastal Plain of the Florida panhandle.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

The well drained Chickasaw are more acid and are underlain by sandstone and claystone.  The moderately well drained Colbert soils are underlain by argillaceous limestone and shale are in the southern Appalachian limestone ridges and valleys.  The moderately well drained Etoile soils and well drained Kellison soils are underlain by tertiary age shale of the Cook Mountain Geologic Formation in Texas.  The well drained Iota soils are very deep and are on stream terraces.  The moderately well drained Oakhurst soils are very deep to unconsolidated volcanic tuffaceous material that overlies siltstone and sandstone strata.  The well drained Oula soils are very deep and in the tertiary age Catahoula Formation.  The moderately well drained Rayburn soils formed in acid tuffaceous sandstone.  The well drained Woodtell soils formed in Eocene Age shale in the Wilcox and Cook Mountain Formations in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana."

The well drained Bonifay soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick and have plinthite in the subsoil.  The well drained and moderately well drained Cowarts soils have fine-loamy control sections.  The well drained Dothan soils have fine-loamy control sections and are Plinthic.  The well drained Fuquay soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick, have loamy control sections, and are Plinthic.  The well drained Hardin Heights soils are shallow to limestone.  The moderately well drained Nankin soils have less clay in the control section.  The well drained Orangeburg soils have fine-loamy control sections."
