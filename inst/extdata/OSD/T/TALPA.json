  "OVERVIEW": "The Talpa series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum derived mainly from dolomitic limestone of the Blaine formation of Permian age. These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on interfluves and side slopes of hills and ridges on dissected plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
