  "OVERVIEW": "The Tidehaven series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on coastal prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1145 mm (49 in).",
