  "OVERVIEW": "The Tillmont series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over colluvium and residuum from schist or gneiss.  Tillmont soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The upper part of the 1 to 41 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water content of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The lower part is considered to be loamy-skeletal.  Depth to schist or gneiss bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is paragravelly ashy sandy loam, or very paragravelly ashy sandy loam.  It is 20 to 55 percent pumice.\nThe 2C1 horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 8 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, and 4 through 6 dry,  It is 65 to 95 percent pumice and voids are not filled.\nThe 3C2 horizon is very paragravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, paragravelly ashy loamy coarse sand or paragravelly ashy very coarse sand.  It is 15 to 60 percent pumice.\nThe 4C3 horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly very fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 45 to 90 percent."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 6 inches, a cambic horizon from 7 to 21 inches, and a particle-size control section with weight average 27 percent pumice from 1 to 21 inches, 95 percent pumice with voids not filled from 21 to 35 inches, 15 percent pumice from 35 to 39 inches and 75 percent rock fragments from 39 to 41 inches.  The layer from 39 to 41 inches is considered to be loamy-skeletal and isotic.  The contrasting family pumiceous or ashy-pumiceous over loamy-skeletal is not approved.  The best series placement is to consider the loamy-skeletal layer as medial-skeletal for classification purposes."
