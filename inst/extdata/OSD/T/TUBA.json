Kawich and Sundown soils have a lithologic discontinuity at depths of 40 to 120 inches (100 to 300 cm). Tipper soils have paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 cm).

Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in eolian sands derived from sandstone and siltstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.0 to 14.0 degrees Celsius).  The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."
