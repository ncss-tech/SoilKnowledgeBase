  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuba series consists of deep and very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands derived from sandstone.  Tuba soils are on dunes, plateaus, and sand sheets.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
