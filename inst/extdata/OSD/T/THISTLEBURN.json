The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist and is dry between 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The upper square meter of the mineral soil contains 12 to 18 kilograms of organic carbon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  The structure is moderate or strong and very fine, fine or medium.  Consistency is slightly hard or hard, friable or firm, slightly sticky to very sticky and slightly plastic or plastic.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  It has 4 to 8 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry.  The texture is silty clay or clay with 40 to 55 percent clay. Structure is fine, medium or coarse.  Consistence is hard or very hard, friable to very firm, sticky or very sticky and plastic or very plastic.   Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.  Base saturation by sum of bases is 15 to 35 percent throughout.  It has 0.5 to 3.0 percent organic matter decreasing with depth."
