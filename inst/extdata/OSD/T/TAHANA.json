  "OVERVIEW": "The Tahana series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from granitic rocks and schist.  Tahana soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
