  "OVERVIEW": "The Tymosling series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Tymosling soils are on rolling plateaus.  Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
