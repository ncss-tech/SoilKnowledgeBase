  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunehill series consists of shallow, well drained soils on hillslopes of high elevation dissected terraces.  These soils formed in mixed consolidated alluvium derived dominantly from basic igneous rock.  Slope ranges from 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 15 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F in parts of January and February.  The soil between a depth of 8 inches and the paralithic contact is moist throughout from November 15 to May 15 and dry throughout from June 15 to October 15 most years.  In some pedons the mollic epipedon extends into the Bw horizon to the paralithic contact.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3; or 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 2.5Y 3/2.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Organic matter content ranges from 1 to 4 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, or 5/4.  It is loam or silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay content.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe consolidated volcanic sediments are stratified as to type of material and degree of hardness.  They are gravelly in some pedons."

Tunis soils have less than 18 percent clay content in the texture control section and are somewhat excessively drained. Bonnydoon and Caperton soils do not have a Bw horizon.  Calodo soils are calcareous.  Friant and Lodo soils have a lithic contact.  Illito soils have an argillic horizon."

These soils formed in mixed consolidated alluvium of the Peckham Formation derived dominantly from basic igneous rock of the Quien Sabe Formation.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 200 to 230 days."

They are being differentiated by not having the clayey-skeletal texture control section and by not being greater than 60 inches deep as is typical of the Keefers series.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
