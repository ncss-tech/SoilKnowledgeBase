(Ap, A, and AC horizons)\nEndosaturation: In the Cr horizon, based on observations of saturation. The absence of redoximorphic features is presumed to be due to the sandy-skeletal substratum. Aquic conditions are not recognized in the upper 40 inches.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Ninth edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
