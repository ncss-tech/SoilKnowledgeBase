  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nFragments of petrified wood are common on the surface and within the solum.  In some places fragments of limestone occur in the profile.  Fragments and pieces of shale occur on the surface in places, and there are outcrops of shale.  This soil is generally calcareous to the surface.  The A1 horizon is noncalcareous in places but is not acid. The depth to fractured shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The color of the A1 horizon ranges from dark gray to reddish-brown to brown.  In the layers below the A1 horizon, the degree of redness varies, depending on the color of the parent shale.  The texture of the B2 horizon is generally clay, but in places it is silty clay or heavy clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Thurloni series consists of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained, calcareous soils on gently rolling or moderately steep uplands.  They formed in strongly calcareous, red, clayey shale of the Chinle formation. These soils occur at elevations of 6,000 to 7,000 feet, where the annual precipitation is 14 to 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Thurloni soils are associated with the Ordnance and Showlow soils.  They have been less influenced by sandstone than the Ordnance soils, and their horizonation is less distinct than that of those soils.  The Thurloni soils are shallower and more calcareous than the Showlow soils.  They are less well developed than those soils."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The vegetation consists mainly of pinyon pine and juniper, but there is some ponderosa pine, oak brush, mountain-mahogany, blue grama, western wheatgrass and squirreltail. Greasewood and shadscale grow in the drier areas. In many places the stands of pinyon and juniper are so dense that there is little other vegetation."
