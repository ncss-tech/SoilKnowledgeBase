  "OVERVIEW": "The Tucson series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in fan and stream alluvium.  Tucson soils are on relict basin floors, fan terraces or stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 75 degrees F.",
