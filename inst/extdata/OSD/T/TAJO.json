    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tajo soils are on fan terraces with slope gradients of 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  They formed in pyroclastics and basalt.  The climate is semiarid.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches and occurs mainly as summer thunderstorms and as rain and snow during the winter months.  The average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 120 to 160 days."
