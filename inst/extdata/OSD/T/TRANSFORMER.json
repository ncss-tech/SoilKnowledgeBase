Elevation ranges from 3,900 to 4,040 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls in all months as gentle winter storms and with increased amounts during high intensity summer storms.  The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."
