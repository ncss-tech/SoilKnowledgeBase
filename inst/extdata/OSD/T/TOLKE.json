  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for a period of less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The solum is more than 50 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The solum is weakly or moderately smeary and has a moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 to 6 dry.  This horizon is commonly silt loam but includes loam.  Concretions range from about 0 to 15 percent.  Soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 moist and 5 to 8 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and 6 to 8 dry. It is silty clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent apparent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.\nA few rock fragments from the underlying rock are embedded in the C horizons of some pedons.  The underlying rock is usually tuffaceous siltstone, but basalt is found below some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Anunde, Belle, Hemcross, Skamo, Wadell, and Zenger soils.  Hemcross, Skamo, Wadell, and Zenker soils have umbric epipedons.  Anunde soils have an apparent clay content of 18 to 27 percent in the Bw horizon above 40 inches.  Belle soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section, are formed in alluvium on low terraces and fans, and are subject to rare flooding.  Hencross, Skamo, Wadell, and Zenker soils have umbric epipedons.  In addition, Skamo soils have redox concentrations at a depth of 24 to 40 inches.  Wadell soils have 15 to 30 percent rounded gravel in the particle-size control section, and stratified 2C horizons.  Zenker soils have 20 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent sandstone paragravel in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tolke soils are on mountains in the Coast Range at elevations of 800 to 2,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent but are commonly less than 30 percent.  The soils formed in mixed colluvium weathered mostly from tuffaceous sedimentary rock. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean July temperature is 64 degrees F.; the mean winter temperature is 34 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The frost free period is 100 to 200 days."
