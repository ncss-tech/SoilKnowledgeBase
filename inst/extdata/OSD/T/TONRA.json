  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonra series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to sand and gravel. They formed in alluvium containing granite, limestone and quartzite gravel on valley floors and flood plains. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, mean summer temperature is greater than 59 degrees F. and mean winter temperature is 25 to 30 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 130 days.",
