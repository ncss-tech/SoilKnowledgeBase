    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, and to continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate, ranges from 20 to 31 inches.  The depth to a fragmental discontinuity is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 22-28, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.   The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Textures are loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay, and are modified by 5 to 25 percent porcelanite channers.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are very channery loam, very channery sandy clay loam, or very channery fine sandy loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 35 to 45 percent angular porcelanite channers and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Exchangeable sodium is commonly 5 to 15 percent, but may range to 25 percent where baked shale is sodic, or when clinker beds are present.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  It is typically moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, but may range to very strongly alkaline in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Matrix textures are loamy sand, sandy loam or loam and are modified by 55 to 70 percent porcelanite rock fragments, of which 40 to 60 percent are channers, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline."

Barx, Cerrillos, Clovis, Fernando, Hiland, Los Alamos, Millet, Progresso, Scholle, Tapia, Toluca, and Tuweep soils have calcic horizons.  Balon and Spenlo soils are noncalcareous to 35 inches or more.  Quagwa and Redpen soils have soil temperature greater than 51 degrees F., and do not contain channery porcelanite fragments.  Selpats soils do not have a discontinuity containing fragments of porcelanite.  Sundance soils have buried horizons at 10 to 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teckla soils are on structural fans, terraces, and on small mesas.  They formed in alluvium or loess over weathered porcelanite or very channery slopewash derived from porcelanite.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
