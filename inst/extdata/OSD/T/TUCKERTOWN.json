O horizons are dominantly sapric material but include hemic. Reaction ranges from ultra acid to extremely acid (pH 3.0 to 4.4 in 0.01 M CaCl2).\nSome Tuckertown soils are underlain by a mineral C horizon at a depth greater than 130 cm.  The C horizon value is 10YR, chroma is 4 or 5, and value is 1 to3.  Texture is commonly is loamy fine sand to coarse sand but also includes strata or varves of loamy textures."

Burlingame soils have materials finer than loamy fine sand within the particle size control section. Aquapaug soils are on lake bottoms and have sandy textures throughout the particle size control section."
