Blickenstaff soils have secondary carbonates at 30 to 40 inches and have a water table at 3.5 to 5 feet fron March through May.  The Blue Star soils lack cambic horizons and have weakly to strongly cemented Bk horizons. Courtrock soils lack cambic and calcic horizons. Era soils lack calcic horizons and have 10 to 25 percent pimice and less than 10 percent coarse fragments. Farrell soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 10 to 34 inches, lack calcic horizons above a depth of 40 inches. Malott soils have a duripan at 40 to 60 inches and lime at 23 to 43 inches."

They formed in mixed alluvium, from sedimentary rocks and quartzite and in beach deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period is 100 to 140 days."
