  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n1. Tangier soils were previously mapped as tidal marsh, formerly a miscellaneous area.\n2. Some pedons have sulfides in the epipedon and upper solum.\n3. These soils become extremely acid when drained.\n4. The original structure of the argillic horizon has been destroyed because of dispersion due to salts.\n5. High salt content--the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 10 to 16 mmhos/cm in the mineral horizons to greater than 16 mmhos/cm in the organic zone\n6. Salinity of the water--ranges from 8 to 16 parts per thousand (ppt).\n7. Tangier is named for Tangier Sound, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 13 to 18 centimeters (4 to 7 inches) (Ag and Eg horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 142 centimeters (7 to 56 inches) (Btg and BCg horizons)\nAquic conditions--within the upper 50 centimeters (20 inches) the soil is continuously or periodically saturated\nMLRA = 153D\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available from KSSL, Pedon number S00MD-039-001. Radiocarbon data results of organic material taken from this pedon on file at the Somerset County, Maryland, field office.   Additional reference samples include Site Numbers 35 and 36 from Darmody, R.G. 1975.  Reconnaissance survey of the tidal marsh soils of Maryland.  M.S. Thesis, Univ. of Maryland, College Park.  181p. Refer to publication Tidal Marsh Soils of Maryland, Darmody, R.G., and Foss, J.E., Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station, Number MP 930, October 1978.\nData Map Unit ID: 438202\nRevised: 1/2003-SYD, PSK; 11/2006-SYD, DHK; 6/2013-DTA, Established.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
