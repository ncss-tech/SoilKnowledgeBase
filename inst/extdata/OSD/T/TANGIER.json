    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nTangier soils were previously mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas.\nSome pedons have sulfides in the epipedon and upper solum.\nTangier soils can become extremely acid to strongly acid when drained, depending on sulfide content.\nThe original structure of the argillic horizon has been destroyed because of dispersion from salts.\nSalinity of the water--ranges from 8 to 16 parts per thousand (ppt).\nTangier soils are classified as Alfisols due to elevated base saturation (35 percent or greater) in the subsoil resulting from infiltration with base-rich saline water.\nTangier is named for Tangier Sound, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (Oese, Aseg, and Eseg horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 58 centimeters (Btg horizons)\nAquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)\nHemic soil materials--the zone from 0 to 10 centimeters (Oese horizon)\nLithologic discontinuity--58 to 200 centimeters\nParticle size control section--18 to 58 centimeters (argillic horizon)\nHydrogen Sulfide Odor--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters"
