  "OVERVIEW": "The Topeman series consists of deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in slopewash alluvium and residuum on bedrock-controlled fan aprons and toeslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Shale platelets range from 10 to 35 percent in the control section and are soft, breaking down upon pretreatment.  The control section is silty clay or clay and has 45 to 60 percent clay.  Salinity usually ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos but in some wet areas ranges up to 16 mmhos.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.  This horizon is acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  The upper part of the C horizon is clay and the lower part is clay or silty clay.  Threads and seams of calcium sulfate range from few to many and are inherent to the parent sediments.  Local movement does occur in pedons in some horizons."
