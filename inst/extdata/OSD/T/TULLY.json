  "OVERVIEW": "The Tully series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in  colluvium.  Tully soils are on footslopes of hillslopes of uplands in Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters (35 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
