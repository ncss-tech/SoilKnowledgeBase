  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to indurated petrocalcic horizon ranges from 8 to 14 inches.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 25 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Content of rock fragments range less than 35 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bkm horizon is composed of indurated petrocalcic material.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 8, and chroma of 3.  It can not be excavated with hand tools, but is rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Content of rock fragment range from 25 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of soft limestone bedrock.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment."

Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  They formed in material that weathered from limestone bedrock.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 38 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 77 to 81 degrees F."

All of these soils with the exception of La Covana (T) series are on similar positions but do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  La Covana (T) series have a calcic horizon, do not have a paralithic contact below the petrocalcic horizon within a depth of 60 inches, and is in the clayey skeletal family."
