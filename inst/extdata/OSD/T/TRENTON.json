  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Trenton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite.  The Trenton soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains, and lake terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Trenton soils occur on smooth to strongly undulating, nearly level to steep alluvial flats, lake plains, and lake terraces. Dominant slopes are 0 to 3 percent, but slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils have formed in fine textured lacustrine sediments derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite, but include materials from many other kinds of rock. The climate is dry subhumid; winters are cold and summers warm.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F., the average summer temperature from 65 to 72 degrees F., and the freeze-free season from 120 to 160 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  Elevation is 4200 to 4800 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: The zone from the surface to 15 inches. (Ap and Btn horizons)\nNatric horizon: The zone from 8 to 60 inches. (Btn, Btnk1, Btnk2, and Btnk3 horizons)\nThe classification is based on \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\".\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class is based on NSSL data.  Additional investigation is needed to determine if the Trenton series should be in the Vertic subgroup.  There are 2 chroma mottles in the 26 to 34 inch layer, however, the saturation is at 30 inches or deeper so the soil doesn't meet the aquic subgroup criteria.  Depth to aquic conditions also needs additional investigation for classification and drainage class assignment.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
