  "OVERVIEW": "The Tsadaka series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of volcanic ash-influenced loess overlying friable to firm glacial till.  Tsadaka soils are on hummocks on the backslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 33 degrees F.",

Horizons are broken and discontinuous.  A buried sequa occurs in some pedons.  The upper 4 inches of the combined spodic horizons have more than 6 percent organic carbon.  The upper part of the control section formed in loess dominated by amorphous material.  The lower part of the spodic horizon is firm or very firm and weakly to strongly cemented.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value moist of 2 or 3, and chroma moist from 1 through 3.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue from 10R to 5YR, value moist of 2 or 3, and chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue from 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value moist of 2 through 4, and chroma moist of 4 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bsm or 2Bhsm horizon has hue from 10R through 5YR, value moist from 2 through 4, and moist chroma from 2 through 6.  These horizons are weakly to strongly cemented.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 25 to 50 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobble.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue from 10YR through 5Y, moist value from 3 through 5, and moist chroma from 1 through 3.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 30 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobble.  Texture is loam or sandy loam."
