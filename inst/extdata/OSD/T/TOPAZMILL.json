  "OVERVIEW": "The Topazmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foot slopes and hill sides of uplands. They formed in loamy slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
