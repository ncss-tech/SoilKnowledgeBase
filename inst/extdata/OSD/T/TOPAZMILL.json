Cottonbend, Fanchon, Taterhill, and Wyrick soils have more silt and less sand in the particle-size control section. Egyptgrove soils have a Btd horizon. McClung and Trimble sois do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Nolichucky soils have rounded sandstone and quartzite fragments in the series control section."

Elevations are commonly 550 to 1,200 feet. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Relfe soils are sandy-skeletal. Sandbur soils are coarse-loamy. Both of these soils are on floodplains. Yelton soils have a fragpan and are on similar landscape positions. Zanoni soils are coarse-loamy and are on stream terraces."
