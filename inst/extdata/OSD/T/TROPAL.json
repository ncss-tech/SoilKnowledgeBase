  "REVDATE": "09/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tropal series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from limestone.  These soils are on hills, canyon walls, ridges, mountains and structural bench.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
