    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in alluvium or lacustrine sediments of mixed mineralogy and may have some eolian admixture.  Average annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches, including\n0.5 to 2 feet of snow, and the average annual air temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

Nyssa soils are coarse-silty.  Sagehill soils lack duripans.  Letha soils have high exchangeable sodium, lack a duripan, and are on low terraces.  Minidoka, Cencove, and Nyssa soils are on landscape positions similar to Truesdale soils."
