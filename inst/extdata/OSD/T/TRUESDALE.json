  "OVERVIEW": "The Truesdale series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils on level to sloping terraces and basalt plains.  They formed in alluvium or lacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 51\ndegrees F.",
