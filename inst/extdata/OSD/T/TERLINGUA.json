  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Terlingua soils are on ridges and side slopes of igneous hills and mountains.  Slopes are mostly 5 to 25 percent but range from 2 to about 65 percent.  Rock outcrops and boulders are common in these areas.  These soils are formed over intrusive and extrusive igneous rock, probably andesite and basalt, having gas voids.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with summer maximums.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 76 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 220 to 280, and elevation is 1,800 to 4,445 feet."

Coranzones soils are deep and formed in slightly lower and similar positions in gravelly outwash valley fill.  Studybutte soils are shallow to bedrock.  Blackgap and Mariscal soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  Strawhouse soils have a petrocalcic horizon."

Carbonates are from secondary sources, probably eolian materials.\nSoil temperature regime classification changed from thermic to hyperthermic based on the summary of a 6-year soil temperature study in Far West Texas.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nMoisture and temperature regime revised for TX622, Brewster County, TX, Main Part recorrelation, 11/2007, CEM\nType location was moved to better represent the series concept, January 2008\nRevised for the correlation of Big Bend National Park, TX, Oct. 2010, CEM\nRevised for the correlation of Hudspeth County, Texas (Main Part) and Culberson County, Texas (Main Part); July, 2012, NMS\nRevised for the correlation of Presidio County, Texas ; Oct, 2012, WWJ\nADDITIONAL DATA:  TAES Characterization data from one pedon in Big Bend National Park; No. S80TX-043-012.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
