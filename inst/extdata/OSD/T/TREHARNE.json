  "OVERVIEW": "The Treharne series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed silty alluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rock types. Treharne soils occur on low stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Hue is 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y. The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay content and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Aquic conditions occur below depth of 20 inches in normal years as indicated by the presence of redox depletions and concentrations. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Redox concentrations occur below 15 inches in some pedons. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are below depths of 24 inches and occur within the top 10 inches of the argillic horizon. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist. Redox concentrations are distinct or prominent grayish brown, yellowish brown, brown and strong brown. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay with 18 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid."
