  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Hue is 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y. The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay content and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Aquic conditions occur below depth of 20 inches in normal years as indicated by the presence of redox depletions and concentrations. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Redox concentrations occur below 15 inches in some pedons. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are below depths of 24 inches and occur within the top 10 inches of the argillic horizon. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist. Redox concentrations are distinct or prominent grayish brown, yellowish brown, brown and strong brown. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay with 18 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Treharne soils occur on low stream terraces along major drainages in the Coast Range Mountains. Elevations are 20 to 1200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in mixed silty alluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rock types. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The frost-free period is 110 to 220 days."
