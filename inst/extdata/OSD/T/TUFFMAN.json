  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuffman series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks and tufa deposits.  Tuffman soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

The lithic materials are bedded layers of tufa.  Tufa is a chemical sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate and silica and deposited from solution in the water of springs adjacent to lakes.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent.\nRock fragments: Averages more than 60 percent gravel and cobbles.  Lithology of fragments is tufa and mixed rocks including volcanic and granitic.\nV horizons\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nBk horizons\nHue &.5YR or 10YR.\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nTexure loam or sandy loam with more than 60 percent gravel and cobbles.\nCalcium Carbonate equivalent by weight: 15 to 30 percent.\nC horizons\nPresent in some pedons.\nR layer\nLithic materials composed of lithoid or dendritic tufa with some fine-earth in cracks and pockets. Thin plates of harder travertine or thinolite tufa may be present in some pedons.\nOther features: Material including lake deposites and bedrock may be present below the lithic contact; other layers of tufa may be present between uncemented lake deposites ranging from silt loam to cobbles."
