  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 13 inches thick.  These soils are typically calcareous to the surface.  Where pedons are leached a few inches, they are always calcareous when mixed to 7 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  When averaged, clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent in the partical size control section and coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent above 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is typically moderately alkaline and less typically mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 35 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 25 to 35 percent in the upper part to up to 70 percent below 40 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Elevations range from 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches but ranges from 15 to 19 inches.   The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.\nbut ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 80 to 100 days."
