  "OVERVIEW": "The Teedown series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived mostly from shale and quartz diorite.  Teedown soils are on mountain slopes and mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
