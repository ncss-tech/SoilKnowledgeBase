  "OVERVIEW": "The Terlak series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in volcanic ash over slope alluvium on swales on plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.",
