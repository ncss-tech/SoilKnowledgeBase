  "OVERVIEW": "The Totem series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice.  Totem soils are on mountainsides, toeslopes, benches and U-shaped valleys at elevations of 2,600 to 5,500 feet. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

They formed in volcanic ash and pumice from Glacier Peak.  Elevations are 2,600 to 5,500 feet.  The soils are in a marine-influenced climate with cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 50 to 75 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, and the July temperature is about 59 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 43 degrees F.  The growing season, at 28 degrees F, is 100 to 130 days."
