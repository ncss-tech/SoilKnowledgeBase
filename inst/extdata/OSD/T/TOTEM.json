The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days during summer.  The upper 20 to 35 inches of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, 15-bar water content of 12 to 15 percent, and 5 to 20 percent pumice.  The lower part of the particle-size control section has 35 to 90 percent pumice.  Thickness of the spodic horizon ranges from 1 to 7 inches.\nThe E horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist.  It has 0 to 10 percent pumice.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has a chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is medial sandy loam, paragravelly medial sandy loam or paragravelly medial loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent pumice.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 8 moist or dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Totem soils are in U-shaped valleys influenced by alpine glaciation and on mountainsides, toeslopes, benches and valley bottoms.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  They formed in volcanic ash and pumice from Glacier Peak.  Elevations are 2,600 to 5,500 feet.  The soils are in a marine-influenced climate with cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 50 to 75 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, and the July temperature is about 59 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 43 degrees F.  The growing season, at 28 degrees F, is 100 to 130 days."
