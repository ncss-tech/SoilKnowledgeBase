    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tiger Creek soils are on mountain slopes, ridges, and high hills. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium or residuum derived from impure limestone or marble. In some Tiger Creek soils the colluvium is derived from non-calcareous metasedimentary rocks such as schist, phyllite, argillite and/or quartzite. Elevation ranges from 540 to 915 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 885 to 1085 mm, some of which falls as snow. The mean annual air temperature is about 14 to 16 degrees C. Average January air temperature is about 7 degrees C and average July air temperature is about 24 degrees C. The average frost free season ranges from 215 to 250 days."

The Arpatutu, Nedsgulch, Sites, and Wallyhill soils formed in non-calcareous metasedimentary rocks such as schist, argillite, phyllite, and quartzite. The Arpatutu soils are on concave hillslopes, have greater than 35 percent fragments in the particle-size control section, and a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm below the mineral soil surface. Nedsgulch soils are in similar positions and have 7.5YR or 5YR hues in the upper Bt horizons. The Sites soils are on mountains and ridges and have clay contents greater than 35 percent in the particle-size control section, and a percent base saturation of less than 35 percent at 125 cm below the upper boundary of the argillic. The Wallyhill soils are on convex hillslopes and have paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. Mercercave soils form in marble on shoulders and upper backslopes of hills and have greater than 35 percent fragments in the particle-size control section."

There is a moderately deep unnamed minor component mapped with the Tiger Creek soil in the Amador Area, CA soil survey area. Soil survey update work in that area should investigate if a moderately deep named component in that map unit is warranted. The soil depth for this series is now confined to the deep and very deep classes. The bedrock is assumed to be lithic based on observations of the moderately deep Mercercave soils, which are found on a similar geologic unit in the Central Sierra Foothills Area, CA soil survey area. Further investigation is needed to determine if there is bedrock contact at this type location."
