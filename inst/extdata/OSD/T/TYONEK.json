  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tyonek series consist of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials interlayered with strata of ash-influenced loess and alluvium.  Tyonek soils are in depressional areas along the toeslopes of moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Strata of mineral material, including volcanic ash, occur throughout the profile.  Combined thickness of the mineral strata is less than 12 inches.  The subsurface tier is dominantly highly decomposed forest litter, sedges, and grasses with less than 15 percent fibers after rubbing.  Content of woody fragments throughout the profile ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  Buried logs and branches occur in some pedons.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.  The pH (0.01M CaC12) of the organic materials is 4.5 or greater within some parts of the control section.\nThe organic materials have hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.\nThe mineral strata have value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Textures range from silt loam to sand."
