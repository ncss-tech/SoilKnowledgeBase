  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Strata of mineral material, including volcanic ash, occur throughout the profile.  Combined thickness of the mineral strata is less than 12 inches.  The subsurface tier is dominantly highly decomposed forest litter, sedges, and grasses with less than 15 percent fibers after rubbing.  Content of woody fragments throughout the profile ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  Buried logs and branches occur in some pedons.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.  The pH (0.01M CaC12) of the organic materials is 4.5 or greater within some parts of the control section.\nThe organic materials have hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.\nThe mineral strata have value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Textures range from silt loam to sand."

Chichantna soils are formed in decomposing moss and sedge peat.  Doroshin and Nikolai soils have a mineral layer thicker than 12 inches within the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in decomposing forest and grass litter.  These organic materials are interlayered with ash-influenced loess and alluvium.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 30 to 34 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches."

Kichatna  soils are poorly drained mineral soils on adjacent steep slopes.  Spenard and Strandline are mineral soils on adjacent forested moraines.  Starichkof soils consist of dominantly hemic material and occur in muskegs."
