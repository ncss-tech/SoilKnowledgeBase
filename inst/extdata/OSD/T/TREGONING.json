The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 48 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 290 to 330 days."
