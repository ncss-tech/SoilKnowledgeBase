  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth and thickness are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to stratified silty, loamy, and sandy lacustrine sediments range from 40 to 60 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the underlying sediment. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the sandy mantle. Cobbles are absent in the underlying sediment. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the sandy mantle and moderately acid to slightly acid in the lower part. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the underlying sediment. Redox concentrations occur within 40 inches. Saturation occurs at 30 to 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 4. Typically, the strata are fine sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, or loam but thin strata of silty clay loam, silt loam, silt, fine sandy loam, and sand are in many pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tourtillotte soils are on stream terraces and in glacial lake basins and glaciofluvial valleys. Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent. Tourtillotte soils formed in sandy deposits underlain by stratified lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 33 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from 820 to 1,150 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crex (T) and Ingalls soils. The moderately well drained Crex soils are on nearby areas where the soil is sandy throughout. The somewhat poorly drained Ingalls soils are in lower nearby areas where the sandy mantle is only 20 to 40 inches thick. Ingalls soils have a spodic horizon which develops under the hemlock trees common on somewhat poorly drained areas."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is very slow or slow. Permeability is rapid in the sandy deposits and moderately slow in the stratified lacustrine sediments. Tourtillotte soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly in woodland. Timber stands are mostly red maple, northern red oak, aspen, and eastern white pine with white oak, northern pin oak, sugar maple, American basswood, paper birch, white ash, and American beech as associates in most stands. Red pine and black cherry are associates in some stands. Some areas are cleared and used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland."
