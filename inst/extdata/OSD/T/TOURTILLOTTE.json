  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tourtillotte series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on stream terraces and in glacial lake basins and glaciofluvial valleys. They formed in sandy deposits underlain by stratified lacustrine sediments. Permeability is rapid in the sandy deposits and moderately slow in the stratifiedlacustrine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to stratified silty, loamy, and sandy lacustrine sediments range from 40 to 60 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the underlying sediment. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the sandy mantle. Cobbles are absent in the underlying sediment. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the sandy mantle and moderately acid to slightly acid in the lower part. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the underlying sediment. Redox concentrations occur within 40 inches. Saturation occurs at 30 to 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.
