  "OVERVIEW": "The Tottles series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Tottles soils are on stream terraces and drainageways and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 432 cm.",
