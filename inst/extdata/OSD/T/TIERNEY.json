  "OVERVIEW": "The Tierney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Tierney soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and inset fans. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
