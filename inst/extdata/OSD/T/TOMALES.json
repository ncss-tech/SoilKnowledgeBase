  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of soft sandstone is more than 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 degrees to 58 degrees F. The soil between the depths of 9 and 17 inches is usually moist in all parts from mid-November to June. It is moist in some part the rest of the year. Moisture in the summer is due, in part, from heavy fog and low evapotranspiration rates. Base saturation is less than 50 percent in some part of the A horizon.  Organic carbon ranges from 1 to 6 percent to depths of less than 20 inches. Clay increases by at least 15 percent (absolute) from the lower part of the A2 horizon to the upper part of the B2t horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2 or 3/2. It is loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam and averages less than 35 percent clay. This horizon is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe A2 horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 6/3, or 7/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/3 or 5/3. There are few or common, faint to prominent mottles of 10YR 5/2 or 5/3 and 5YR 4/2 or 4/3 moist. This horizon is silt loam or loam. It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe B2 horizon is variegated with dry colors of 2.5Y 6/2, 7/4 and 7/6 and moist color of 10YR 5/3, 5/6 and 6/3, with common or many prominent mottles of 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8 or 8/8 dry and 10YR 4/6 or 5/6 moist. It is clay or clay loam and averages more than 35 percent clay. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Cr horizon is soft sandstone and crushes to loam or sandy loam."

The climate is subhumid mesothermal with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches. Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F. Frost-free season is 270 to 300 days."
