  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Tirzah soils were previously mapped in the Carolina Slate Belt of North Carolina, South Carolina, and possibly Georgia during the 1950s and 1960s. The series was made inactive due to overlapping soil properties with competing series. Since the early 1970s, Tirzah soils have been mapped with Georgeville, Mecklenburg, Cullen, Hiwassee, Coronaca, Davidson, Uwharrie, and less commonly Lloyd soils. Taxonomic division of clayey Ultisols into fine or very-fine families allows for the reactivation of the series. It is confined to residual materials derived from rocks associated with the Carolina Slate Belt geologic\nformations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone between 0 and 10 centimeters (about 0 to 4 inches) (A horizon)\nKandic horizon--the zone from 10 to 135 centimeters (about 4 to 53 inches) (Bt horizons\nArgillic horizon--the zone between 10 and 135 centimeters (about 4 to 53 inches) (Bt horizons)\nSeries control--section: 0 to 200 centimeters (about 0 to 79 inches)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: Reference data are available from the NRCS-Soil Survey\nLaboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; sampled as the Cullen Series, Sample\nNumber=95P5897 and 95P5898).\nDatabase Information:\nData Mapunit ID--TBD\nUser Pedon ID--TBD\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
