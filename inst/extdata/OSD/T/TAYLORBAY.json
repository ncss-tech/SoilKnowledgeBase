    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on level to nearly level natural levee positions and nearly level low ridges in point bar deposits on the flood plain of the White River in the Western Lowlands of Arkansas.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Taylorbay soils formed in silty alluvium from the Ozark Uplands and Western Lowlands.  Mean annual rainfall is about 51 inches and mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. near the type location."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kobel, Tipp and Yancopin series.  All are on similar landscapes.  Kobel soils are in a fine particle-size class, do not have a mollic epipedon and are poorly drained.  Tipp soils are in a fine particle-size class and are moderately well drained.  Yancopin soils are in a fine-silty particle-size class, do not have a mollic epipedon and are somewhat poorly drained."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; negligible to low surface runoff: moderate permeability.  Unprotected areas of these soils flood for brief to very long periods mostly during the winter and early spring.  These soils typically have an apparent seasonal water table at 4 to 6 feet for brief periods in winter and early spring."
