  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid throughout.  Weighted average of gravel in the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture ranges from very gravelly loam to very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe R horizon consists of indurated plutonic rock."

They formed in regolith consisting of gravelly shallow residuum that was derived from plutonic rocks, mainly quartz diorite or granodiorite.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 80 to 90 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 77 to 80 degrees F."

The somewhat poorly drained Candelero and Cayagua are on lower positions, are very deep, have argillic horizons, and have more fines in the control section.  The well to excessively drained Mayo soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and have fewer rock fragments in the control section.  Patillas and Pandura series are on similar positions, formed in more weathered and softer plutonic rocks, and have fewer rock fragments in the control section.  In addition, Patillas soils are very deep and have argillic horizons while Pandura soils do not have an umbric epipedon."
