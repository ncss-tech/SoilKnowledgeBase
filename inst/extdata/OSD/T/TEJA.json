  "REVDATE": "06/2004",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Teja series consists of shallow, well drained, rapidly permeable soils on side slopes in uplands.  They formed in gravelly residuum from plutonic rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches.  Slopes range from 12 to 40 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the hard plutonic rock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  CEC is 24 to 40 meq/100 grams of clay or more in all horizons above the lithic contact.  Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid throughout.  Weighted average of gravel in the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture ranges from very gravelly loam to very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe R horizon consists of indurated plutonic rock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teja soils are on upland side slopes.  Slopes range from 12 to 40 percent.  They formed in regolith consisting of gravelly shallow residuum that was derived from plutonic rocks, mainly quartz diorite or granodiorite.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 80 to 90 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 77 to 80 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Candelero, Cayagua, Mayo, Patillas, and Pandura series.  The somewhat poorly drained Candelero and Cayagua are on lower positions, are very deep, have argillic horizons, and have more fines in the control section.  The well to excessively drained Mayo soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and have fewer rock fragments in the control section.  Patillas and Pandura series are on similar positions, formed in more weathered and softer plutonic rocks, and have fewer rock fragments in the control section.  In addition, Patillas soils are very deep and have argillic horizons while Pandura soils do not have an umbric epipedon."
