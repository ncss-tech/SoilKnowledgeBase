  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenabo series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that are formed in a thin loess mantle high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Tenabo soils are on fan piedmonts and plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
