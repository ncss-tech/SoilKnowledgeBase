    "content": "REMARKS: This update changes the classification from Aridic Argiustolls to Torrertic Argiustolls based on laboratory data from Las Animas County, Colorado. This update also moves the type location to Colfax County, New Mexico and is representative of northeastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 11 inches. (A and AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 11 to 36 inches. (Bt and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 36 to 60 inches thick. (BCk horizon)\nTorrertic feature: Linear extensibility exceeds 6.0 cm between the mineral soil surface and 100 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory number: S87CO-071-004\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
