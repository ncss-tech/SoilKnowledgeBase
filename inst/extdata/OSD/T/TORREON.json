  "OVERVIEW": "The Torreon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium from basalt that is slightly modified by eolian sediments. Torreon soils are on basalt mesas, lava plateaus, and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F..",

(A and AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 11 to 36 inches. (Bt and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 36 to 60 inches thick. (BCk horizon)\nTorrertic feature: Linear extensibility exceeds 6.0 cm between the mineral soil surface and 100 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory number: S87CO-071-004\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
