  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil thickness and depth to limestone ranges from 20 to 51 inches.  One or more Cg horizons may occur at any depth, but the combined thickness is less than 1/2 the control section.  Soil reaction is greater than 4.5 in 0.01 molar calcium chloride in the organic material.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The fiber content is less than 33 percent unrubbed, and less than 5 percent rubbed.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract has hue of 10YR; value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 4 or less; value of 5, and chroma of 2 through 8; value of 6, and chroma of 3 through 8; or value of 7, and chroma of 4 through 8.  A thin paraphyton or marl layer may overlie the Oa horizon in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  This horizon may contain up to 20 percent whole shells or shell fragments up to 5 cm. in diameter; calcium carbonate equivalencies range from 80 to nearly 100 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline.  Texture is marl, silt loam or silt."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Lauderhill, Pahokee and Terra Ceia soils lack marl layers within the control section.  In addition, Terra Ceia soils are greater than 51 inches to limestone.  Dania soils are less than 20 inches deep to limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in hydrophytic plant remains and calcareous deposits of dominantly silt sized sediments that precipitated from fresh water.  They are underlain by limestone.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The climate is subtropical.  Near the type location the mean annual rainfall is about 63 inches and the mean annual temperature is 74 degrees Fahrenheit."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
