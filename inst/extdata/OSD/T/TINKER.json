The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F with the mean summer soil temperature ranging from 48 to 55 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 33 inches usually is moist in some or all parts between late September and late August and dry in all parts the rest of the time.  Organic matter is more than 1 percent to a depth of 20 inches or more.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent throughout the profile.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 80 percent throughout the profile with the control section averaging more than 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/3 or 3/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2, 2/2, 2/1; and 7.5YR 3/2.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam modified by 15 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Bulk density ranges from about 0.85 to 1.0.  15 bar water to clay ratio is about 1.25 to 2.0.\nThe Bw horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 6/6; 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/6, 5/4; or 5Y 6/3 and moist color of 7.5YR 5/6; 10YR 5/8, 4/6, 3/4; or 5Y 4/3.

Some pedons may have many to common, medium to large prominent mottles of 7.5YR 5/8; 2/5YR 4/8 or 4/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 6/8, 5/8, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 5/6; and 5Y 4/3.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, heavy sandy loam or loam modified by 35 to 80 percent rock fragments.  It is weakly cemented or compacted and very hard or extremely hard when dry in the upper part.  The lower part of the C horizon may contain loamy coarse sand and is non-cemented."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Tinker soils were formerly proposed as loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Duric Haplumbrepts.  There is a dense layer which limits water and roots; however, to date its morpholy has not been determined.  The lab. data does not support a duripan and the evidence for a fragipan is weak.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
