It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nAn AC horizon is present in some pedons. It has the the combined properties of the A and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is  neutral or mildly alkaline.  Textures are loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay, 5 to 25 percent silt, and 65 to 85 prrcent sand of which more than 35 percent is fine sand or coarser."
