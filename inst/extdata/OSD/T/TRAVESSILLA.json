  "OVERVIEW": "The Travessilla series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in calcareous eolian sediments and material weathered from sandstone. These soils are on hills, cuestas, scarps, and mesas with slopes ranging from 0 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches. The mean annual temperature is above 53 degrees F.",
