  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonkawa series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils.  These nearly level to steep soils formed in sandy beds derived from marine deposits on the Carrizo, Queen City, and Sparta Formations.  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 18 degrees C (65 degrees F); mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).",
