  "OVERVIEW": "The Table Mountain Series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick, calcareous medium textured alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Table mountain soils are on alluvial fans, terraces and concave drains or old flood plains.  They have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.",
