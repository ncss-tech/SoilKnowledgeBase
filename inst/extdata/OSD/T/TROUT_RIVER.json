  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 36 inches. Bedrock is at depths greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the A and E horizons, 20 to 60 in the B horizon, and 35 to 70 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragments are mostly gravel, cobbles, and stones, and aggregate more than 35 percent at a depth of 10 to 40 inches. Limestone and dolomite comprise a large percentage of the rock fragments. There are carbonates within the substratum in some pedons.\nSome pedons have an Oe horizon of 1 or 2 inches thick. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, chroma of 1 or 2. It is slightly decomposed organic material. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to sand. Structure is granular, or the material is single grain. Consistence is friable or loose. Unless limed, reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nAn E horizon occurs in some pedons that is 1 to 4 inches thick. It has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is the same as for the Ap or A horizon.\nBh or Bhs horizons are in some pedons. Texture of the fine earth fraction is a very fine sand, loamy very fine sand or finer through a fine sandy loam and are 1 to 2 inches thick. They have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3, or has hue of 10YR with chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6, or has hue of 10YR with chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or sand. Structure is granular or subangular blocky, or the material is single grain. Consistence is loose or very friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture ranges from very cobbly loamy sand to extremely gravelly sand. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Pelissier and Traunik (T) series is in the same family. These soils do not occur in Land Resource Region R. Pelissier soils contain rock fragments derived from acidic igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Also, the substratum of Pelissier is strongly acid. Traunik (T) soils do not have an OSD on file to differentiate.\nThe Bonaparte, Colosse, Colton, Constable, Hinckley, Hoosic, and Otisville series are members of related families. The Bonaparte, Hinckley, Hoosic, and Otisville soils have mesic temperature regimes. Colosse soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. Colton and Constable soils have a higher organic carbon content in the spodic horizons."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trout River soils are on glacial beaches, terraces and fans. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soil formed in water-sorted sand and gravel deposits. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 90 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 150 to 500 feet above sea level."

Adams and Colton soils are more acid and have strongly expressed spodic horizon. In addition, Adams soils have a sandy particle-size control section. The moderately well drained Coveytown soils, the somewhat poorly drained Fahey soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Cook soils are in adjacent lower areas and form a drainage sequence with Trout River soils. Kalurah and Pyrities soils are on nearby glacial till plains."

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n(2) Spodic horizon - the zone from 8 to 16 inches (Bs horizon).\n(3) Entic Haplorthods- the upper 1 inch of the Bs horizon (8 to 9 inches) having chroma and value of 4 with loamy coarse sand textures\nSoil Interpretation Record No. NY0081, NY0082.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
