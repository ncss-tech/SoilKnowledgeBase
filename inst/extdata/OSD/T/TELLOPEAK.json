  "OVERVIEW": "The Tellopeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rocks. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 110 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1524 millimeters (60 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
