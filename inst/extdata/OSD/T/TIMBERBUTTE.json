  "OVERVIEW": "The Timberbutte series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium weathered from welded tuff mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 35 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
