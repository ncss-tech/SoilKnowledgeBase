  "OVERVIEW": "The Tatai series consists of very deep, well drained, saline and sodic soils that formed in stream alluvium.  Tatai soils are on flood plains and stream terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.",
