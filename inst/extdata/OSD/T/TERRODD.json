  "OVERVIEW": "The Terrodd series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low terraces of mountain valley floors.  Terrodd soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature about 44 degrees F.",
