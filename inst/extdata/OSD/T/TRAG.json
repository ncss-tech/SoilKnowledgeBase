  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in material weathered from granite and schist that has been locally transported in places.  Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,900 feet.  The soils are in a cool semiarid climate with annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost- free season is about 65 to 100 days.  In New Mexico, precipitation ranges to 22 inches with air temperatures down to 40 degrees F. and frost-free periods up to 110 days."

The 2/1999 update reclassified this series to a Pachic Argiustoll, fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid.  Historically this series concept was not pachic.  Therefore, in this update a one inch reduction in the thickness of the mollic epipedon was incorporated and adjustment to the range in characteristics to maintain the series concept as typic.\nTaxanomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
