  "OVERVIEW": "The Trag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite and schist.  Trag soils are on mountains, slopes and fans.   Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The soil formed in material weathered from granite and schist that has been locally transported in places.  Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,900 feet.  The soils are in a cool semiarid climate with annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost- free season is about 65 to 100 days.  In New Mexico, precipitation ranges to 22 inches with air temperatures down to 40 degrees F. and frost-free periods up to 110 days."

The 2/1999 update reclassified this series to a Pachic Argiustoll, fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid.  Historically this series concept was not pachic.  Therefore, in this update a one inch reduction in the thickness of the mollic epipedon was incorporated and adjustment to the range in characteristics to maintain the series concept as typic.\nTaxanomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
