  "OVERVIEW": "The Takeuchi series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from intermediate intrusive rocks.  They are on foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
