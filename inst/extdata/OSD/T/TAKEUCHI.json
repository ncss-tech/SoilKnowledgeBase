Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite, quartz monzonite, other intermediate intrusive rocks.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  The average annual precipitation is 360 to 610 mm.  The average annual temperature is 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 55 to 100 days."
