    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification history.\n1.1992 Ashy, frigid Mollic Vitrandepts\n2.1992 Ashy, Vitrandic Haploborolls\n3.2001 Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haplustolls\n4.2001 Ashy, glassy, mesic Vitritorrandic Haplustolls\nUsing current conventions, the plant community for this soil in northern New Mexico is considered to represent a moisture regime of ustic bordering on aridic, and a temperature regime of mesic. Therefore, the change from a typic-ustic frigid concept was made. Ranges for air temperature and frost free days were adjusted accordingly.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon:  from 0 to 15 inches.  (A horizon)\nVitritorrandic feature:  Based on glass content throughout the upper 30 inches (glass count of 65) (A, C1, and part of C2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A, the C1, and part of C2 horizons). The entire control section meets criteria for the Ashy class.\nIt appears that this soil typically has an irregular decrease in organic matter, and would be in a 100-year flood zone, and hence would be on landforms such as flood plains and flood-plain steps.  This is not conclusive and needs further study.\nTaxonomic version: classified according to the Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA: (Not this pedon) NSSL No. S80NM-028-002 and S92NM-028-001.\nAcid Oxalate Extractable Iron and Aluminum were 0.04 each and Phosphorus retention was 17.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
