  "OVERVIEW": "The Tusccoll series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from volcanic rocks.  Tusccoll soils are on backslopes in canyons in Cascade mountains.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches, (1651 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, (13 degrees C).",
