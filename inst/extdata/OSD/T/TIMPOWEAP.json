  "OVERVIEW": "The Timpoweap series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from limestone on dipslopes of cuestas, and structural benches. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
