It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon, and BC horizon where present, have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, is colluvium that is similar in color to the BC horizon, or is mottled or multicolored.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Rock fragment content is typically 15 to 60 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crossnore, Jeffrey, Porters, Unaka, and Whiteoak series. Crossnore and Jeffrey soils formed in residuum and Whiteoak in colluvium derived from low-grade metamorphic rock such as metasandstone and contain fragments of those rocks.  In addition, Crossnore soils have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Jeffrey and Unaka soils have hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.   Porters soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Whiteoak soils have Bw horizons with clay content ranging from 18 to 29 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tusquitee soils are on benches, foot slopes, toe slopes, and fans in coves in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Elevations are generally between 2,000 and 4,200 feet.  Slopes are commonly between 15 and 50 percent but range from 2 to 95 percent.  These soils formed in loamy colluvium derived from materials weathered from igneous and high-metamorphic rocks such as granite, mica gneiss, hornblende gneiss, and schist.  Tusquitee soils receive moisture from surrounding uplands, and springs and local seepage areas are common.  Climate is temperate and humid.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches."

Ashe, Chandler, Chestnut, Cowee, Edneyville, Evard, Fannin, Plott, Porters, Unaka, and Watauga soils are on mountain ridges and side slopes.  Brevard, Cullasaja, Greenlee, Haywood, Saunook, Sylva, Tate, Tuckasegee, and Whiteside soils are in colluvial landscape positions.  Ashe, Chestnut, and Cowee soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cashiers, Chandler, Fannin, and Watuaga soils are in a micaceous family.   Brevard, Cowee, Evard, Fannin, Saunook, Tate, Watauga and Whiteside soils have argillic horizons.  Cullasaja and Greenlee soils are loamy-skeletal.  Haywood and Tuckasegee soils have an umbric epipedon.  Brevard, Saunook, and Tate soils are in seepage areas of toe slopes and fans.  Sylva soils are poorly drained and Whiteside soils are moderately well drained."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The 12/97 revision places the Tusquitee series in a fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Umbric Dystrochrepts family. This series was formerly placed in a coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Umbric Dystrochrepts family.  Laboratory PSA (pipette) method and corresponding field texture estimates (feel method) indicate control section clay contents of generally 12 to 24 percent, with most pedons marginally coarse-loamy.  However, chemical lab data for similar competing series indicate that sufficient amorphous, clay-sized materials occur in the particle-size control section to place this soil in a fine-loamy family.  Average clay contents are generally less than 25 percent.\nUsing the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996), Tusquitee soils would classify as fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Andic Dystrochrepts.  However, a proposal has been made to add a acid oxalate-extractable silicon requirement to Andic subgroups, which would exclude Crossnore soils, which lack volcanic glass.\nThe 3/99 revision updates classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches (Oe, A1 and A2 horizons)\nUmbric feature - the A1 horizon has moist value of 3 and moist chroma of 2 to a depth of 8 inches.\nCambic horizon - the zone between depths of 11 and 49 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3 and BC horizons)\nIsotic mineralogy class - within the PSCS the soil generally has high amorphous materials (high pH-dependent charge) and a high moisture retention (at 1500 kPa) to clay ratio.\nProperties that would place the soil in an Andic subgroup--a horizon or horizons with total thickness of 7 inches (18 cm) or more within 30 inches (75 cm) of the mineral soil surface with a fine-earth bulk density of 1.0 g/cm3 or less (at 33 kPa water retention) and ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages totaling more than 1.0.\nRevised: 9/88-DLN,DJT,RAG; 1/98-DHK; 3/99-MKC\n01-2011   Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification --  BPS\nADDITIONAL DATA: Mineralogy data is available from the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln NE; pedon numbers S88-NC-199-001 and -021.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
