Bowbells, Flaxton, Fiesta, Hereford, Pachel and Weed soils have continuous horizons of visible calcium carbonate accumulation.  Cambern soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Carfall, Jaythree, and Laceycreek soils do not have rock fragments of latite, dacite, or tuff. Center Creek, Hesperus, and Peta soils have redoximorphic features within 60 inches.  Chugcreek soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Detra soils have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.  Gordo soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Ohwiler soils have less than 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the argillic horizon.  Schauson soils have moisture control sections that are dry for 50 to 55 percent of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Todacheene soils have rock fragments of basalt and basaltic tuff in the lower Bt horizons.."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tschicoma soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of valley sides and undulating plateaus. They formed in slope alluvium derived from Tertiary age latite and dacite, and Quaternary age rhyolitic tuff. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,800 to 9,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 28 inches with about 40 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

Jemez soils are moderately deep, do not have mollic epipedons, and occur on summits and shoulders of interfluves on undulating plateaus.  Lucito soils are clayey-skeletal and occur on toeslopes and footslopes of mountains.  Tranquilar soils are very-fine, have smectitic mineralogy, and occur on flood plains."

(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 21 to 41 inches (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Soil Taxonomy, 2nd Edition, 1999.\nThis series was originally proposed in the Rio Arriba Area, New Mexico. It was dropped during the correlation of Rio Arriba. It is re-proposed in the Bandelier Area with a simliar series concept. However, any connection to the soil in the Rio Arriba area is removed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
