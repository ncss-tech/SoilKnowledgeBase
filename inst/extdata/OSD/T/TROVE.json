  "OVERVIEW": "The Trove series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Trove soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches (41 cm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F (5.0 degrees C).",
