  "OVERVIEW": "The Texana series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of late Pleistocene age.  These soils are on relic meander belts on flat coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 in).",
