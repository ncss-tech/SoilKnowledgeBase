In addition, Bernard soils have an A horizon less than 25 cm (10 in) thick.\nDacosta soils: do not have an abrupt texture change between the surface and argillic horizons.\nFaddin soils: do not have a continuous albic horizon.\nOlga and Rolette soils: are in a frigid temperature regime.  In addition, Olga soils formed in clayey colluvium from shale bedrock.\nRolette soils: formed in glaciolacustrine or deltaic deposits.\nSpindletop soils: do not have vertic properties and are saturated for long periods."
