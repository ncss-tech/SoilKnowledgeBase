  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunica series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium and the underlying loamy alluvium. These soils are on the lower parts of natural levees on the younger meander belts of the Mississippi River and its tributaries of the Lower Mississippi Valley. Slope is dominantly 0 to 3 percent but ranges to 5 percent on narrow ridges within the flood plain. Mean annual precipitation is about 1371 millimeters (54 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.5 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
