  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a mollic epipedon from the surface to 12 inches, a cambic horizon from 12 to 30 inches, a zone of carbonate accumulation from 30 to 38 inches, and a weakly cemented duripan from 38 to 40 inches. Dense lodgement till occurs from 40 to 60 inches.  The upper 21 inches of the profile has an estimated 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass content (see additional data).   The particle-size control section is the zone from 10 to 38 inches (the lower part of the A and the Bw1, Bw2 and the 2Bk horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Complete NSSL lab characterization data is available under another pedon number 90P1011.  Glass grain counts are COSI = 6 and VFS = 19, estimated glass content are FS = 19 and with pumice in the profile coarse ash is estimated to be 95 percent of MS, CS, VCS fraction.  Calculated glass content is 45 percent of the 0.02 to 2mm fraction.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
