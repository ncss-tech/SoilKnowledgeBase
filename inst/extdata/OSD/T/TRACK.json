  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are saturated at some season and are continuously moist in some part between depths of 8 and 24 inches.  The particle size control section averages 50 to 65 percent coarse fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It has weak or moderate angular blocky or subangular blocky structure.  It is loam, gravelly loam or silt loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe IIB and IIC horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1, 2 or 3 dry or moist.  They have distinct or prominent mottles.  They are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Track soils are in alluvial bottomlands at elevations of 700 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in recent alluvium.  They are in a climate with a mean annual precipitation of 6 to 10 inches with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average January temperature is 29 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 73 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 130 to 180 days."
