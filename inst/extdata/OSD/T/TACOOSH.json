  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the C horizon ranges from 16 to 50 inches.  The organic part of the control section is derived primarily from herbaceous plants, however, as much as 50 percent of the recognizable fibers are woody in some pedons.  Coarse woody fragments ranging in size from 2 cm to 3 or 4 inches in cross section comprise 10 to 20 percent of the volume of the organic part of the soil.\nThe organic material (broken face, rubbed or pressed) has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Individual layers of less decomposed material have a value of 4 or 5.  Hemic material is dominant in the organic part of the control section, however, layers of sapric and/or fibric materials less than 5 cumulative inches thick are below the surface tier in some pedons.  The mineral content throughout the organic part typically is less than 20 percent, and ranges up to about 40 percent just above the C horizon in some pedons.  The organic materials range from pH 5.5 to less than 7.8 in 0.01M calcium chloride, however in some pedons, layers have a pH of less than 5.5.  The surface tier typically is sapric or hemic material, however, some pedons have a surface mat of living sphagnum moss up to 6 inches thick.  This tier typically has a weak to moderate granular structure.  The organic part of the subsurface and bottom tiers has a weak granular, platy or subangular blocky structure.  Some layers are massive.\nSome pedons have an A horizon.  The A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 1 or 2, or is N2/ or N3/.  It is sandy loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  The pH is 5.5 or above and is calcareous in some places."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dordhin, Hewitt, and the Tepete series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Cathro, Dawson, Greenwood, Markey, Rifle, and Tawas soils.  Doroshin and Hewitt soils do not have calcareous materials in the underlying material within the control section.  Tepete soils are in a drier climate and have no woody fragments in the organic material.  Cathro soils have sapric material dominant in the organic part of the control section.  Dawson, Markey and Tawas soils have sandy C horizons and have sapric material dominant in the organic part.  Greenwood and Rifle soils formed in organic material more than 51 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tacoosh soils are in depressional areas within till plains, moraines, lake plain and outwash plains.  Individual bogs range from small enclosed depressions of only a few acres to those of several hundred acres.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 25 to 35 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 44 degrees F."

Angelica, Ensley, Gay, Pleinet and Witbeck soils are poorly drained coarse-loamy mineral soils which are common associates near the edge of the bog and are inclusions within the mapping unit in some areas."
