    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The soils are usually moist but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches during summer and fall of most years.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to about 25 percent clay, and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. The soils are neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Basalt pebbles range from 0 to 20 percent."

Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Gwin soils are underlain by bedrock at a depth of 10 to 20 inches, and are loamy-skeletal.  Mondovi and Patit Creek soils are deep and have organic matter content that decreases irregularly with depth.  Waha soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon."
