  "OVERVIEW": "The Tucannon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  They are on benches and plateaus and in the channeled scablands.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches during summer and fall of most years.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to about 25 percent clay, and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. The soils are neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.

Mondovi and Patit Creek soils are deep and have organic matter content that decreases irregularly with depth.  Waha soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon."
