Algansee soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth. Altmar soils average more than 2 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Birchwood soils have densic materials in the lower part of the series control section. Brems and Elnora soils do not have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 51 cm.  Brockatonorton soils have a buried histic epipedon in the lower part of the series control section. Deerfield and Morocco soils are more acid than neutral in the lower part of the series control section. Fortress soils have anthrotransported material within the series control section. Livonia soils have a loamy substratum in the lower part of the series control section. Meckling soils are calcareous throughout the series control section. Ottokee soils have thin lamellae within a depth of 127 cm and do not have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 51 cm. Partridge soils have a lithic contact between 51 and 102 cm. Succotash soils do not have a B horizon. Zaborosky soils have a buried soil within a depth of 102 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tedrow soils are on low beach ridges, glacial deltas, water-lain moraines, dunes on lake plains, till-floored lake plains, nearshore zones, and on outwash plains. They are on convex and linear surfaces and typically have slope gradients of 0 to 4 percent but range to 6 percent. The soils formed in glaciolacustrine or eolian sand typically dominated by fine sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 960 mm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C . Frost-free period is 135 to 210 days. Elevation is 175 to 244 meters above mean sea level."

The very poorly drained or poorly drained Granby soils are in low topographic positions or in depressions. The excessively drained Oakville soils and the moderately well drained Ottokee soils are on higher beach ridges and dunes or on more sloping areas. The Arkport, Galen, and Spinks soils have an argillic horizon consisting of thin lamellae and are on higher beach ridges and dunes or on more sloping areas. The coarse-loamy Gilford soils are in nearby loamy deposits."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less in all horizons below a depth of 41 cm.\nThe loamy substratum phase mapped in earlier surveys has a loamy substratum within 152 cm (60 inches). This phase likely will be recorrelated as a new series when its area of use is updated. An MLRA update project \"Evaluation of Tedrow loamy substratum phases on the Huron-Erie Lake Plain\" has been proposed.\nThe till substratum phase has till (with 27 to 42 percent clay) within a depth of 71 to 122 cm. This phase needs to be evaluated during MLRA update activities.\nA phase with a surface layer of human transported material has been correlated.  This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable texture.\nSome pedons formerly included in the concept of the Tedrow series are grayer than the present series concept and would be classified as Typic Psammaquents. These grayer soils are unnamed at present and are included in mapping with the Tedrow series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for pedons HN-1, PD-44, PT-23, and WD-65. This data should be evaluated in the future to determine if it supports the current series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
