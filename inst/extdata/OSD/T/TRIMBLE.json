  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to more than 72 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to to more than 100 inches.  The soil ranges from extremely acid to medium acid,  Rock fragments are mostly chert, but may include limestone and sandstone fragments and are mostly gravel or cobble size.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 10 to 50 percent in individual horizons but the particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some wooded areas have thin A horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 0 to 1.  Texture of the fine earth is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have AB or E horizons with colors and textures similar to the Ap or A horizon.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine earth is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue that is dominantly 10YR or 7.5YR but ranges to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have subhorizons with hue of 5YR.  The lower part of the Bt horizon may have few to many mottles in shades of brown, gray, or red.  Texture of the fine earth is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons may have subhorizons with texture of clay.\nSome pedons have BC or C horizons with colors and textures similar to the lower part of the Bt horizon."

Brocket soils have loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam Bt horizons with less than 15 percent sandstone fragments.  Claiborne and Nolichucky soils have Bt horizons with hue that are mostly 2.5YR.  Nolichucky soils form in alliuium direct from sandstone, shale, quartzite, and limestone rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trimble soils occupy narrow ridgetops, sideslopes, and toeslopes.  These soils are developed in a regolith from cherty limestone but in some areas it is interbedded with siltstone or fine grained sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  At the type location, average annual precipitation is 49 inches and mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F."

Baxter, Frederick, and Waynesboro soils have B2 horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  Bedford and Tarklin soils have fragipans.  Bewleyville soils have less than 15 percent chert in the upper solum.  Caneyville and Garmon soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches."
