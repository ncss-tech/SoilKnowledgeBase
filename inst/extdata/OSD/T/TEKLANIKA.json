  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teklanika soils occupy rolling to steep dunes associated with outwash plains in interior Alaska.  Slopes are irregular and range from 1 to 70 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation from 10 to 20 inches."
