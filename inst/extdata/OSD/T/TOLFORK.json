The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 20 percent clay, more than 30 percent coarser than fine sand, and has 50 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and may include all or part of the Bw horizon.  The solum is 25 to 35 inches thick.  Soil reaction strongly acid throughout.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly coarse sandy loam averaging 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 30 to 45 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam averaging 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 40 to 50 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly sandy loam averaging 10 to 15 percent clay. It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 20 to 40 percent cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 120 to 160 inches.   The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
