  "OVERVIEW": "The Trapps series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from limestone or argillite and in till.  These soils are on mountains and moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
