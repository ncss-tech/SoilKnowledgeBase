  "OVERVIEW": "The Trapps series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from limestone or argillite and in glacial till.  These soils are on mountains and glacial moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 520 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
