The particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. Some pedons have an Oe horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is dominantly gravelly fine sandy loam, but the range includes cobbly fine sandy loam and fine sandy loam. Volume of gravel ranges from 5 to 20 percent. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid. Some pedons have an A horizon.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. It is gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or the cobbly analogues of these textures. Volume of gravel ranges from 5 to 20 percent. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bs2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value and chroma of 4. It is very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand or the cobbly or very cobbly analogues of these textures. Volume of gravel ranges from 20 to 45 percent.

They formed in a loamy mantle over gravelly and sandy outwash. Elevations range from 900 to 1,100 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 34 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 100 to 120 days."
