Reaction of the mineral layer is extremely acid to strongly acid, and base saturation is less than 35 percent.\nThe Op or Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  The fiber content in the organic portion of the control section is less than 33 percent unrubbed, or more than 33 percent if its content is less than 10 percent of its volume after rubbing.  Sodium pyrophsophate extract is pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3), or dark brown (10YR 3/3).\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy sand.  The 3C and 4C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Weighted clay content of the upper 12 inches of the C horizons within the 51 inch control section is less than 35 percent."
