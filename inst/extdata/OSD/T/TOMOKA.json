  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic material ranges from 16 to 45 inches.  Reaction of the organic layer is less than 4.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride.  Reaction of the mineral layer is extremely acid to strongly acid, and base saturation is less than 35 percent.\nThe Op or Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  The fiber content in the organic portion of the control section is less than 33 percent unrubbed, or more than 33 percent if its content is less than 10 percent of its volume after rubbing.  Sodium pyrophsophate extract is pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3), or dark brown (10YR 3/3).\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy sand.  The 3C and 4C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Weighted clay content of the upper 12 inches of the C horizons within the 51 inch control section is less than 35 percent."

All of these soils are of mineral origin except for Hontoon and Samsula.   Hontoon soils have organic layers to a depth of more than 51 inches.  Samsula soils are sandy in the underlying mineral layers."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Tomoka soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow.  Permeability is moderate.  In drained areas, a water control system regulates the water table according to plant needs.  In undrained areas, the water table is at or on the surface of the soil except during extended dry periods."

Native vegetation is sawgrass, lilies, reeds, sedges, myrtle and other aquatic plants.  Cypress, red and white bay, maple and pond pine are common tree species."
