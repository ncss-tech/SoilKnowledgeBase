  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nTransquaking soil were previously mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. Oxidized pH analysis indicates these soils have hypersulfidic materials (pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation), causing them to typically become ultra acid to extremely acid when drained. Historically, large areas of these soils were ditched for mosquito control, which has led to marsh degradation in some areas.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):\nAquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 203 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)\nFibric soil materials--the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths or more of the soil volume (Oise horizon)\nHemic soil materials--the zone from 23 to 117 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is between one-third and three-fourths of the soil volume (Oese horizons)\nSapric soil materials--the zone from 117 to 165 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume (Oase horizon)\nHypersulfidic materials--the zone from 0 to 56 centimeters and 117 to 203 centimeters (oxidized pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation)\nFluidity--the zone from 165 to 203 centimeters is very fluid (n value > 1.0)"
