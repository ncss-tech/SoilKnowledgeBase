  "OVERVIEW": "The Taloka series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey colluvium and/or alluvium weathered from interbedded shales and sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on interfluves and paleoterraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
