Ashmed, Bitter, Highland, Khyber, Nellake and Timosea soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days between July and September. Blind soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and mean annual soil temperatures of 61 to 66 degrees F.  Ashmed soils have a SAR of 13 to 35 in the argillic horizon and hue of 10YR. Bitter soils are less than 30 inches deep to the base of the argillic and have loamy sand and sand textures below the argillic. Bluebird soils are less than 23 inches to the base of the argillic. Highland soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches. Khyber soils are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel and have secondary silica cementation in the lower part of the subsoil. Nellake soils average less than 20 percent clay in the argillic horizon and less than 15 percent clay in the subsoil. Twobitter soils have accumulations of gypsum in the particle-size control section. Soledad soils average less than 20 percent clay in the control section.  Timosea soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  Tiefort soils are inactive."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Topawa soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent, but are dominantly 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in mixed fan alluvium derived from gneiss, granite, and rhyolite.   Elevation ranges from 2000 to 3200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 260 days."
