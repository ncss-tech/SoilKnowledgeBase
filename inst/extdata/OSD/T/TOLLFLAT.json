  "OVERVIEW": "The Tollflat series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone.  Tollflat soils are on gently sloping to steep ridges and hillslopes on mountain flanks.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
