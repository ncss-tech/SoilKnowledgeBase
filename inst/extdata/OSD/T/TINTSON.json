  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to the loamy 2C horizon range from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average content of silt plus clay is 5 percent or less in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.  Redox concentrations and saturation occur within a depth of 40 inches.  Redox depletions are below 40 inches in the 2C horizon in some pedons.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have a A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 5 to 7, and chromas of 3 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is fine sand or sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is stratified sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."

Arbutus, Rockdam, and Shelldrake soils are frigid.  Boone soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Carver, Hooksan, and Tarr soils have sandy textures to 60 inches or more and do not have redox features or a water table. Gosil soils have more than 5 percent silt plus clay in the particle-size control section.  Tint soils have sandy textures to 60 inches or more."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Tintson soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium underlain by loamy alluvium at 40 to 60 inches.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet."

Excessively drained Boone soils are nearby on uplands where the sandy mantle is underlain by sandstone within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The excessively drained or moderately well drained Impact soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Tintson soils where the surface layer is thicker and darker colored and the loamy substratum is absent.  The excessively drained Tarr soils and the moderately well drained Tint soils are in similar landscape positions where the loamy substratum is absent."

Tintson soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."
