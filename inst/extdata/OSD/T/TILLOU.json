Mottles are in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Texture\nis silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B&A and A&B horizons have B parts with the same color and\ntexture range as the above B2t horizon.  The A part has hue of\n10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe B'2t horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of\n4 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, brown, or red.
