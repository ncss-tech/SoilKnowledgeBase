  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered mica schist is 20 to 40 inches. The soil between the depths of 6 and 22 inches becomes moist in some part sometime in late November and remains moist until May, and is dry for 140 to 150 days during summer and autumn. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 degrees to 58 degrees F.  The profile is 0 to 15 percent by volume rock fragments 2mm to 7cm in diameter and 0 to 1 percent, 7cm to 25cm in diameter. Organic matter is more than 1 percent to a depth of 10 to 15 inches, and decreases to less than 1 percent below this depth. Base saturation is more than 75 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is brown, dark brown, grayish brown, or dark grayish brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3, 5/2, 4/2; 7.5YR 5/2, 4/2). It is sandy loam or loam and has 12 to 25 percent clay and 5 to 10 percent mica. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nMany pedons have an AB or BA transition horizon between the A1 and Bt horizons. It is brown, dark brown, or reddish brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, 4/4; 5YR 5/3, 5/4); values of 4 occur below 10 inches. It is sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam, and is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is brown, dark brown, or reddish brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/4). Moist chroma is generally 4. This horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay and there is an increase of 5 to 12 percent clay from the A horizon to the B2t horizon. It is 5 to 15 percent mica. Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nMost pedons have a BC horizon that is strong brown, reddish yellow, reddish brown, or yellowish red (7.5YR 5/6, 6/6; 5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/6). It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam, and is medium acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that is reddish yellow (5YR 6/6; 7.5YR 7/6, 6/6) sandy loam, sandy clay loam clay loam or loam with up to 30 percent mica. It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon consists of medium to slightly acid, weathered mica schist that will slake when soaked in calgon and water. When crushed, it is loam or clay loam and has up to 50 percent mica."

Colma soils lack a paralithic contact and are mottled in the B2t horizon. Dragoon soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. and are dry 60 to 80 days. Foehlin soils lack a paralithic contact. Gerig soils formed in tuff and are somewhat influenced by pyroclastic materials (less than 60 percent pyroclastic materials). Glenrose soils lack a paralithic contact and have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. Ladd, Snowden and Tieton soils are deeper than 40 inches to rock and have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. Lobitos and Los Gatos soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Mehlhorn and Minerva soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and a mean annual soil temperature of 47 degrees to 54 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tweedy soils are on moderately steep to very steep uplands and have gradients of 15 to 75 percent. They formed from weathered mica schist and igneous rocks including andesite, rhyolite, and granite. Elevations are 3,000 to 6,500 feet. The climate is one of cold moist winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches, some as snow. The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 72 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees to 56 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 150 to 225 days."
