  "OVERVIEW": "The Teneb series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium in drainageways on plateaus or in mountains. Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 36 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
