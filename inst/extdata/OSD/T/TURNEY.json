  "OVERVIEW": "The Turney series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous alluvium on bajadas, terraces and piedmont slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
