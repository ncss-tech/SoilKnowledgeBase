Bridge soils have ash and tuffaceous materials in the particle-size control section.  Chutum, Laverkin and Sotim soils do not have a weakly cemented Bk horizon.  Deltajo soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Weedpatch soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17) receive mostly winter precipitation and usually dry from April through November."

The climate is semiarid to arid continental.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 180 to 240 days.  In Arizona and Texas, elevations are as low as 2,000 feet, precipitation as high as 13 inches, air temperature as high as 70 degrees and frost free season as long as 260 days."
