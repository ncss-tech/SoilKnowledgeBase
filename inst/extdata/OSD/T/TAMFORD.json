    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches to interbedded weathered shales and clay.  Intersecting slickensides occur at depths ranging from 5 to 40 inches.  The\nsoil, if undisturbed, has microlows and microhighs that extend up\nand down the slope.  Distance between center of the microhigh and center of microlow is 5 to 12 feet.  When dry, this soil has\ncracks 1 to 5 cm. in width at a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A1 horizon is brown or dark brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2) reddish\nbrown (5YR 5/3, 4/3), reddish  gray (5YR 5/2), or dark reddish\ngray (5YR 4/2).  The upper 12 inches or more in 51 percent or more\nof each pedon has moist values of 3 and dry values of 4 or 5.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous or calcareous.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay\nloam, or clay with a c*ay content ranging fro 35 to 45 percent.\nThe AC horizon is brown or dark brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2), reddish\nbrown (2.5YR 5/4, 4/4; 5YR 5/4), or +ight reddish brown (5YR 6/4).  Some pedo*s have few to common brownish or reddish mottles in the\nAC horizons.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 50 percent.  Reaction\nis mildly alkaline or moderately alkali\ne a\nd ca+careous in at least the lower part.\nThe C horizon is reddish brown (5YR 5/3)< red (10R 5/69, r light reddish brown (5YR 6/3, 6/4) clay.  Some pedons have few to common brownish or yelloish mottles.  Calcium carbonate concretions ra\nge from 1 to 10 percent by volume in the AC and C horizons."

Anhalt soils have very-fine control sections.  Bonita, Leeray, Paramore, Rimrock, Stamford, Tobosa, and Indiahoma soils are dry\nfor longer periods of time in the moisture control section.\nBranyon, Burleson, Clarita, Dalco, Houston Black, Leson, Randall,\nSan Saba, and Wato\nga soils ha*e chro*a f 1 or less in at +east the upper 12 inches\nyn more than half of each pedon.
