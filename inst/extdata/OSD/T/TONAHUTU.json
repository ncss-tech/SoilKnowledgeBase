  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonahutu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Tonahutu soils are on moraines.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
