  "OVERVIEW": "The Terry series consists of moderately deep to calcareous sandstone, well drained soils that formed in parent sediments weathered residually from underlying soft sandstone.  Terry soils are on hills and ridges and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.",
