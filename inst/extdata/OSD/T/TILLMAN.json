    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nClassification is changed from Typic Paleustolls to Vertic Paleustolls 4/2000 based on data from several pedons. Also the series is being restricted to soils that are very deep to redbed claystone. Soils formerly mapped in the Tillman series on the Blaine Formation will be included mostly with the Westill series, which is deep to redbed claystone.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon:  0 to 45 cm (0 to 18 in) (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon: 10 to 188 cm (4 to 74 in) (Bt and Btk horizons).\nPale feature: Clay content does not decrease by as much as 20 percent from the maximum within 152 cm (60 in) with chroma of 5 or more in some part of the argillic horizon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is based on lab data from several pedons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data, Lab. Nos. 67L538 - 67L543; 67L772, February 1968, and S96OK-065-003.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
