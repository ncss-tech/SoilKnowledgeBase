  "OVERVIEW": "The Torpy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from tuffaceous volcanic rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans and sideslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (A and E horizons); a cambic horizon from 8 to 34 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control from 10 to 40 inches (Bw and BC horizons).  Torpy soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified."
