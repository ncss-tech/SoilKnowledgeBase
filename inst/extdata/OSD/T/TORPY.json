Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (A and E horizons); a cambic horizon from 8 to 34 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control from 10 to 40 inches (Bw and BC horizons).  Torpy soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
