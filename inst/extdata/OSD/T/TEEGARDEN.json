  "OVERVIEW": "The Teegarden series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess, Illinoian age or early Wisconsinan age till and material weathered from the underlying Pennsylvanian age shale, fine-grained sandstone or siltstone on till plains. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, slow in the fragipan and moderate to slow below the fragipan, above bedrock. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS: Teegarden soils were formerly mapped as Titusville and Hanover soils in the 1968 Soil Survey of Columbiana County, Ohio. Field investigations in the current modernization project indicate the till is thinner to the underlying residuum.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na) Ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nb) Argillic horizon - from a depth of 10 to 52 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, 2B't1, 3B't2).\nc) Fragipan - from a depth of 25 to 34 inches (2Btx2).\nd) Aquic conditions - from a depth of 14 to 65 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon CO-150 for characterization data on the typical pedon, sampled numbers 27313-27323, from Columbiana County, Ohio; sample analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
