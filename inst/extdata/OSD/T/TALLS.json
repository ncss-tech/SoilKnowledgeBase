  "OVERVIEW": "The Talls series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash. They are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for more than 60 consecutive days.  The upper part of the profile contains more than 60 percent pyroclastic materials.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 12 to 22 inches.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part.  Content of rock fragments in the lower part ranges from 40 to 60 percent by weighted average.  The lower part of the profile contains 18 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction of the solum is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizons have a hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry or 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.\nThe Bw horizons have a hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. They are ashy silt loam or ashy loam and have weak granular or blocky structure.\nThe 2Bt and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  They range from clay loam to sandy clay loam or heavy loam, are gravelly, cobbly, very gravelly, or very cobbly, and have few layers of laminated silts and clays.  Clay bands range from 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick.  Reaction of the 2C horizons range from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

Oxerine soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  McCree soils are medial-skeletal in the upper part of the particle-size control section, loamy-skeletal in the lower part and average as loamy-skeletal. Newbell soils have sola 10 to 20 inches thick and the B horizon is 5 to 15 percent rock fragments and 8 to 12 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ohscow soils have a solum 24 to 36 inches thick. Threemile soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the control section.  Wilmont soils are dominated by channery rock fragments and are very channery or extremely channery in the particle-size control section."
