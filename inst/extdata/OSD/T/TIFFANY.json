  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section averages fine sandy loam to silt loam with less than 18% clay.  Depth to carbonates commonly ranges from 20 to 50 inches, but is more than 60 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  Hue of 2.5Y and chroma of 2 is allowed in the lower part.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  It typically has redoximorphic features in the lower part.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has redoximorphic features that increase in number and distinctness with depth.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bw or Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has a wide variety of colors due to redoximorphic features and is often stratified.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Loamy, silty and clayey substratum phases are recognized (see REMARKS).  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in these phases."
