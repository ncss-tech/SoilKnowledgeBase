  "OVERVIEW": "The Trahern series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, somewhat poorly drained sodic soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on low terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
