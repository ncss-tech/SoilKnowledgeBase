The soil between the depth of 5 to 20 inches is not dry at any time unless artificially drained.  The weighted average clay content of the texture control section from a depth of 10 inches to the duripan is 35 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/1 or 4/1.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/1.  Distinct or prominent mottles are present in the lower part of the A horizon.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Btn horizon is 2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 6/1, 6/2, 6/3 or 5/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/2; 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 3/2 or 3/3.  The upper part has columnar or prismatic structure with 45 to 60 percent clay, and the exchangeable sodium percentage is 15 to 25 percent.  The lower part has 30 to 40 percent clay.\nWhen a Bk horizon is present, it has similar colors as the Bt horizon.  Clay content is 30 to 40 percent and textures are clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkqm horizon is at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  It is indurated in the upper part and cementation decreases with increasing depth.
