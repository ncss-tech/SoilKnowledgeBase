Thickness of the solum ranges from 9 to 16 inches.  The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay, less than 35 percent rock fragments, and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Colors occur in horizontal or convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt, mucky silt loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizons, when present, have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3, 4, or 5; moist chroma of 2,3, or 4.  Colors occur in horizontal or convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral of mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 3, 4, or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent subangular gravel and 0 to 15 percent subangular cobble.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Tonsina soils have native vegetation of white spruce, quaking aspen, paper birch, and willows.  Most areas have been burned, resulting in the transition from Copper River to Tonsina soils.  The successional state of vegetation in a given area is closely related to the fire history.  Small areas are cleared and used for small grains, grass, and vegetables."
