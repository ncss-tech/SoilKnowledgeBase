  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonsina series consists of well drained soils formed in silty loess over loamy glacial till.  Tonsina soils are on drumlins, till plains, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

Thickness of the solum ranges from 9 to 16 inches.  The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay, less than 35 percent rock fragments, and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Colors occur in horizontal or convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt, mucky silt loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizons, when present, have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3, 4, or 5; moist chroma of 2,3, or 4.  Colors occur in horizontal or convoluted streaks and patches.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral of mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 3, 4, or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.
