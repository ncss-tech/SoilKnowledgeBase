    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The particle-size control section (10- to 40-inch depth) averages fine sandy loam or sandy loam with about 8 to 15 percent clay.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F. Trembles soils are usually moist in some part between 8 and 24 inches during the growing season.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3, and it has weak to strong effervescence.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Textures include fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist. Above a depth of 48 inches it is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with or without thin lenses of loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loamy fine sand. The substratum below a depth of 30 inches is loamy fine sand in some pedons. Textures below a depth of 48 inches range from sand to silt loam.  The C horizon has moderate to strong effervescence. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline above 30 inches and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline below 30 inches.  Few to common redoximorphic features are present below 36 inches in some pedons."

They formed in calcareous, stratified fine sandy loam or sandy loam alluvium. Climate is cool, moist-semiarid, with long, cold, dry winters and moist springs and summers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches, more than 70 percent of which falls during April through October. Mean annual air temperature ranges between 39 and 45 F. Mean January air temperature ranges from 8 to 25 F. and mean July air temperature ranges from 65 to 70 F. The frost-free period ranges from 105 to 135 days and elevation ranges from 1600 to 5000 feet."
