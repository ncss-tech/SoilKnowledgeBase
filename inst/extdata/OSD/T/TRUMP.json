  "OVERVIEW": "The Trump series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone.  Trump soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).",

This pedon is in the adjacent Pike and San Isabel NF, Northern Part soil survey area, and is the typical pedon of the Cheadle Family in that survey. The Trump series name was reactivated in 2009 for use in the Teller-Park soil survey. This series was originally established in 1959 in Chaffee County, Colorado, in the Trout Creek Watershed Area, which is now a part of the soil survey of Pike and San Isabel National Forests, Northern Part. The name is from a townsite in Park County."
