  "REVDATE": "01/2005",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Turlin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces, in drainageways and floodplains, on base slopes and on alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).",
