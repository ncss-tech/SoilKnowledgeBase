Gessner and Waller soils are on the Lissie Formation. Gessner soils are in oval depressions and Waller soils are on flats. In addition, Waller soils are in MLRA 152B (Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods)\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 45 to 95 cm (18 to 38 in)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 45 cm (0 to 18 in) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 45 to 203 cm (18 to 80 in) (Bt and Btg horizons)\nEpisaturation: 0 to 77 cm (0 to 30 in) (A, E and Bt1 horizons)\nAquic conditions: 0 to 45 cm (0 to 18 in)\nAdditional Comments: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by MLRA soil survey office laboratory data number on pedon S2018TX4734889 from the type location in Waller County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from type location S2018TX4734889.
