  "OVERVIEW": "The Tomball series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Willis Formation. These nearly level soils occur in open ended depressions on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F).",
