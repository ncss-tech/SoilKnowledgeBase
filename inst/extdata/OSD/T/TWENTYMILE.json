  "OVERVIEW": "The Twentymile series consists of moderately deep to dense till, soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick.  These soils are on north-facing backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of glaciated mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
