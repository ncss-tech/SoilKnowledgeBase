These soils are usually moist, but are dry for less than 45 days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to dense till is 20 to 35 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 3 to 10 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has values of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chromas of 1 or 2 dry.  It is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is ashy fine sandy loam or stony ashy fine sandy loam.
