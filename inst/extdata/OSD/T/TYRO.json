  "OVERVIEW": "The Tyro series consists of very shallow and shallow over duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils on pediments.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches.   The mean annual air temperature is about 74 degrees F.",
