  "OVERVIEW": "The Toddspan series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone and shale.  Toddspan soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
