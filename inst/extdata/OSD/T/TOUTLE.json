A similar soil\nin a different subgroup:  Chelan are moderately coarse\ntextured soils over very gravelly coarse sandy loam and have\na very dark grayish brown Mollic epipedon.  A similar soil\nin a different order:  Pilchuck soils have an Ochric\nepipedon and contain little or no pumice material."
