  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Teebar series consists of very shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Teebar soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.",
