Bacobi, Kiki, Neiber and Saddle soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.\nFrisite, Fruitvale, Grazane, Griffy, Neiber, Redlands, and Starmountain soils lack very gravelly substrata. Papoose soils are drier during the summer and lack granitic pebbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tijeras soils are on nearly level to gently rolling fan remnants at elevations of 4500 to 6500 feet.  They formed in sandy to medium textured sediments of mixed origin; many of the sediments were derived from decomposing granitic rocks.  The climate is semiarid continental inches with a marked summer maximum characterized by frequent heavy thunderstorms of short duration.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F."

Brazito soils lack argillic horizons and are coarser than loamy very fine sand throughout the control section. Tesajo soils have mollic epipedons and average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section."
