  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Texture of the A1 horizon ranges from silt loam to loamy fine sand, and thickness ranges from 1 to 6 inches.  Texture of the C horizon ranges from very fine sand to stratified silt loam; very fine sand, and fine sand. The C horizon may be streaked with olive brown and dark brown. Depth to the calcareous horizon commonly ranges from 20 to 40 inches, but frequently flooded areas may have calcareous sediments on the surface. A gravelly substratum may occur at depths greater than 30 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Susitna series of the same family, the Charley and Salchaket series of the same subgroup, and the Kuslina and Yukon series. The Susitna soils are developed in noncalcareous alluvial materials. The Charley soils are silty and calcareous. The Salchaket soils are developed in micaceous stratified materials.  The Kuslina soils are poorly drained with permafrost at depths of less than 30 inches, and are acid. The Yukon soils are finer textured, are somewhat poorly drained with permafrost, and are calcareous within 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Takotna soils occur on floodplains of major rivers in interior Alaska, and are formed in stratified alluvium. They are associated with soils with permafrost, but are not perennially frozen themselves. The climate is subarctic continental, with long cold winters and short warm summers.  Precipitation is low to moderate."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Yukon series, and the Kuskokwim, McGrath, Napamute, Koyukuk, Kaltag, Charley, and Rampart series. The Kuskokwim soils have thick peaty 0 horizons and have permafrost at very shallow depths.  The other soils are developed in loess on adjacent uplands. The McGrath soils have spodic horizons. The Napamute soils have dark gray and dark reddish brown colors in the solum.  The Koyukuk soils have brown sola. The Kaltag soils have streaked brown and gray colors. The Charley soils have streaked brownish colors and are calcareous. The Rampart soils have thin brown sola and are calcareous below the solum."
