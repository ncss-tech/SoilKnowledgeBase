  "OVERVIEW": "Tongue River soils consist of moderately deep, that formed in colluvium and/or slide deposits over residuum weathered from interbedded shale, siltstone and sandstone.  Tongue River soils are on escarpments, hills, mountain slopes and landslides.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
