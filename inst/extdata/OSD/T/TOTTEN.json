  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to coarse sand typically is 22 to 30 inches but ranges from 14 to 40 inches. Typically the A and Bt horizons contain a few pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It typically is loam, but some is silt loam or sandy loam.  It contains some salts and ranges from slight to strong effervescence.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 when mixed.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features with hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR and chroma of 1 to 6 are in the interior of the prisms in most pedons.  The Btn horizon typically is sandy clay loam but some is loam or clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy loam.  The lower boundary of the Bt or Bk horizon commonly is very irregular or tongues into the 2C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The 2C horizon typically is coarse sand containing 10 to 40 percent by volume of fine gravel, but some are stratified and contain layers of coarse and medium sand and gravel.  Some pedons contain sand and gravel composed of shale channers.  Glacial till is within depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Totten soils are on nearly level, slightly depressed areas on outwash plains, and channels.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in loamy material overlying stratified sand and sand and gravel glacial alluvium.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 20 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Arveson, Borup, Divide and Marysland soils do not have Bt horizons and have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  Arvilla, Binford, Brantford, Kensal, Osakis, Walum and Warsing soils are on nearby outwash plains on higher topographic positions.  They are moderately well to somewhat excessively drained and none have Bt horizons.  Stirum soils are on similar positions.  They are coarse-loamy."

Permeability is moderately slow or slow in the solum and rapid in the substratum.  The water table is at depths of less than 24 inches in the spring and during periods of above average precipitation."
