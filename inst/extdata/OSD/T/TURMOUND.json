    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were mapped as Waukena in the Los Banos Area, Series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated by having an aquic moisture regime and tonguing of albic material in the upper Bt horizon.  pH determined by colormetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Soluble salts and exchangeable sodium determined by saturation extract.  Organic matter estimated by comparing with adjacent soils determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Presence of lime determined with 10 percent HC1.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET"
