    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated with stagnant water for at least a few days in most years.  Uncoated sand grains (Tonguing of albic materials) are down into the part of 2Btn1.  The 2Btn1 has more than 1.2 times clay content of An2 horizon.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/1, 5/1 or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/1, 3/2 or 4/2.  Thickness ranges from 7 to 24 inches depending on topography.  Reaction is strongly alkaline except the top 3 inches of which ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Typically there is more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium between 3 to 13 inches, ranging from 15 to 43 percent.  EC is 8 to 16 mmhos/cm.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 6/6; 2.5Y 4/4; 5Y 4/3 or 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4; or 5Y 5/3.  Texture is sandy clay loam or rarely clay loam. Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 45 percent.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay content.  EC is 8 to 16 mmhos/cm.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2; or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 6/2; 2.5Y 4/4; 5Y 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Textures are sandy clay loam, clay loam, clay, silty clay loam or loam and clay content ranges from 25 to 45 percent.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 45 percent.  EC is 8 to 16 mmhos/cm."

These soils are formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from granitic rock.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were mapped as Waukena in the Los Banos Area, Series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated by having an aquic moisture regime and tonguing of albic material in the upper Bt horizon.  pH determined by colormetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Soluble salts and exchangeable sodium determined by saturation extract.  Organic matter estimated by comparing with adjacent soils determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Presence of lime determined with 10 percent HC1.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
