In some places, mainly on stream terraces, gravelly substrata are below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data from 4 profiles of Thurman soils is provided on pages 183-189 of Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 5.  \"Soil Survey Laboratory Data and Descriptions for Some Soils of Nebraska\"\nModified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\n9/24/2008 NAD Added dry to follow dry colors in the RIC. Expanded range of A horizon value to include Value 4 moist as this is common to have a thin layer in cropped fields. Added statement in RIC A horizon to state that mixing the upper 25 cm the color requirement for a mollic epipedon is still met. Added LRR to distribution and extent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
