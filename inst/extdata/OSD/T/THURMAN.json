  "OVERVIEW": "The Thurman series consists of very deep somewhat excessively drained soils that formed mainly in sandy eolian material. They are on uplands and stream terraces and have slopes that range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 64 centimeters (25 inches) at the type location.",

Expanded range of A horizon value to include Value 4 moist as this is common to have a thin layer in cropped fields. Added statement in RIC A horizon to state that mixing the upper 25 cm the color requirement for a mollic epipedon is still met. Added LRR to distribution and extent."
