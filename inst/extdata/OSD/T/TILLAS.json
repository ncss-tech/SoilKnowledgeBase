Elevations are 4 to 82 meters (13 to 269 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 1778 to 2286 millimeters (70 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 275 to 325 days."

Hookton soils are somewhat poorly drained and have redoximorphic features from 25 to 100 centimeters deep.  Weott soils are poorly drained and have redoximorphic features from 6 to 10 centimeters deep. Carlotta soils are found on fluvial terraces. Hookton soils are found on wetter areas of alluvial fans.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 93 centimeters. (Ap1,Ap2,and Ap3 horizons)\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 112 to 200 centimeters. (Bw, Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters, averages 33 percent clay, 23 percent fine sand and coarser, by weight,and 10 percent rock fragments, by volume. (Ap1, Ap2, Ap3, and Bw horizons)\nTillas soils do not have a diagnostic argillic horizon. Clay films are present in most surface horizons but lack a clay increase in the upper subsurface due to agricultural related mixing of the upper 100 centimeters of the soil.\nUnder native forest vegetation this soil has an isomesic soil temperature regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNSSL, Lincoln Lab sample 08N0240\nNASIS User Pedon ID 07-CA605-175\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  In 2012 the classification was changed from Fluventic Humic Dystrudepts to Cumulic Humudepts to reflect the changes in Taxonomy and to better reflect lab data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
