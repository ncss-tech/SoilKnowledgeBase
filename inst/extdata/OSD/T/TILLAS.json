    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 93 centimeters. (Ap1,Ap2,and Ap3 horizons)\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 112 to 200 centimeters. (Bw, Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters, averages 33 percent clay, 23 percent fine sand and coarser, by weight,and 10 percent rock fragments, by volume. (Ap1, Ap2, Ap3, and Bw horizons)\nTillas soils do not have a diagnostic argillic horizon. Clay films are present in most surface horizons but lack a clay increase in the upper subsurface due to agricultural related mixing of the upper 100 centimeters of the soil.\nUnder native forest vegetation this soil has an isomesic soil temperature regime."
