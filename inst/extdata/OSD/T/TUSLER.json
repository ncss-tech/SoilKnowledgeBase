  "OVERVIEW": "The Tusler series consists of somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that are moderately deep to weakly consolidated sandstone bedrock.  They formed in sandy materials weathered from calcareous soft sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary uplands and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 12 inches.",

Depth to carbonates is 0 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand.  It is calcareous with carbonates diffuse or segregated in seams or masses.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is calcareous, weakly consolidated soft sandstone that crushes to loamy fine sand or fine sand.  It typically is massive or platy, and hard and brittle when dry.  Some pedons have soft layers and a few have layers of very hard sandstone."

Absher, Ladner and Zeona soils are very deep to paralithic beds and are on more gentle slopes than the Tusler soils.  In addition, Absher and Ladner soils have natric horizons.  Cabbart and Fleak soils are shallow to paralithic beds.  In addition, Cabbart soils are loamy.  Cabbart soils are on nearby uplands.  Fleak soils are on convex slopes above the Tusler soils.  Rhame soils are coarse-loamy.  They are on nearby uplands."
