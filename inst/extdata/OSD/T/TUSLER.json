  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.  Depth to carbonates is 0 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand.  It is calcareous with carbonates diffuse or segregated in seams or masses.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is calcareous, weakly consolidated soft sandstone that crushes to loamy fine sand or fine sand.  It typically is massive or platy, and hard and brittle when dry.  Some pedons have soft layers and a few have layers of very hard sandstone."

Beisigl, Blanchard, Kenray, Seroco and Yecross soils are more moist in the moisture control section.  In addition, Blanchard, Kenray, Seroco, Yecross, Yetull and Zeona soils do not have a paralithic contact within 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in calcareous soft sandstone.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Zeona soils and the Absher, Cabbart, Fleak, Ladner and Rhame soils.  Absher, Ladner and Zeona soils are very deep to paralithic beds and are on more gentle slopes than the Tusler soils.  In addition, Absher and Ladner soils have natric horizons.  Cabbart and Fleak soils are shallow to paralithic beds.  In addition, Cabbart soils are loamy.  Cabbart soils are on nearby uplands.  Fleak soils are on convex slopes above the Tusler soils.  Rhame soils are coarse-loamy.  They are on nearby uplands."
