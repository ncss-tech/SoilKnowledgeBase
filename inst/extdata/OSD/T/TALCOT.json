  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the upper mantle ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are in the upper mantle range from 0 to 10 percent.  The 2C horizon has 10 to 40 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 24 inches in thickness.  The upper mantle averages between 30 and 35 percent clay and 15 to about 40 percent of fine sand and coarser.  The calcium carbonate equivalent averages between about 5 and 15 percent.  The upper mantle ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline but the lower part of the B horizon in some pedons is neutral.  Few to many limy shell fragments are common in some part of the A horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 2 or is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  However, it has subhorizons with chroma higher than 2 in the lower part of some pedons.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, but it is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam in the lower part of some pedons.  Transitional layers of sandy loam are less than 5 inches thick.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y with value and chroma of 2 to 6. It is stratified coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or their gravelly analoques.."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Talcot soils have concave or plane slopes on stream terraces and glacial outwash plains.  They have slopes of less than 2 percent.  They formed in glacial outwash consisting of a 24 to 40- nch loamy mantle over sandy or sandy-skeletal sediments.  These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 32 inches.   Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.\nFrost free days range from 145 to 160.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 1,250 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The main ones are the Biscay, Cylinder, Fairhaven, and Wadena soils which formed in materials similar to those of the Talcot soils.  Well drained Fairhaven and Wadena and somewhat poorly drained Cylinder soils have higher lying or more sloping landscapes.  Poorly and very poorly drained Biscay soils have landscapes similar to Talcot soils but lack free carbonates in the 10- to 20-inch depth zone.  All of the associated soils are Mollisols."

Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  Seasonal high saturation occurs at or near the surface in spring during normal years."

The native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Bluejoint Grasses, Fowl Bluegrasses, Green Muhlies, Fox Sedges, Field Sedges, Dudleys Rushes, Torreys Rushes, Swamp Milkweeds, False Sneezeweeds, False Asters, New England Asters, White Panicled Asters, and Wild Mints."
