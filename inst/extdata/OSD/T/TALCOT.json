  "OVERVIEW": "The Talcot series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in glacial outwash consisting of a 24 to 40 inch thick loamy mantle over sandy or sandy-skeletal sediments.  These soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces.  They have moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part.  They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 48 degrees F.",

The 2C horizon has 10 to 40 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 24 inches in thickness.  The upper mantle averages between 30 and 35 percent clay and 15 to about 40 percent of fine sand and coarser.  The calcium carbonate equivalent averages between about 5 and 15 percent.  The upper mantle ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline but the lower part of the B horizon in some pedons is neutral.  Few to many limy shell fragments are common in some part of the A horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 2 or is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  However, it has subhorizons with chroma higher than 2 in the lower part of some pedons.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, but it is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam in the lower part of some pedons.  Transitional layers of sandy loam are less than 5 inches thick.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y with value and chroma of 2 to 6. It is stratified coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or their gravelly analoques.."

They formed in glacial outwash consisting of a 24 to 40- nch loamy mantle over sandy or sandy-skeletal sediments.  These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 32 inches.   Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.\nFrost free days range from 145 to 160.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 1,250 feet."

Well drained Fairhaven and Wadena and somewhat poorly drained Cylinder soils have higher lying or more sloping landscapes.  Poorly and very poorly drained Biscay soils have landscapes similar to Talcot soils but lack free carbonates in the 10- to 20-inch depth zone.  All of the associated soils are Mollisols."
