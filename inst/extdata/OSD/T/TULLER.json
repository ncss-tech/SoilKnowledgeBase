  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly flat. The volume commonly ranges from 15 to 35 percent by weighted average of the subsoil and substratum but the range include 10 percent. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, values of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Many pedons in forested areas have 0 horizons 1 to 3 inches thick and A horizons 2 to 4 inches thick.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3 and chroma of faces of peds of 2 or less. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate medium and fine subangular blocky, moderate medium prismatic or platy. Consistence is friable or firm.\nA thin C horizon that is massive or has plate-like divisions occurs in some pedons.\nThe 2R horizon ranges from massive sandstone to interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale bedrock. It is reddish, olive or gray in color."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Topnot and Tor series are similar soils in related families. Topknot soils are nonacid. Tor soils are frigid and loamy-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tuller soils occur dominantly on long, narrow areas on hillsides and flatter hilltops that are often bordered by bedrock outcrops. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The regolith is principally a thin mantle of till dominated by material derived from acid sandstone, siltstone and thin beds of shale. The climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 35 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.; and the frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 600 to 1750 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Tuller soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Arnot soils. Chippewa, Ellery, Erie, Greene, Lordstown, Morris, Norwich, Oquaga and Volusia soils are landscape associates in comparable but deeper till deposits over bedrock."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly forested or idle or used for growing pasture and hay. Forest vegetation is dominantly maple, beech, elm, oak and hemlock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In about one-third of the areas where the Tuller soils have been correlated the particle-size control section is border-line to loamy-skeletal. In these areas rock fragment content exceeds 35 percent by only a small amount. Original classification placed Tuller in the great group of Haplaquepts. Because of changes established in the 5th edition of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Endoaquepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Cambic horizon - from 6 to 18 inches (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\n3) Aquic moisture conditions - as evidenced by low chroma (2 or less) matrix colors and redoximorphic features within 20 inches of the soil surface (Bg horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
