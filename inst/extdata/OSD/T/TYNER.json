Acquango, Bigapple, Caesar, Chute, Hodge, Pahuk, Penwood, Perks, Pinegrove, Suncook, and Windsor soils are less than 91 cm (36 inches) to the base of the solum. Aldo soils have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the series control section. Biltmore and Ronda soils contain mica flakes throughout the series control section. Boplain soils have a paralithic contact between 51 and 102 cm (20 and 40 inches). Breeze soils formed in anthrotransported material and have 10 percent rock fragments consisting of construction debris. Dabney soils have a dry value of 5 or less in the upper part of the series control section. Gardiner soils are in areas that receive more than 1016 mm (40 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Oakville, Plainfield, Sardak, and Sarpy soils have less than 10 percent silt plus clay in the particle-size control section. Osolo soils average more than 50 percent fine and very fine sand in the particle-size control section. Poquonock soils have a densic contact within the series control section. Samoa soils do not have a Bw horizon. Spessard soils formed in colluvium from acid sandstone. Wapanucket soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section."
