  "OVERVIEW": "The Threetrees series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist or phyllite rock types.  Threetrees soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 145 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
