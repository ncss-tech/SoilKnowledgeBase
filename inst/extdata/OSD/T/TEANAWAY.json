  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Teanaway soils are on terraces, terrace escarpments and foothills. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. These soils formed in loess over glacial till (Kittitas Drift) with a minor influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations are l,800 to 2,500 feet. These soils are in a climate with warm, moderately dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 145 to 175 days and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."

More study is necessary to determine whether the horizon is dense from compaction or weakly cemented or both.\nType location, classification and the modal concept revised 04/1999. This series is recognized only in Kittitas County. This series would qualify for an Oxyaquic subgroup if available to use within Haploxeralfs.\nThis soil is recognized on the Lakedale, Kittitas, and Indian John geomorphic surfaces in Kittitas County, Washington.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for this soil.
