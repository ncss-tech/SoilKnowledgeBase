  "OVERVIEW": "The Tomel series consists of shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale, siltstone, limestone, chert, and interbedded quartz.  Tomel soils are on fan remnants, fan piedmonts and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
