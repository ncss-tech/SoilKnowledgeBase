The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and may include the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The particle-size control section averages is 18 to 30 percent clay (estimated).  Base saturation is 60 to 70 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches of the solum.  The upper 20 to 30 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.0 to 1.2 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  Depth to extremely gravelly or cobbly horizons is greater than 60 inches.  In some pedons there is a weakly cemented duripan below 60 inches.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has 2 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  It has 18 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam and has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."
