  "OVERVIEW": "The Turley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed from alluvium and eolian materials derived from sandstone and shale.  Turley soils are on terraces, fan remnants, and alluvial fans and have slope of 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - zone from the surface to 3 inches.(A horizon)\nEntisol feature - Lack of diagnostic horizons and features.\nThis series has been mapped too broadly in New Mexico.  In New Mexico it occurs in both the typic aridic-no big sagebrush zone and the ustic aridic-big sagebrush zone.  In any future update those Turley components that occur in the ustic aridic-big sagebrush areas should be correlated to another series.  The central concept for this soil is now one of a typic aridic soil moisture regime lacking big sagebrush.  The current profile appears very close to having a cambic horizon, thus possibly classifying as a Typic Haplocambid.  The original author apparently did not think the secondary carbonates were pedogenic and described them as Ck rather than Bk horizons.  Until the type location can be revisited to confirm a cambic with Bk horizons the subgroup will remain as Typic Torriorthents.  The classification was changed from fine-loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents to fine-loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents 8/2004.\nThe active cation exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils derived in similar parent materials."
