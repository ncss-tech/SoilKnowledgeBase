    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle is 14 to 20 inches thick. The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples, and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.   The lower part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has 0 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand and is 0 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tunkcreek soils are on outwash terraces, mountain toeslopes, and mountain footslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in glacial outwash, mainly of granitic origin, with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Elevations range from 3,500 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 22 to 28 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 20 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."

Buhrig soils are loamy-skeletal and moderately deep to bedrock.  Manley soils are medial over loamy-skeletal.  Merkel soils are frigid and loamy-skeletal.  Resner soils are medial over sandy-skeletal. Scrabblers soils are frigid.  Stapaloop soils are coarse-loamy and frigid.  Torboy soils are frigid and lack a volcanic ash mantle."

The native overstory vegetation is subalpine fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce. The understory consists of pachystima, dwarf huckleberry, longtube twinflower, common princes-pine, pinegrass, kinnikinnick, white spiraea, and Virginia strawberry."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were proposed as the Tunk series 9/85.  The name is changed to prevent confusion with the established Trunk series.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are an ochric epipedon from 1.5 to 2 inches composed of volcanic ash (Mt. St. Helens 'T' or'W' layer), a cambic horizon from 2 to 17 inches that has andic soil properties and a lithologic break to sandy glacial outwash at 17 inches.  The description reflects a change in classification from mixed to glassy over mixed mineralogy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
