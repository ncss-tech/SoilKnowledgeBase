  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; runoff is negligible due to the depressional feature of the wind-tidal flats.  Permeability is rapid above the high water table, but the overall permeability class is very slow.  A permanent water table fluctuates between the surfaces to about 23 cm (9 in).  These soils are very frequently flooded for long periods with salt water, which occur during times of high wind that pushes water onto the wind-tidal flats, storm surge, and heavy rains associated with tropical storms."

Halophytic vegetation consisting of saltwort and glasswort occur for short periods after inundation.  The surface salinity rises as the surface dries, and eventually becomes toxic to the plants.  The ecological site is Wind Tidal Flat, PE 31-44 (150BY716TX)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The series type location was moved from the Ingleside Barrier strand plain in Aransas County to the barrier island in Willacy County in 2004.  Areas mapped as Tatton in Kenedy, Kleberg and Willacy are similar, while those in Aransas County vary.  The classification was changed in December, 2004 from Typic Psammaquents to Sodic Psammaquents based on application of the 9th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy and field investigations during the mapping of Padre Island National Seashore.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (Anz, Anzg, Cnzg1, Cnzg2, Cnzg3, and Cnzg4 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 in). (Anz and Anzg horizons)\nEndosaturation: The zone of saturation at 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (Anz, Anzg, Cnzg1, Cnzg2, Cnzg3, and Cnzg4 horizons)\nAquic conditions: These soils remain saturated and have reducing conditions for at least one month in most years from 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data by the project staff exists on the typical pedon from Willacy County.  Particle-size analysis on three pedons, and salinity and sodicity tests on five pedons performed at the soil survey project office.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
