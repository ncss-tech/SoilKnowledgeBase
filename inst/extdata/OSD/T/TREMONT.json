  "OVERVIEW": "The Tremont series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in two distinct layers of loamy alluvium on flood plains. They are underlain below a depth of 102 to 183 cm (40 to 72 inches) by gravelly sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

The very poorly drained Lippincott soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying calcareous gravelly and sandy outwash. They are on adjacent terraces. The well drained Ross soils commonly are on higher positions than Tremont soils or are nearer to stream channels. The very poorly drained Sloan soils typically are in lower positions than Tremont soils, or are farther from stream channels."
