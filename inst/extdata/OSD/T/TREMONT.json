    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. In a closely related family are the Havelock and Millington series. These soils are in the superactive cation-exchange activity class. In addition, Havelock soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 91 cm (36 inches). Millington soils do not have a buried soil (Ab horizon) within the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tremont soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loamy calcareous alluvium washed from soils formed in drift of late Wisconsinan glaciation. They are underlain by gravelly sediments below a depth of 102 to 183 cm (40 to 72 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degree F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lippincott, Ross, and Sloan soils. The very poorly drained Lippincott soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying calcareous gravelly and sandy outwash. They are on adjacent terraces. The well drained Ross soils commonly are on higher positions than Tremont soils or are nearer to stream channels. The very poorly drained Sloan soils typically are in lower positions than Tremont soils, or are farther from stream channels."

Permeability is moderate. Tremont soils are subject to rare or occasional flooding during late fall to spring."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

Native vegetation is scattered deciduous forest with prairie grasses. Sycamore, ash, elm, beech, maple and walnut were the principal woodland species."
