  "OVERVIEW": "The Tafoya series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium.  These soils are on foothills and mountain slopes and have slopes ranging from 9 to 45 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
