  "OVERVIEW": "The Tekenink series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy loam till. These soils are on ground moraines, recessional moraines, or end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees (48 degrees F).",
