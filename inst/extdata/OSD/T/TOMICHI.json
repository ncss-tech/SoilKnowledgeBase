    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Tomichi soils lack cambic horizons or characteristics of the mollic epipedon that are equivalent to cambic horizons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.  The soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent but typically is more than 80 percent.  The fine earth in the control section is loamy sand or sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are typically less than 3 inches in diameter.  The A and C horizons range from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR."

Slope gradients typically range from 2 to about 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial parent materials, glacial outwash, or coarse textured glacial deposits.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 31 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 52 degrees F."
