  "OVERVIEW": "The Ticino series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Ticino soils are on hillsides and have slopes of 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
