  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact of soft massive or laminar, weathered siltstone. The mean annual soil temperature is 51 degrees to 58 degrees F.; the mean January soil temperature is 35 degrees to 39 degrees F.; and the mean July soil temperature is 64 degrees to 79 degrees F. from March 1 to January 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from March 25 to November 25. The soil is dry fn most years between the depths of 4 and 12 inches from mid-July through mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. Rock fragments range from O to 35 percent throughout the solum and are mostly gravel. The A horizon is olive gray, olive, light olive gray, pale olive, grayish brown or light brownish gray (5Y 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2). Moist colors are dark grayish brown, olive gray, or olive (2.5Y 4/2; 5Y 4/2, 4/3). It is silt loam or silty clay loam and most pedons are stony.\nThis horizon has 20 to 35 percent clay. It has less than 1 percent organic matter. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2t horizon ranges from grayish brown to pale olive (lOYR and 5Y 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4). Moist colors range from very dark grayish brown to olive (lOYR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 215Y 3/2, 3/4, 4/2, 4/4, 5/4; 5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4). It is silty clay loam or silty clay with 27 to 50 percent clay but the top 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 35 to 50 percent clay. There is at least 6 percent increase in clay from the A horizon to the B2t horizon. When dry, cracks 1/8 to 1/2 inch wide occur but do not continue to the soil surface. Very few to many, fine to large slickensides are in the lower part of the B2t horizon. It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe B3t horizon has similar color ranges as the B2t horizon, but has rock fragments in amounts of 15 to 35 percent. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Terwilliger soils are on hills and uplands. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The soils forms in colluvium and materials weathered from siltstone of the Hornbrook formation that have a large amount of argillaceous sediment. Rock fragments consisting mostly of cobbles and stones occupy O to 10 percent of the soil surface.  Elevations are 2,200 to 3,500 feet. The climate is continental and sub-humid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. Seasonal snowfall is 8 to 36 inches.  Mean January temperature is 32 degrees to 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 67 degrees to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 48 degrees to 52 degrees F. Frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Hilt and Mary soils have a fine-loamy control section. Kuck soils have a mollic epipedon and cracks that extend to the soil surface. Lassen soils have clay texture, slickensides that intersect, and wide cracks that extend to the surface. Salisbury soils have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches and hue of lOYR or 7.5YR."
