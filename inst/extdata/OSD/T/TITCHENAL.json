These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 25 inches thick and can include the upper part of the Bt horizon. Base saturation is 60 to 75 percent in the lower part of the mollic epipedon. Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 10 to 18 percent and there is less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Depth to the duripan is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. It is neutral or slightly alkaline increasing with depth. Base saturation is 75 to 90 percent.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon is weakly to moderately cemented. When crushed, the duripan textures to gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly fine sandy loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 15 percent."
