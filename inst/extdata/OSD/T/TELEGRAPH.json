    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Telegraph soils are on linear to slightly convex positions on backslopes of mountains. Slopes are from 30 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 185 to 505 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days."
