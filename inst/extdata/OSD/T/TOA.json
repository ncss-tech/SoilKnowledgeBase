Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the Ap and A horizons, and from neutral to slightly alkaline in the Bw, BC, and C horizons.  Organic carbon does not decrease regularly with depth.  Less than 15 percent, by volume, pebbles in the A, Ap, AB, BA, Bw and BC horizons and 20 to 80 percent, by volume, in the 2C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe AB or BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown range from none to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam, silty clay loam or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.    Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and red range from few to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or sandy clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC or C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, red and gray range from few to many.

Bajura, Coloso, and Dique soils lack mollic epipedons.  In addition, Bajura soils are poorly drained, Coloso soils are somewhat poorly drained, and Dique soils have fine-loamy control sections.  The excessively drained Reilly soils have sandy-skeletal control sections.  The somewhat excessively drained Vivi soils have coarse-loamy control sections."
