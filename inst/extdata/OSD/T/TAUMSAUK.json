Stones, boulders and associated rock outcrop occupy from 0.1 to 50 percent of the soil surface.  Rock fragment content in the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is cobbly silt loam, very cobbly silt loam, very channery silt loam, gravelly silt loam or very gravelly silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to extremely acid.\nThe Bt1 or BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, extremely channery, or very cobbly analogs of silt loam or clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is very cobbly, extremely cobbly, extremely channery, or very gravelly analogues of silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Taumsauk soils are on convex side slopes of mountain ridges. The position is commonly on back slopes or shoulder slopes, but may be on undulating summits.  Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent. These soils formed in colluvium or residuum weathered from rhyolite or felsite.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."
