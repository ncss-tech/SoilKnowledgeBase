  "OVERVIEW": "The Tubac series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Tubac soils are on fan terraces and basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
