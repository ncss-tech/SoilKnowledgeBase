  "STATES": "NV,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tarnach series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, and residuum derived from limestone, calcareous sandstone, rhyolite and tuffaceous siltstone.  Tarnach soils are on mountains, hills, and rock pediments.  Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
