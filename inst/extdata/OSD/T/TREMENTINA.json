  "OVERVIEW": "The Trementina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Trementina soils are on terraces and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches (330 to 460 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 48 to 53 degrees F (9 to 12 degrees C).",
