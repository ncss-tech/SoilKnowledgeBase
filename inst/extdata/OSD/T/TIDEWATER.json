  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. JDS, AGH",
  "REVDATE": "09/2002",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tidewater series consists of deep and very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that are inundated by high tides.  They formed in clayey and loamy marine sediments in tidal marshes along the Gulf Coast of northern peninsular Florida.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Average silt content is less than 15 percent in the control section.  Total sulfur content is 0.75 percent or greater within 20 inches of the upper boundary of the A horizon.  Reaction before drying ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.   Texture is clay, silty clay, clay loam, sandy clay, sandy clay loam, or fine sandy loam, as well as the mucky analogues of these textures.  Silty or clayey textures occur in the upper parts of the A horizon only.   A Oa horizon is at the surface or buried at a shallow depth in many pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is muck.  Thickness of the Oa horizon ranges from 0 to 15 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is dominantly sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam, however textures of sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand are below a depth of 40 inches in many pedons.  Lenses of sandy or organic soil materials are buried within the A or C horizons of many pedons.  Limestone bedrock is at depths of 40 to 80 inches in many pedons."

All of these soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Turnbull soils do not have sulfidic material within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface."

In addition, Demory soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.  Durbin and Tisonia soils have an organic surface layer that is greater than 16 inches thick.  Capers soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section."
