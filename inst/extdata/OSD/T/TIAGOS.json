  "OVERVIEW": "The Tiagos series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately coarse textured noncalcareous sediments derived from a variety of rock sources. These soils are on alluvial fans, glacial outwash terraces, glacial moraines, eskers, and till plains. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

Burgess and Greenhalgh soils have a lithic contact above a depth of 100 cm.  Ethelman soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 100 cm.  Scriver soils are mainly slightly and moderately acid and have a B2t horizon in which silicate clay is accumulating as lamellae."
