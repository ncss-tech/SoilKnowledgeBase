    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  ESP ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above a depth of 50 inches and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral pr mildly alkaline. The B2t horizon ha8 hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is typically sandy loam but averages 8 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically sandy loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, sand from 50 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Basgel soils have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation and are calcareous above a depth of 40 inches.  Boulder soils have noncontrasting sandy-skeletal substratums above a depth of 40 inches and have more than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the solum.  Burgess and Greenhalgh soils have a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Ethelman soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Scriver soils are mainly slightly and medium acid and have a B2t horizon in which silicate clay is accumulating as lamellae."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tiagos soils are on alluvial fans, glacial outwash terraces, glacial moraines, eskers, and till plains.  Slopes typically range from 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in moderately coarse textured noncalcareous parent sediments derived from a variety of rock sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 56 degrees F."
