Tezinie soils formed in stratified alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from Cretaceous and Tertiary shale and sandstone. Thin, locally derived deposits of eolian material are present in some areas. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,200 to  5,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches with high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F. The average frost-free period is  150 to 180 days."
