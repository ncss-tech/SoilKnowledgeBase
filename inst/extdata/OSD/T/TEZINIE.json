  "OVERVIEW": "The Tezinie series consists of very deep, well drained, saline-sodic affected soils that formed in alluvium, stream alluvium, and fan alluvium derived from shale, and sandstone. Tezinie soils are on terraces and flood-plain steps. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are typically 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
