The soils formed in alluvial sediments derived primarily from limestone and silty shale.  The climate is semiarid continental.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 10 inches with over 1/2 of the total falling in June through September.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 14.  The frost free season is 170 to 200 days."
