  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tome soils are on broad slightly concave alluvial fans and upland drainages.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 2 percent ranging to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial sediments derived primarily from limestone and silty shale.  The climate is semiarid continental.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 10 inches with over 1/2 of the total falling in June through September.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 14.  The frost free season is 170 to 200 days."
