  "REVDATE": "07/2008",
  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tubbs Hollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from red sandstone or red siltstone. Tubbs Hollow soils are on mountain backslopes, summits and shoulders. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
