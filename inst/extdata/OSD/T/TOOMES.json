  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Auburn, Jennylind, Millsholm, and Spinnaker soils. Auburn soils form on hills in material weathered from metavolcanic and metasedimentary rock. Jennylind soils form on erosion remnants in acidic rhyolitic tuff. Millsholm soils form on hills and mountains from sandstone, mudstone, and shale .     Spinnaker soils form on mountains and hills on islands, and are dry from about August through November."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toomes soils are on plateaus and ridges of volcanic flows and on foothills of volcanic uplands. These soils formed in residuum weathered from tuff breccia and in some areas, from    latite, basalt and andesite. Rock outcrops and stones make up 5 to 50 percent of the surface area.   Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 45 to 1220 meters (150 to 4000 ft). The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 405 to 1305 mm (16 to 40 in). Mean annual temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F); average January temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F); and average July temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F). The frost-free season is 215 to 365 days."

Amador and Pentz soils form on hills in tuff and have a paralithic contact. Guenoc, Inks, Iron Mountain, and Supan soils occur on similar landforms and parent materials as Toomes, but have an argillic horizon. Los Posas soils form on hills in intrusive basic igneous rocks (i.e. gabbro) and have an argillic horizon with a 2.5YR hue. Tuscan soils are on fan remnants and have a duripan ."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in). (A1 and A2 horizon)\nCambic horizon: 18 to 38 cm (7 to 15 in). (Bw horizon)\nLithic contact: 38 cm (15 in). (R horizon)\nParticle size control section for this pedon: 25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 in)\nHistorical notes:\nThe redder hues are associated with basalt and the yellower hues are associated with tuff breccia. The clay increase from the A horizon to the B horizon is less than 3 percent.\nThe Toomes soils were formerly classified as Lithosols. Soils excluded from the series concept and mapped as Toomes in Eastern Fresno Area are loamy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Lithic Xerorthents. Those mapped in Glenn County Area are loamy-skeletal, mixed thermic Lithic Haploxerolls.  Soils mapped in Sonoma County are loamy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Lithic Xerorthents.  Properties of those soils mapped in Eastern Stanislaus Area where not considered in this revision because the soils are of minor extent (155ac.)\nFurther study is needed to determine if the Toomes soils mapped in scattered locations throughout California meet the current concept of Toomes. Soils mapped as Toomes in Antelope Valley Area and Northern Santa Barbara Area should be considered taxadjuncts to the series.\nThose soils mapped as Exchequer in the Placer County Area and as Toomes in Shasta Area but with different classification meet the current concept of Toomes and they should be classified as the official series (see complete characterization for Placer County pedon numbers S61 Calif-31-1 and S61 Calif-31-2).\nEdits made after SDJR project,AEC 3/18\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: S1955-CA-52-109\nPedon Type: OSD pedon\nPedon Purpose: laboratory sampling site\nLab Pedon #: UCD5552109\nLab Source ID: UCDAVIS\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
