  "OVERVIEW": "The Tallac series consists of deep and very deep moderately well and well drained soils that formed in material weathered from glacial deposits.  Tallac soils are on glacial moraines and outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 1270 mm and the mean annual temperature is 5 degrees C.",
