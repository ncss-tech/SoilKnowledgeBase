Rock fragments are mainly gravel or cobbles or both, with stones and boulders in some pedons.\nSoil Reaction: slightly acid or moderately acid and can be strongly acid in the Bqm.\nThe A horizon:\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma: 1 through 3 dry or moist\nOrganic matter: 3 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw horizons:\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma: 3 through 6 dry or moist\nOrganic matter: less than 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Bqm horizon:\nHue: 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR\nCementation/compaction: There are continuous layers of dense, brittle material that restricts root and water movement.
