    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 80 to 110 consecutive days or more in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 8 to 12 percent clay.  Rock fragments average 0 to 35 percent, of which 10 to 25 percent are gravel and 0 to 10 percent are cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam and sandy loam.  It has a base saturation by ammonium acetate of 75 to 90 percent.\nThe C horizon which is present in some pedons has similar properties as the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tallowbox series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Elevations are 1,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.  Slopes range from 20 to 70 percent."
