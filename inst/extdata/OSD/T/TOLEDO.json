  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toledo soils are on lake plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Toledo soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 152 to 244 meters (500 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Fulton and moderately well drained Lucas soils that are in a toposequence with the Toledo soils. Fulton and Lucas soils occupy higher or more sloping landscape positions. The Bono, Latty, and Paulding soils are on similar landscape positions or in depressions. Bono soils have a mollic epipedon. Latty soils have a lighter colored surface layer. Paulding soils have more clay in the subsoil."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below between November and May in normal years. The ponded phase has an apparent high water table ranging from 91 cm (3 feet) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below between September and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Toledo soils are drained and used for crop production. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, legume-grass hay, small grains, and special crops such as cabbage, sugar beets, tomatoes, and onions. Undrained areas are in permanent pasture, wetland vegetation, or woodland. Native vegetation is principally elm, ash, cottonwood, soft maple, and marsh grasses."

  "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT": {
    "section": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT",
    "content": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Toledo soils occur primarily in MLRA 99 in northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan and to a lesser extent in MLRAs 97, 98, 111B, and 111C in southern Michigan and northern Indiana. The type location is in MLRA 99. The series is of large extent, over 200,000 acres."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 114 cm (Bg horizon).\nAquic conditions: the zone from 0 to 203 cm.\nA calcareous surface phase is recognized. Carbonates are present in the upper 46 cm (18 inches) of the A and Bg horizons. They are characteristically in areas that are downslope from where carbonate charge water is released from springs.\nFuture reclassification into Vertic subgroup may occur for the clay and silty clay surface phases using present taxonomy.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for the Toledo series include profiles: ER-10 (near the type location), HN-74, HN-82, PD-2, and PT-27.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
