Fulton and Lucas soils occupy higher or more sloping landscape positions. The Bono, Latty, and Paulding soils are on similar landscape positions or in depressions. Bono soils have a mollic epipedon. Latty soils have a lighter colored surface layer. Paulding soils have more clay in the subsoil."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below between November and May in normal years. The ponded phase has an apparent high water table ranging from 91 cm (3 feet) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below between September and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Toledo soils are drained and used for crop production. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, legume-grass hay, small grains, and special crops such as cabbage, sugar beets, tomatoes, and onions. Undrained areas are in permanent pasture, wetland vegetation, or woodland. Native vegetation is principally elm, ash, cottonwood, soft maple, and marsh grasses."

Carbonates are present in the upper 46 cm (18 inches) of the A and Bg horizons. They are characteristically in areas that are downslope from where carbonate charge water is released from springs.\nFuture reclassification into Vertic subgroup may occur for the clay and silty clay surface phases using present taxonomy."
