  "OVERVIEW": "The Thornlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. Thornlake soils are on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
