  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 54 degrees F. The soil is usually moist and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches. The solum ranges from 12 to 25 inches in thickness but most areas range from 12 to 20 inches. Depth to the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches with most pedons ranging from 20 to 30 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is commonly very shaly or shaly loam with 18 to 27 percent clay. Rock fragments of shale range from 35 to 75 percent. These are mostly gravel size. This horizon has moderate or strong granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 20 to 30 percent clay and 50 to 75 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has 65 to 85 percent rock fragments of shale and siltstone intermingled with soil material similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is partially consolidated and fractured to depths of 40 inches or more, but it is consolidated below 40 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Trask soils are on steep and mountainous uplands at elevations of 500 to 2,500 feet. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from shales and siltstones. They have a humid climate with cool dry summers and cool moist winters. Many summer days have fog or low cloud cover during the mornings. The annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches and more. The mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F."
