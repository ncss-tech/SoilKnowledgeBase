Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand."

All of these series except Isolde are calcareous above a depth of 40 inches.  Isolde soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F. and have a mean annual precipitation of 4 to 7 inches.  Ecklund soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hawsley soils have mean annual soil temperatures that range from 53 to 57 degrees F., Kewake soils have 15 to 25 percent pumice throughout the control section and have calcium carbonate throughout the profile."
