  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tonuco soils occur on gently undulating upland ridges, nearly level plains, alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, and valley sideslopes.  The regolith consists of coarse textured sandy eolian alluvial material derived from variety of reddish crystalline and sedimentary rocks.  This coarse textured material rests abruptly on laminated, fractured, strongly cemented to indurated caliche with the sandy material penetrating the fractures of the surface layers of the caliche.  The petrocalcic horizon may pre-date the information of the present regolith.  The slopes range from 0 to 5 percent and are often complex in character.  The climate is warm arid, continental.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with a marked summer maximum.  The average annual temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F., the average summer temperature is 80 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite P.E. Index is 13.  Frost free period is 180 to 240 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: These soils are excessively drained; runoff is negligible, and permeability is very rapid to the petrocalcic horizon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used exclusively for rangeland.  The principal vegetation is black grama, sideoats grama, bush muhly, snakeweed, and mesquite.  When overgrazed, the vegetation changes to dropseed, threeawn, sand muhly, broom snakeweed, mesquite, creosotebush, and catclaw."
