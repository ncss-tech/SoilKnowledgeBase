  "OVERVIEW": "The Toril series consists of well drained soils which are shallow and very shallow to limestone bedrock and formed primarily in residuum weathered from limestone of Cretaceous age. Toril soils are on plateau margins with slopes of 1 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual soil temperature is 53 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon typically extends throughout the solum; where it does not, its thickness is at least 18 cm (7 inches). Rock fragments in the control section range from 15 to 35 percent, and typically include channers, gravels, and flags. Subsurface horizons are strongly to violently effervescent and moderately alkaline throughout, and the surface is most often calcareous.
