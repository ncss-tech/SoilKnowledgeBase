  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Turpentine series consists of deep to very deep, well-drained soils on planar to concave stable backslopes and benches of mountains. Turpentine soils formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium from noncalcareous sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
