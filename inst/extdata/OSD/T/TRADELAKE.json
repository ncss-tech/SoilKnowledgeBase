  "OVERVIEW": "The Tradelake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium over clayey lacustrine deposits underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Permeability is moderate in the loamy deposits and slow or very slow in the clayey deposits and rapid in the sandy substratum. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
