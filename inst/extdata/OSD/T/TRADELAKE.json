    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to 60 inches. Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to clay ranges from 15 to 35 inches. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface, subsurface, and upper part of the subsoil but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. The clayey part of the subsoil is strongly acid to neutral and the lower loamy part of the subsoil is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. Content of gravel in the upper loamy mantle ranges from 0 to 10 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Volume of gravel in the clayey lacustrine deposits ranges from 0 to 1 percent and from 0 to 14 percent in the sandy substratum. Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 6 to 18 percent as a weighted average.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 3 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nTradelake soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has colors and textures like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has colors and textures like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay or silty clay. Clay content ranges from 60 to 80 percent.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is clay or silty clay. Clay content ranges from 60 to 80 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5. Texture is sand or loamy sand."
