Slopes are 1 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 5,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
