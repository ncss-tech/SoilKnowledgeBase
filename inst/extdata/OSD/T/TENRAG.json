    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the top of Bt horizon is 30 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is 49 to 80 inches. The hue is 7.5YR through l0R. Estimated soil reaction ranges from moderately acid in the E horizons to neutral in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Coarse fragments range from 30 to 40 percent in the E/B horizon and 50 to 75 percent in the Bt horizon. Mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. under full forest canopy.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bt horizon has similar value and has chroma of 4 through 6. It is heavy loam to medium clay loam with less than 35 percent clay."
