  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 63 degrees F. Under natural conditions, the soil is moist in all horizons at all times. Soil drainage has been altered on much of this soil allowing the soil to seasonally dry as deep as 20 inches; cracks develop and the soil oxidizes. The soil reaction varies with the amount of oxidation as influenced by drainage. Organic matter ranges from 15 to 30 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Thin lenses of fibrous organic matter may occur in lower horizons. The 10 to 40 inch control section is clay, silty clay or mucky clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. The electrical conductance ranges from 15 to 50 millimhos per centimeter at 25 degrees C.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, dry value of 4 through 6 and moist value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It usually has dry value of 6 in the upper part and has distinct or prominent mottles in some or all parts. This horizon is strongly to very strongly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has chroma of 1 or less and prominent yellowish or reddish mottles. It is medium to very strongly acid. It has distinct yellow efflorescence of jarosite in some pores. Lower Bg and C horizons smell strongly of H2S.\nThe C horizons are similar to Bg horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alviso, Joice, Reyes, and Una series. Alviso soils are neutral to mildly alkaline in the 10 to 20 inch section. Joice soils have 30 to 50 percent organic matter in the 10 to 40 inch section. Una soils lack the high salinity, jarosite, and other characteristics associateed with effects of salt water. Also, they have less than 15 percent organic matter."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tamba soils are in flat salt water marshes near sea level. They formed in mixed alluvium and hydrophytic plant remains. The climate is Mediterranean with a mean annual precipitation of 15 to 20 inches, hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F., average January temperature is about 46 degrees F., and average July temperature about 72 degrees F. Freeze-free season is about 260 to 280 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Joice and Reyes soils and the Suisun soils. Suisun soils have 50 percent or more organic matter."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Tamba soils were formed under very poor drainage, but under present management, these soils have altered drainage. The water table varies with the management of levees and tide gates, usually being near 3 feet in mid-summer and near the surface in winter months. Runoff is very slow or ponded and permeability is moderate."

This series was formerly classified as fine, mixed, acid, thermic Typic Halaquepts. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 5/72.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
