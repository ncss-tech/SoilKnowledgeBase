  "OVERVIEW": "The Thess series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces and basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
