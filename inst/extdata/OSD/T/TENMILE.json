  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenmile series consists of very deep, well drained soils on\ndissected alluvial terraces.  They formed in coarse mixed alluvium.\nPermeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual air\ntemperature is about 50 degrees F.",
