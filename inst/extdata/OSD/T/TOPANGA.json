  "OVERVIEW": "The Topanga series consists of shallow to fractured bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from bedded shale and sandstone. Topanga soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
