  "OVERVIEW": "The Twinlake series consists of shallow, well drained soils on backslopes and ridges of mountains.  Twinlake soils formed in colluvium from argillite and rhyolite with an influence of ash. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
