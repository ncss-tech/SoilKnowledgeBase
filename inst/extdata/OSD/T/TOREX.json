The hue is 10YR or 2.5Y throughout the soil.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.\nThe Ap, A1, and A2 horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are loamy fine sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A2 horizon is lacking in some pedons and is replaced by a C or Cca horizon.  These horizons have value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are slightly or moderately alkaline.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.\nThe underlying contrasting 2C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam, and has 20 to 35 percent clay.\nSome pedons have a very gravelly loamy sand 3C horizon below depths of 50 inches."

Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.; mean January temperature is 20 to 25 degrees F.; and mean July temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 130 days."
