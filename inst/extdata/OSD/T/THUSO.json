These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 105 days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 25 inches thick, has a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent, an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments by volume, and 8 to 18 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  The texture is gravelly ashy or very gravelly ashy sandy loam. It is 20 to 40 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  The texture is very cobbly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.

Raisio and Vanbrunt soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Borgeau soils have a particle-size control section dominated by metamorphic rock fragments and are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Eaglespring soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Garrison soils have a sandy-skeletal material in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Louiecreek soils have 8 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and the base saturation is (by sum) 75 to 100 percent except in the upper part of the A horizon.  Wagberg soils have less than 8 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Whitestone soils are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Thuso soils are on backslopes of foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  These soils formed from colluvium with minor component of glacial till from metasedimentary rock, and with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations range from 2,200 to 3,700 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 25 to 30 degrees F., the average July temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 130 days."
