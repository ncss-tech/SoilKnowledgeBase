  "OVERVIEW": "The Thuso series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in colluvium with a minor amount of glacial till from metasedimentary rock, and with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on backslopes of foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Eaglespring soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Garrison soils have a sandy-skeletal material in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Louiecreek soils have 8 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and the base saturation is (by sum) 75 to 100 percent except in the upper part of the A horizon.  Wagberg soils have less than 8 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Whitestone soils are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice."
