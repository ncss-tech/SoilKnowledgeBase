  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Gravel-size rock fragments make up 0 to 5 percent of the A horizon and upper part of the B horizon.  Gravel and cobble-size rock fragments make up 0 to 50 percent of the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Channer-size rock fragments of shale make up 0 to 60 percent of the 2B and 2C horizons, where present.  The soil ranges from moderately acid through mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8.  In the fine-earth fraction it is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon has a range for color and texture the same as that given for the Bt horizon.  Discontinuities are common in the substratum and include textures of sandy loam and sandy clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aden, Crosby, Jeddo, Library, McGary, Parsippany, Pyrmont, Randolph, and Savona.  Aden soils developed in Triassic alluvial sediments and have lower reaction throughout. Crosby, Jeddo, and Pyrmont soils developed in calcareous glacial till. Library soils are 40 to 60 inches to calcareous shale or thin bedded limestone.  McGary soils formed in lacustrine deposits and have a 24 to 40 inch solum.  Parsippany soils are in large basin areas and have lamella in the control section.  Randolph soils are 20 to 40 inches to limestone bedrock.  Savona soils formed in glacial outwash and are underlain with sand and gravel."

The soils formed in clayey alluvial deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 56 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the well drained Berks, Gilpin, and Weikert soils on the uplands and the Allegheny, Cotaco, Maurertown, and Monongahela soils on adjacent terraces.  Allegheny, Cotaco, and Monongahela soils have less clay and less gray colors throughout than Toms soils.  Maurertown soils have a dominantly gray matrix throughout.  Berks and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock and Monongahela soils have a fragipan."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils have previously been included in the Tygart series.\nThe major diagnostic horizons and features recognized in\nthis pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 21 inches (Ap and BA horizons).\nb.  Argillic horizon - The zone from 21 to 44 inches (Bt and 2Btg horizons).\nc.  Lithologic discontinuity - Change in parent material and rock fragments at 32 inches.\nCEC class based on similar soils and laboratory data.\nThe 1/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and available laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when additional laboratory data becomes available.\nCompeting series, pedon descriptions (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised (LWH-JHW-DGF 01/2006).  Previous revision date: 10/90\nRevisions made (11/2006) to update range in characteristics of C horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle size and chemical data from the site location are available from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
