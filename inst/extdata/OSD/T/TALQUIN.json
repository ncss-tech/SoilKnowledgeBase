  "OVERVIEW": "The Talquin series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soil on flats.  They formed in sandy marine sediments on the Lower Coastal Plain.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 50 inches.  The Bh horizon is less than 7 inches in thickness.  Combined thickness of the A and E horizons is less than 30 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon, after rubbing, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Unrubbed, this horizon is a mixture of white uncoated sand grains and black organic matter.  When dry, it has a salt-and-pepper appearance.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  Vertical streaks and areas of organic matter accumulation in shades of black to gray range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 3.  Sand grains are thinly to moderately coated with colloidal organic matter.  It has a weighted average of less than 0.6 percent organic carbon in the matrix of the upper 12 inches or 2.3 percent or more in the upper 2 cm.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

The somewhat poorly drained Chipley and Foxworth soils are on higher positions, and do not have spodic horizons.  The very poorly drained Rutlege soils are on lower positions, do not have spodic horizons, are sandy throughout, and have umbric epipedons.  The somewhat poorly drained Sapelo soils are on similar positions, have better developed spodic horizons and argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizon."

This revision limits these soils to (entic) Alaquods, ie. Alaquods that have a spodic horizon that has a weighted average of less than 0.6 percent organic carbon in the matrix of the upper 30 cm of the spodic horizon, and the upper subhorizon of the spodic horizon has less than 2.3 percent organic carbon in the upper 2 cm; or the subhorizon with 2.3 percent or more organic carbon is present in 90 percent or less of each pedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization sample: Sampled as S33-20-(1-10) and S37-21-(1-5), IFAS, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
