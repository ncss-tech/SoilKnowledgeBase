  "OVERVIEW": "The Tilk series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvial sediments with a high content of rock fragments.  These soils are on floodplains, alluvial fans, and low stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",
