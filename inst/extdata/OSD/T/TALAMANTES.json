  "OVERVIEW": "The Talamantes series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Talamantes soils are on alluvial fans, toe slopes, and foot slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 67 degrees F.  The moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days immediately following April 1 and is dry in all parts for 75 or more consecutive days immediately following July 1.  The soil is typically calcareous to the surface, but in some pedons is noncalcareous as deep as 10 inches.  The particle-size control section ranges from 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand.  Some pedons contain up to 10 percent gypsum crystals in masses and seams.\nThe A horizons have a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam."
