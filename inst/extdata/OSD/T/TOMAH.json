  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the bands is more than 6 inches in the B2t horizon.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  These soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches and are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches in all pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon, and typically is more than 80 percent.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 30 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon and are mainly 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter but typically are less than 3 inches in diameter.  Within the sand fraction, a high percentage is medium and coarser angular sand which has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  The solum and C horizon range from medium acid to moderately alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons, particularly where lamellae are thickest.  Texture is typically loamy coarse and or sand containing lamellae and thin bands of sandy clay loam or coarse sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  Texture is a loamy coarse sand or coarse sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tomah soils are on alluvial fans and hills or ridges where bedrock lies at considerable depth.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 30 percent.  They formed in parent materials from arkose beds.   In some locations the soft parent sediments occur above depth of 60 inches but they have so little contrast that they cannot be recognized consistently.  The average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and summer.  The frost-free season is about 115 to 125 days."
