  "OVERVIEW": "The Towaoc series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from diorite and other intrusive igneous material.  Towaoc soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 6 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
