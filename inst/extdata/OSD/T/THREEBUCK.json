    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer months.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The upper 14 to 22 inches has an estimated bulk density less than 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, phosphate  retention of 30 to 50 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and volcanic glass of 30 to 50 percent.  The lower part of the particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout except for the 3Bt3 horizon which is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam or ashy silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay, 15 to 25 percent clay, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  The texture is silty clay loam or clay with 30 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent stones, 15 to 40 percent cobbles, and 10 to 35 percent gravel.  Clay films are common or many and faint or distinct.\nThe 3Bt3 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry , and chroma of 3 to 6 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  The texture is silty clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 10 to 35 percent cobbles, and 15 to 35 percent gravel.  Clay films are many or continuous and distinct or prominent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Threebuck soils are on north and east-facing side slopes of hills, mountains, and canyons.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in ash over colluvium consisting of clay and basaltic rock fragments.  Elevation is 2,800 to 5,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
