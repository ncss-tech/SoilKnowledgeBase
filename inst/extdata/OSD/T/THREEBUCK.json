Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout except for the 3Bt3 horizon which is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.
