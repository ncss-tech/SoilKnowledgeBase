  "OVERVIEW": "The Toulon series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Toulon soils are on longshore bars, beach terraces, beach plains, and barrier beaches. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
