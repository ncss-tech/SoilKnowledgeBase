  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth in the profile.  Calcareous sand and gravel occurs below 40 inches.  Reaction throughout the profile to 10 percent HCl ranges from slightly to strongly effervescent.  Depth to water table is commonly below 40 inches but will raise to within 20 to 30 inches of the soil surface for more than 2 weeks during the growing season.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma from 2 to 4 moist.  Texture is silt loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 3 to 5 moist, and chroma from 1 to 4 moist.  Texture is dominantly silt stratified with silt loam and fine sand.  Thickness of individual strata ranges from 0.5 to 3 inches.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.\nThe C2 horizon consists of sand or loamy sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 20 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent cobble."

The climate is humid maritime with the average annual precipitation ranging from 21 to 65 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degress F.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 1000 feet."

Ashmun, Hollow, and Skagway soils occur on adjacent floodplains and have sandy or sandy skeletal control sections.  Lutak soils occur on alluvial terraces and very gravelly moraines adjacent to alluvial plains and have spodic horizons.  Funter soils consist of peat and occur in muskegs."
