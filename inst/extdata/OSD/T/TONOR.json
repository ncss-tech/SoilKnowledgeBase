    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tonor soils are on lakebeds.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash.  The source of the volcanic ash is ancestral Mt. Mazama.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,300 to 1,400 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
