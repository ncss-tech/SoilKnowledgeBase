  "OVERVIEW": "The Taylor Creek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a large component of volcanic ash and loess.  Taylor Creek soils are on uplands and have slopes of l5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
