    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Taylor Creek soils are on uplands at elevations of 1,830 to 2,290 meters.  Slopes are l5 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolite, andesite, and tuff rocks with large components of loess and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."
