These soils have formed in alluvium and loess derived from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm, and average annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 90 to 125 days."
