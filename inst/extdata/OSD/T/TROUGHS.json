  "OVERVIEW": "The Troughs series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum, alluvium and loess derived from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash. The Troughs soils are on calderas, structural benches, and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the average annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
