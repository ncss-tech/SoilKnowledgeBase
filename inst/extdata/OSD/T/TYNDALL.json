  "OVERVIEW": "The Tyndall series is a member of the coarse-loamy, superactive, mixed, calcareous, thermic family of Aeric Halaquepts. Typically, Tyndall soils have grayish brown, mildly alkaline A horizons and stratified light brownish gray, mottled, fine sandy loam, calcareous horizons developed in sedimentary alluvium.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist and have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches. Undrained pedons are saturated in winter to within 40 inches or closer to the surface.  The mean soil temperature is about 62 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Typically, the soils are calcareous throughout. Slight saline-alkali conditions may be present. The 10 to 40 inch zone averages fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay and about 20 to 25 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. There is considerable coarse stratification with individual horizon textures ranging from loamy sand to silt loam. This section is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, dry value of 4 or 5, and dry and moist chroma of 1 or 2. The darkened A horizon is too thin for a mollic epipedon. This horizon is fine sandy loam to silt loam. It has crumb to subangular blocky structure. Some pedons are massive but have a soft or slightly hard dry consistence.\nThe B horizon is marked by mottles, absence of fine stratification, and may have lime segregation's in the lower part. It includes light brownish gray, light yellowish brown, light olive gray, or pale olive dry. Moist colors are dark grayish brown (2.5Y) in most parts, and olive gray (5Y) in some parts.\nThe lower part of the C horizon is light brownish gray, pale olive, yellowish brown or brownish yellow, and contains mottles. It is similar in texture to the 10 to 40 inch control section."

Grangeville, Foster, and Pacheco soils have mollic epipedons; Pacheco soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Laugenour soils are pale colored through the A horizon with moist value of 4 or more. Maria and Sycamore soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section. Piper soils average sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the texture control section (See Remarks.)"

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Tyndall soils would formerly have been classified as Alluvial soils. The Piper and Tyndall soils are in the same family.  Additional study and differentiation is needed if one series is not to be inactivated. The classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as coarse-loamy, mixed, calcareous, thermic, Areic Haplaquepts. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 6/72.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
