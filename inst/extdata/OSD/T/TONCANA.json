  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the Al and B2t horizons is 55 to more than 60 inches over bedrock.  The upper 20 inches of the B2t horizon has 30 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation is less than 75 percent in part or all parts above a depth of 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 62  to 64 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 65 to 85 consecutive days during late summer.  The rock fragments consist of rounded quartzite pebbles and cobbles and range from 0 to 20 percent in the Al horizon and 35 to 60 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It ranges from slightly to medium acid and is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has dominant hue of 5YR through 2.5YR (7.5YR in the upper part in some pedons), value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist. It ranges from gravelly clay loam to very cobbly clay loam. Structure ranges from weak to moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky and weak medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocky.  This horizon is 35 to more than 40 inches thick."

Slopes range from 40 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium weathered from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 59 to 61 F., and the frost-free period ranges from 70 to 75 days."
