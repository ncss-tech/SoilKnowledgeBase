  "OVERVIEW": "The Toncana series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite.  These soils are on north- and east-facing mountain sides. Slopes are 40 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
