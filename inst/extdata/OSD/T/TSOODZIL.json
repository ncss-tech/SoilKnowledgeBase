  "OVERVIEW": "The Tsoodzil series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and slope alluvium over residuum derived from basalt. Tsoodzil soils are on lava plateaus and cinder cones. Slopes range from 5 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Burnel soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate. Cedarsprings, Coben, and Reget soils have hues 10YR and yellower. Friana soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the profile that is mostly cinders. Gerbana, Montillo, and Reget soils are moderately deep. Cerro, Pagoda, and Suposo soils are formed in shale parent material. Tomasaki soils are formed in diorite parent material. The Cerro, Coben, Gerbana, Pagoda, Suposo, Tomaski, and Yankee soils are in LRR-E. The Bearpaw, Gerber, Mondamin, and Regent soils are in LRR-F.  The Burnel, Danvers, Fergus, Reget, Ridgeview, and Savage soils are in LRR-G. These soils are moist in May and June."
