Burnel soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate. Cedarsprings, Coben, and Reget soils have hues 10YR and yellower. Friana soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the profile that is mostly cinders. Gerbana, Montillo, and Reget soils are moderately deep. Cerro, Pagoda, and Suposo soils are formed in shale parent material. Tomasaki soils are formed in diorite parent material. The Cerro, Coben, Gerbana, Pagoda, Suposo, Tomaski, and Yankee soils are in LRR-E. The Bearpaw, Gerber, Mondamin, and Regent soils are in LRR-F.  The Burnel, Danvers, Fergus, Reget, Ridgeview, and Savage soils are in LRR-G. These soils are moist in May and June."

Taylor and Mesa Chivato volcanic fields) and are on lava plateaus and cinder cones. Slopes are 5 to 55 percent. Elevations range from 7,600 to 9,200 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days."
