  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thompsoncabin soils are on hills and plateaus. They typically occur on backslope positions. They formed in eolian deposits derived from mixed rocks over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts. Slopes are 15 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,800 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
