Depth to the 2Bt horizon(s) ranges from about 24 to 38 inches. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, unless limed.  Subangular and angular fragments of quartz gravel and cobbles range from 35 to 75 percent in the A and BA horizons. Subangular and angular fragments of quartz gravel and cobbles range from 15 to 75 percent in the Bw horizons and 0 to 15 percent in the Bt and BC horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. The fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.
