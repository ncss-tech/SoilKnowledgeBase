  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments, mainly slate, quartz, schist and phyllite, range from 5 to 50 percent, by volume, in the A horizon and 30 to 60 percent in the B horizon, averaging 35 percent or more in the particle-size control section. If present, the C horizon rock fragment content ranges from 45 to 65 percent. Up to 15 percent of the surface can be covered with flagstones, stones and boulders. Unless limed, the soil is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is dominantly silt loam, but ranges to loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine and medium granular structure and very friable or friable consistence.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6 with hue of 7.5YR occurring in the upper part only. It is dominantly silt loam but ranges to loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, very fine, fine or medium subangular blocky structure and very friable or friable consistence.\nC horizons are present in some pedons. They have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is platy or angular blocky or the horizons are massive. Consistence is firm or friable.\nThe 2R horizon is fractured and folded phyllite, schist, quartzite or slate bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Taconic soils are gently sloping to very steep on bedrock controlled, glacially modified landforms. Slope ranges from 3 to 80 percent. The Taconic soils formed in material derived mainly from strongly folded phyllite, schist, quartzite and slate. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 56 inches, and mean annual frost-free season from 90 to 130 days. The elevation ranges from 1000 to 1800 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bernardston, Hoosic, Manlius, Macomber, Nassau, Pittstown, Quonset and Warwick soils. The Bernardston and Pittstown soils are very deep and are on adjacent till plains and hills. The Hoosic, Quonset and Warwick soils formed in outwash deposits on nearby valley terraces. Manlius and Nassau soils that are underlain by shale bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and 10 to 20 inches respectively, are at lower elevations. Macomber soils are nearby associates where bedrock is at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The use of the Taconic series in 144A is questionable because it is a frigid series. This needs to be considered in MLRA updates.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 5 inches. (A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 14 inches. (Bw horizons).\n3. Lithic subgroup - bedrock at a depth of 14 inches. (2R horizon).\n4. Dystrudepts - base saturation is less than 60 percent in the zone from 10 to 14 inches. (Bw horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data for sample no. S78VT025009. Analysed by the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nSoil Interpretation Records: NY0278, NY0322\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
