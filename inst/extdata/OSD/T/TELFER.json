It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AC horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma or 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

The soil formed in wind and water deposited sands.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 18 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer.  Frost-free period ranges from 110 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 1650 to 3600 feet."

Lihen and Seroco soils are in a landscape sequence with the Telfer soils.  Lihen soils are in concave swales and foot slopes and Seroco soils are on ridges.  Seroco soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Flasher soils are on nearby uplands.  They do not have a mollic epipedon and are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Parshall and Tally soils are on nearby terraces and uplands.  They are coarse-loamy."
