  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuloso series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Tuloso soils are on hills, benches, and ridges. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Wodomont soils receive over half of their annual precipitation amounts during the winter months, are driest during May and June, and occur in slightly warmer areas. Sombodoro soils have a clayey argillic horizon. Travessilla soils have an aridic moisture regime and do not have a cambic horizon."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18inches, two thirds of which falls in the months of June through September.Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F. The frost-freeseason ranges from 130 to 160 days and elevation ranges from 5,000 to 7,500feet."
