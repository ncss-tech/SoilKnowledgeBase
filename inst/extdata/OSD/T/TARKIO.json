  "OVERVIEW": "The Tarkio series consists of very deey, well drained soils on glacial lake terraces in intermountain valleys. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The clay type is mixed, containing mica, kaolinite, chlorite and montmorillonite and having cation exchange capacities ranging from 25 to 38 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Percent base saturation ranges above 95 and the soils are moderately to slightly acid in the solum and neutral to slightly alkaline in the C horizons.  Tarkio soils have mean annual temperature ranging from 42 to 46 degrees F. and average summer soil temperatures ranging from 59 to 62 degrees F. in cultivated fields.  The soils are usually moist but the B and C horizons are dry in late summer and early fall from about July 20 to October 1.  Hue ranges from 5YR through 10R.  The E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  The B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay with from 60 to 80 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sands.  There are few to many varves of light gray silt to silty clay 1/4 inch to 2 inches thick occurring throughout the lower part of the profile starting in lower B horizons."
