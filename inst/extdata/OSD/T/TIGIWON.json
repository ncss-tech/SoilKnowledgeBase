    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 6 to 12 inches, but is not shallower than the upper 3 inches of the B2t horizon.  Typically the solum extends to the IIC horizon but thin C horizons may occur above the IIC horizon in some pedons.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 7 to 12 inches.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the IIC horizon and are dominantly less than 3 inches in diameter.  Reaction above the B3ca horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically gravelly sandy clay loam but clay averages 18 to 35 percent in the fine earth fraction.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline and has about 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth."

Bosler soils have solums thicker than 12 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and have sandyskeletal IIC horizons below depth of 20 inches; Millburne soils have weakly cemented calcic horizons and have sandy-skeletal IIC horizons below depth of 20 inches.  Platoro soils have solums more than 12 inches thick to the base of the argillic horizon, have sandy-skeletal IIC horizons below depth of 20 inches and are calcareous above the upper 3 inches of the B2t horizon.  Relsob soils lack continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate."

The soils formed in mixed alluvial parent materials derived from a variety of rock sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is approximately 11 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 58 degrees F."
