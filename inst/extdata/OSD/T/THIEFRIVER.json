The upper mantle averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and the 2C horizon contains 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.  A gravelly layer up to 10 inches thick is at the boundary between the Cg and 2Cg horizons in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.   Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  It is friable or very friable.  Some pedons have an Ak horizon.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is friable or very friable.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Thiefriver soils are level and nearly level and formed in 20 to 40 inches of coarse loamy and sandy or sandy lacustrine sediments over clayey till or lacustrine sediments on lake plains.  These materials are of late Wisconsin age.  Slopes are plane or concave with a gradient of 0 to 2 percent.  Typically, these soils are on broad flats, but some are on long, narrow, and irregularly shaped areas that are 1 to 4 feet lower than adjacent better drained soils.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 1200 feet."

Clearwater, Espelie, Rosewood and Wyandotte soils are on similar positions as Thiefriver soils.  Clearwater soils are clayey throughout.  Espelie soils lack a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface.  Rosewood soils are sandy throughout.  Hilaire and Huot soils are on higher lying positions and are better drained."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid or rapid in the upper part and slow in the clayey underlying horizons.  Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is at 0.5 to 1.5 feet at some time during the period of March through June in most years."
