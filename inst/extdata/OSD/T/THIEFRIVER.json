  "OVERVIEW": "The Thiefriver series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed dominantly in a mantle of sandy lacustrine sediments over clayey till or lacustrine sediments primarily on lake plains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid or rapid in the upper mantle, and slow in the clayey underlying sediments.  These soils have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 21 inches.",

These materials are of late Wisconsin age.  Slopes are plane or concave with a gradient of 0 to 2 percent.  Typically, these soils are on broad flats, but some are on long, narrow, and irregularly shaped areas that are 1 to 4 feet lower than adjacent better drained soils.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 1200 feet."

Espelie soils lack a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface.  Rosewood soils are sandy throughout.  Hilaire and Huot soils are on higher lying positions and are better drained."
