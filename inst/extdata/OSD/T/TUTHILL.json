  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Free carbonate is at depths of 30 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to the contrasting 2C horizon ranges from about 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 9 to 12 inches, but ranges from 7 to 20 inches and extends into the Bt horizon of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a loamy fine sand overblown phase.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, and clay loam averaging between 35 and 70 percent sand and ranging from 18 to 35 percent clay.  It is loam in some pedons.  The Bt horizon is very hard or extremely hard and slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  Thin to moderately thick strata of loam or sandy loam are between depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons.  Loamy sands and fine sands are weakly cemented between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Altvan soils contain less sand and more silt in the argillic horizons and have more than 15 percent gravel in the 2C horizon.  Atencio and Redridge soils have a hue of 7.5YR or redder in the Bt horizon.  Eckley, Gustspring, Newlin, and Wheatridge soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the 2C horizon.  In addition, Eckley soils have sand and gravel at a depth above 20 inches and Newlin soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the solum.  Landavaso soils contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the 2C horizon.  Wolfvar soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

Alice and Anselmo soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes.  Canyon soils contain more silt and are shallow to sandstone.  They are on ridges and side slopes.  Jayem soils are coarse-loamy and do not have an argillic horizon.  They are in swales and lower foot slopes.  Holt, Keith, and Rosebud soils are on similar landscapes.  Holt soils are coarse-loamy.  Keith soils are fine-silty.  Rosebud soils are underlain by limy sandstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tassel soils are shallow to sandstone and are on ridges and side slopes.  Valentine soils are sandy and typically are on hummocky landscapes.  Vetal and Woodly soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches and are on flats and in shallow depressions."
