  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuthill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy materials on uplands.  These soils have moderate permeability in the subsoil and rapid permeability in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 9 to 12 inches, but ranges from 7 to 20 inches and extends into the Bt horizon of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a loamy fine sand overblown phase.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, and clay loam averaging between 35 and 70 percent sand and ranging from 18 to 35 percent clay.  It is loam in some pedons.  The Bt horizon is very hard or extremely hard and slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  Thin to moderately thick strata of loam or sandy loam are between depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons.  Loamy sands and fine sands are weakly cemented between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Jayem soils are coarse-loamy and do not have an argillic horizon.  They are in swales and lower foot slopes.  Holt, Keith, and Rosebud soils are on similar landscapes.  Holt soils are coarse-loamy.  Keith soils are fine-silty.  Rosebud soils are underlain by limy sandstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tassel soils are shallow to sandstone and are on ridges and side slopes.  Valentine soils are sandy and typically are on hummocky landscapes.  Vetal and Woodly soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches and are on flats and in shallow depressions."
