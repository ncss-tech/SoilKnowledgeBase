  "OVERVIEW": "The Tygh series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium weathered mostly from sedimentary bedrock and mixed with loess and ash.  These soils are on bottom lands.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Depth to very gravelly sand is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons have loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the lower 10 inches of the control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has common to many, fine to large distinct or prominent mottles in 5YR or 7.5YR hue.  Thin lenses, ranging from silt to very gravelly sand are in the C horizons in some pedons.  The 2C horizon is sand or loamy sand with 50 to 85 percent gravel."

Bunejug soils have an accumulation of salts in the A horizons, have mottles in the lower part of the mollic epipedon, and have finely stratified sandy loam, fine and very fine sandy loam, loamy fine and very fine sand, silt loam, and light silty clay loam.  Rose Creek soils are mildly to strongly alkaline and are usually slightly calcareous."
