Depth to very gravelly sand is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons have loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the lower 10 inches of the control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has common to many, fine to large distinct or prominent mottles in 5YR or 7.5YR hue.  Thin lenses, ranging from silt to very gravelly sand are in the C horizons in some pedons.  The 2C horizon is sand or loamy sand with 50 to 85 percent gravel."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bunejug and Rose Creek series.  Bunejug soils have an accumulation of salts in the A horizons, have mottles in the lower part of the mollic epipedon, and have finely stratified sandy loam, fine and very fine sandy loam, loamy fine and very fine sand, silt loam, and light silty clay loam.  Rose Creek soils are mildly to strongly alkaline and are usually slightly calcareous."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered mostly from sedimentary bedrock and mixed with loess and ash.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F, the mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
