In most years the soils are usually moist but dry between 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the 3-month period following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to secondary lime ranges from 20 to 40 inches with the calcic horizon having a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 20 percent.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate and less than 0.1 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  It is ashy silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe C horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe 2Bkb1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It is moderately to strongly calcareous with segregated or mycelium lime in the lower part.\nThe 2Bk2 horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.   It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and  0 to 5 percent cobbles."
