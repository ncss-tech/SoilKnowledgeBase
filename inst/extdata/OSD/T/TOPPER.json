  "OVERVIEW": "The Topper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Topper soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

In most years the soils are usually moist but dry between 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the 3-month period following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to secondary lime ranges from 20 to 40 inches with the calcic horizon having a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 20 percent.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate and less than 0.1 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  It is ashy silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe C horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.
