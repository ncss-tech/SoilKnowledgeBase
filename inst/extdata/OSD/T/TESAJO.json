  "OVERVIEW": "The Tesajo series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Tesajo soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, flood plains, and valley floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
