  "OVERVIEW": "The Trocken series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Trocken soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, inset fans, fan skirts, longshore bars, barrier beaches, beach terraces, and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
