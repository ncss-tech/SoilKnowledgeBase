  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (Oi, A, and AB horizon)2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 30 to 202 centimeters (BAt, Bt1, Bt2, & Bt3 horizons)\n3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of 20 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon\n4. Humult feature - 22.7 kilograms per square meter of organic carbon to a depth of 1 meter\n5. Palehumult features - Clay remains at least 92 percent of its maximum to a depth of 200 centimeters\n6. Parasesquic mineralogy - There is 24 percent dithionite-extractable sesquioxides in the clay fraction of the particle-size control section\n7. CEC to clay ratio is 16 to 24 meq/100g in the major part of the argillic horizon\n8. Particle-size control section - the zone from 30 to 80 centimeters, averages 41 percent clay and 21 percent fine sand or coarser, by weight, and 4 percent rock fragments, by volume. (BAt, Bt1 horizons)\nOther features - There is 91 percent resistant minerals in the very fine sand fraction. The very fine sand and silt fractions are mostly quartz, although coarser sand and gravel fractions are predominantly schist fragments. Vermiculite, kaolinite, and chlorite are identifiable clay minerals by x-ray analysis. Although vermiculite is a major clay mineral, the CEC is kept low by the combined influence of ferric iron, gibbsite, and kaolinite."
