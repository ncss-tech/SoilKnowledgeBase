  "OVERVIEW": "The Tossup series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. These soils are on upper mountain slopes and broad ridges and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1524 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
