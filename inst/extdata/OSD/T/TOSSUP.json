These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and mudstone.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2030 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F)and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F). The mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The frost free period is about 150 to 250 days."
