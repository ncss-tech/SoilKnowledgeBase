  "OVERVIEW": "The Tachi series consists of deep, poorly drained, saline-sodic soils formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Tachi soils are on flood plains and in basins and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 to 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is saturated in some or all parts at some time of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 70 degrees F.  It is typically saline-sodic in some part of the profile.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is 0.5 to 8.0 mmhos.  When the soil is dry, vertical cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are 1 to 6 inches wide.   Intersecting slickensides occur below a depth of 5 inches.  Clay content ranges from 60 to 75 percent above 1 meter, but it is 40 to 75 percent below 1 meter.\nThe Ap horizon is not present in all areas.  The A horizon has dry color of 5Y 4/1, 3/1, 5/2 and moist color of 5Y 2/1, 2/2, 3/1; or N 2/0.  Above 1 meter, if chromas are 1.5 or higher, there are distinct or prominent mottles.  There are mottles in the lower part of the A horizon.  Moist mottles are distinct or prominent and have color of 5YR 4/6, 4/4; 2.5YR 4/6; 5Y 5/3; or 2.5Y 5/4.  In some areas mottles are not present in this horizon.  The A horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 7/1, 6/1, 6/2, 5/1, 5/2, 4/1; or 10YR 7/2 and moist color of 5Y 6/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/1, 4/2, 3/1, 3/2, 2/1; 2.5Y 4/2; 10YR 4/2; or N 2/0.  Moist mottles are distinct to prominent and have color of 7.5YR 5/8, 5/6, 4/4; 5YR 4/6, 4/4, 3/3; 10YR 5/6, 4/6, 4/4; 5Y 6/3, 6/1, 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 2/1; 2.5Y 6/6, 5/6; or N 2/0.   Above 1 meter, if chromas are 1.5 or higher, there are distinct or prominent mottles.  It is clay or silty clay.  Sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 0 to 70 percent.  Gypsum crystals may be present in the C horizon."
