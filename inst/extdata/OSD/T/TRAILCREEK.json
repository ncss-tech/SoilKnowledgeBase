  "OVERVIEW": "The Trailcreek series consists of moderately deep to a paralithic contact, well drained soils on mountainsides, foothills, and terraces.  They formed in alluvium and residuum from consolidated volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes range from 12 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

All of these soils, except Lonigan, lack a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Lonigan soils are ashy-skeletal.  Coalbank soils are in slightly concave positions or on north and east-facing slopes.  Lonigan soils are on convex positions and are generally on south and west-facing slopes.  Cedarhill soils are associated with limestone on mountain slopes.  Bancroft, Ririe, and Watercanyon soils formed in loess and are on fan terraces and hillslopes.  Hondoho soils are skeletal and formed in alluvium from quartzite and are on terrace breaks.  Hades soils formed in silty alluvium and are generally in concave positions on similar landscapes."
