    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trailcreek soils are on mountainsides, foothills, and terraces.  Slopes range from 12 to 50 percent.  They formed in alluvium and residuum from consolidated volcanic ash.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 to 18 inches.  Average annual temperature is about 41 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,000 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bancroft, Cedarhill (T), Coalbank (T), Hades, Hondoho, Lonigan (T), Ririe, and Watercanyon (T) soils.  All of these soils, except Lonigan, lack a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Lonigan soils are ashy-skeletal.  Coalbank soils are in slightly concave positions or on north and east-facing slopes.  Lonigan soils are on convex positions and are generally on south and west-facing slopes.  Cedarhill soils are associated with limestone on mountain slopes.  Bancroft, Ririe, and Watercanyon soils formed in loess and are on fan terraces and hillslopes.  Hondoho soils are skeletal and formed in alluvium from quartzite and are on terrace breaks.  Hades soils formed in silty alluvium and are generally in concave positions on similar landscapes."
