  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Trappe soils were formerly included with areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support submersed aquatic vegetation. These soils would classify in the proposed Subaquic subgroup. The initial name proposed for this series was Newport. It was revised to Queponca and later changed to Trappe.\nRefer to Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland; G.P. Demas, J.H. Brown, and M.C. Rabenhorst; July 1998.  Possible groundwater intrusion occurs at a depth of 15 to 60 inches.  (38 to 152 centimeters)\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (oxidized)--the zone from 0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 centimeters) (A horizon)\nPeraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 60 inches (0 to 150 centimeters) is permanently saturated\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData Map Unit ID: To be developed\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
