  "OVERVIEW": "The Tolex series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from igneous argillite, sandstone, and metasedimentary rock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
