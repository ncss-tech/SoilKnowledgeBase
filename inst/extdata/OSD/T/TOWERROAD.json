  "OVERVIEW": "The Towerroad series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, saline-sodic soils formed in mixed alluvium and lacustrine deposits on basin floors and playa rims.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches(100 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.(18 degrees C.).",
