  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solumn thickness and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 30 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly to extremely acid unless limed. Coarse fragments from 2 mm to 4 inches in diameter range from 10 to 35 percent in the A and Bt horizons. Fragments in the Btx and Cx horizons range from 25 to 75 percent. Fragments are mostly gravel size fragments of chert with some cobbles, but in some pedons up to 25 percent are sandstone or siltstone angular fragments and channers.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is gravelly silt loam or silt loam.\nThe BE and Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is gravelly silt loam or rarely gravelly silty clay loam. Some pedons have less than 15 percent fragments in the upper part of these horizons.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redoximorphic features are in shades of gray and brown. Many pedons are a combination of these colors without a dominant color for the matrix. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cx or C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redoximorphic features are in shades of red, brown, and gray. Many pedons are a combination of these colors without a dominant color for the matrix. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam."
