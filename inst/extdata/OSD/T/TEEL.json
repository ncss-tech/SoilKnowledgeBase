  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 50 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the solum and 0 to 20 percent by volume in the C horizon. The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral above a depth of 30 inches and moderately acid to slightly alkaline below.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam. They have weak or moderate granular structure, or weak subangular blocky structure, and very friable or friable consistence. Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 2 to 5 inches.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. The B horizon contains redoximorphic features, including redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less in some part between depths of 12 to 24 inches below the soil surface. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate, subangular blocky or prismatic structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has colors and textures similar to the B horizon. It has weak or moderate, subangular blocky or prismatic structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 0 to 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. The C horizon is massive or has plate like divisions from fine stratification. Some pedons have layers of sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or silty clay loam below a depth of 40 inches. Consistence is loose to firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Chagrin, Eel, Genesee, Hadley, Hamlin, Middlebury, Moshannon, Tioga, Wilbur and Winooski series are similar soils in closely related families. Chagrin, Eel, and Genesee soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Hadley and Winooski soils have less than 60 percent base saturation. Hamlin soils lack iron depletions within a depth of 24 inches. Middlebury and Tioga soils have coarse- loamy particle-size control sections. Moshannon soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections. Wilbur soils have a superactive CEC class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Teel soils are nearly level soils on floodplains along streams and low gradient alluvial fans. The water table extends up into the lower part of the subsoil in the winter and spring. These soils formed in alluvium predominantly from areas of glacial drift that contains limestone, fine grained sandstone and granite. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 42 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F; and mean frost-free season is 120 to 180 days."

Palmyra and Howard soils are on nearby terraces and the Honeoye, Lansing and Ontario soils and their wetter associates are on nearby till-covered uplands."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Teel series was previously mapped across two drainage classes, moderately well and somewhat poor. It is now restricted to moderately well drained and the proposed Wakeville series covers the somewhat poorly drained class where the water table is at depths less than 18 inches below the soil surface.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 38 inches (Bw and BCg horizons).\n3. Fluvaquentic subgroup - an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth greater than 0.2 percent carbon within a depth of 4 feet, and redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the soil surface (Bw2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from Cornell University Soil Survey Laboratory - pedon number S72NY27-5.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
