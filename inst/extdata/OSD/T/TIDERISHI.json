  "OVERVIEW": "The Tiderishi series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick overlying till. They are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
