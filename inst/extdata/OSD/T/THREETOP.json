Rock fragments are mainly angular sandstone pebbles.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly acid through  mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  It is neutral through  moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent and commonly increase with depth.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 30 percent, most of which is authigenic.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe R is hard, argillaceous sandstone.  It commonly is more than 5 feet thick."

Balon, Barx, Buckle, Cambria, Cerrillos, Clovis, Decolney, Fernando, Forkwood, Fort Collins, Harbord, Hiland, Los Alamos, Maysdorf, Millet, Oelop, Olney, Penistaja, Potts, Rauzi, Scholle, Spenlo, Stoneham, Sundance, Tapia, Toluca, Tuweep, and Yenlo soils are deep.  Bowbac, Cushman, Gaddes and Pokeman soils have a paralithic contact.  Fattig soils have dark lithachromic colors inherited from carbonaceous parent material.  Flaco soils have less than 35 percent sand in the argillic horizon.  Gapbutte soils have hues redder than 7.5YR.  Hagerman soils do not have a calcic horizon and have warmer mean annual soil temperatures.  Palacid and Progresso soils are usually dry in the moisture control section during the months of April, May and June.  Pugsley and Spangler soils are noncalcareous throughout."
