Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 23 cm (A1 and A2)\n1.1  Colors have too high of value and are not thick enough for mollic epipedon\n1.2 Organic carbon less than 0.6 percent (Lincoln lab data)\n2.  Argillic horizon -- 23 to 69 cm (Bt1 and Bt2)\n2.1 Clay increased from 8 percent clay (A2) to 23 percent (Bt1 and Bt2) by field estimates and hydrometer.\n2.2 Clay films observed\nOther Soil Characteristics:\n1.  Thermic soil temperature regime -- (MAST 15 to 17.8 degrees C) on preliminary SCS soil temperature transect 55 years local climatic records and BLM data.\n2.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed; no indications otherwise\n3.  Particle-size class -- loamy-skeletal estimates, hydrometer, and rock fragment content.\n4.  Xeric subgroup -- soil moisture control section is dry less than three fourths time that the soil temperature at 51 cm is above 5 degrees C (based on SCS moisture/temperature transect data.\n5.  Moisture regime -- Aridic-Xeric\n5.1  The MCS is dry throughout from May 15 to December 1.  It is moist throughout from January 1 to April 1.\n5.2  The soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C from February 15 to December 15 (300 days).  Within this time period, the MCS is dry from May 15 to December 1 (200 days).\n5.3  The soil temperature exceeds 8.3 degrees C from March 1 to November 15 (260 days).
