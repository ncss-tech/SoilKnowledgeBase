  "OVERVIEW": "The Travona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash influenced alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans and hills.  Slopes are 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
