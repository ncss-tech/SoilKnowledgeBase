The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the 2Bt horizon.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 25 to 40 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tenwalter soils are on outwash plains as patterned ground also referred to as biscuit-scabland.  Tenwalter is the scabland.   The soil formed in glacial outwash with an influence of loess in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 2600 to 3000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Kahneeta soils are on depressional scabland areas of outwash plains, are somewhat poorly drained and moderately deep to a duripan.  Milldam soils are on outwash plains, are fine-loamy and moderately deep to a duripan.  Olallie soils are on adjacent flood plains, are loamy-skeletal, and very deep.  Skooker and Tolius soils are on adjacent forested outwash plains.  Skooker soils are loamy-skeletal and have an ash influence. Tolius soils are fine-loamy and have an ash influence."
