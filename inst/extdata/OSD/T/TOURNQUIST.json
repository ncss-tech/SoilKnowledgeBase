  "OVERVIEW": "The Tournquist series is a member of a fine-loamy, mixed, frigid family of pachic Ultic Haploxerolls. The soils have reddish brown strong granular loam A horizons, reddish brown, loamy B2 horizons and hard bedrock at 45 inches. The soils are slightly acid and contain about 20 to 40 percent gravel below the A horizons. The classification is tentative.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 22 to 60 inches to the bottom of the B2 horizon and the depth to rock is 22 to over 60 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 55 degrees. Amount of coarse fragments increases with depth. The soil surface usually is covered with 1 to 2 percent stones. The A horizon colors are in 7.5YR and 5YR hues and have values of 3 and 4 dry and 3 moist Chromas are 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Texture ranges from loam to gravelly loam; structure is granular and reaction is slightly acid or neutral. The B horizon colors are in 5YR and 2.YR hues with values of 4 dry and 3 moist Chroma is 4 dry and 3 or 4 moist Texture ranges from gravelly loam to gravelly light clay loam, structure from nearly massive to subangular blocky or granular; and reaction from slightly acid to neutral. There are common cobbles and stones. The C horizons are yellowish red to dark reddish brown very gravelly, very cobbly, and bouldery loams or clay loams."

The Cohasset soils have A horizons with moist chromas of 4 and strongly acid clay loam Bt horizons. The Gleason soils have grayish brown A horizons and grayish brown medium acid B horizons The Newland soils have dark grayish brown A horizons and brown heavy clay loam Bt horizons. The Woodcock soils have more than 50 percent coarse fragments in the B2t horizons."

It is unknown where in Oregon this survey might be used, if at all. There are no component records for the Tournquist series in NASIS as of 7/14/2005. It is likely that this series will be dropped in the near future.\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 6/67.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
