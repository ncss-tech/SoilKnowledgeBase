  "OVERVIEW": "The Tetonview series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, glacial outwash plains, flood plains and closed depressions.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
