  "OVERVIEW": "The Trude series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly outwash. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid below. They are on terraces and outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
