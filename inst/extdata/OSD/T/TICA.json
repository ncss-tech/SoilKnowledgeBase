  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tica soils are on hills and mountains.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 9,400 feet, but range as low as 6,800 feet on north-facing exposures.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyodacitic tuff.  Small to very large rock outcrops of tuff occur with these soils.  The climate is semiarid to subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 22 inches, most of which comes in the form of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 75 days."

Nevtah soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have thick mollic epipedons, and do not have argillic horizons.  Udel soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow to lithic contacts, and do not have argillic horizons.  Wilpar soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have a frigid temperature regime.  Winu soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have thick mollic epipedons."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of March 2001 updates the taxonomic class from Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Argic Lithic Cryoborolls.  Further study is needed in the future to determine if the mesic and frigid temperature regimes are more appropriate for part of the range of this series in the Meadow Valley Area, Nevada.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons and part of the Bt1 horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 18 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 18 inches to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 18 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
