  "OVERVIEW": "The Telecan series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from interbedded sandstone and limestone.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans, fan aprons, and valley fills.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",
