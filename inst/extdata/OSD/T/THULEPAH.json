  "OVERVIEW": "The Thulepah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  These soils are on hilltops, mountain side slopes and plateaus. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
