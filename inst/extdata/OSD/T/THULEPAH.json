  "OVERVIEW": "The Thulepah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  These soils are on hilltops, mountain side slopes and plateaus. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

These soils may be at elevations below 1,525 on steeper north facing mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  These soils have formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed but predominantly basaltic rock.  They are in a cold, continental climate having mean annual precipitation of 300 to 400 mm.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 30 to 55 days."
