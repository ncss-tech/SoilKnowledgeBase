These soils may be at elevations below 1,525 on steeper north facing mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  These soils have formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed but predominantly basaltic rock.  They are in a cold, continental climate having mean annual precipitation of 300 to 400 mm.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 30 to 55 days."
