  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F. The 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from heavy silty clay loam to clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay and less than 15 percent rock fragments.  There is a continuous zone of free carbonates in all parts of the fine earth fraction between depths of 10 and 20 inches.  The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3.  When plowed, the Ap horizon is commonly moderately or strongly calcareous.  The lower part of the control section is stratified in some pedons.  Mottles or other evidence of wetness are below 40 inches in some pedons."

Dollard and Sunburst soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section less than 3/4 of the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more.  Monteview soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Ragtown soils have mean annual temperature warmer than 47 degrees F."

The soils formed in clayey and silty lacustrine deposits.  The semiarid climate has  an average frost free season of 90 to 105 days and a mean annual precipitation of 7 to 9 inches. including 1.5 to 3 feet of snowfall.  Maximum precipitation falls in May and June."
