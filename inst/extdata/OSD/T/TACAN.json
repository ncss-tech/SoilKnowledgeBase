  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges from 21 to 39 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Stones cover 10 to 25 percent of the surface. Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 57 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months and are dry for 70 to 85 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice. The soils range from mildly to moderately alkaline and are calcareous at depths of 40 inches or deeper. The Al horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from very stony sandy loam to very stony very fine sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam and contains 40 to 70 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 through 6. It ranges from gravelly fine sandy clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam to very cobbly light clay loam and contains 35 to 70 percent rock fragments."

Lonti and Poley soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, and have horizons of carbonate accumulation. Nehar soils have stony sandy clay argillic horizons. Tobish soils have gravelly light clay or gravelly sandy clay argillic horizons and have less than 35 percent rock fragments. Washoe soils have xeric moisture regime. Larim soils have loose sand and gravel at depths of 11 to 18 inches. Sedillo and Willhand soils have horizons of carbonate accumulation at depths of about 15 to 20 inches. Willhand soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower. Romberg soils have horizons of carbonate accumulation at depths of about 29 inches."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from sandstone, siltstone, shale and conglomerate. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F., average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the frost-free season is 120 to 160 days."
