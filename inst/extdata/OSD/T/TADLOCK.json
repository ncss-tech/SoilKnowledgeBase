    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 72 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.  Many pedons\nbecome more acid with depth.  Few small quartz pebbles occur throughout some pedons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma 4 or\n6.  Below 40 inches some pedons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of\n4, and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is clay or clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic has more than 30 percent sand and less than\n30 percent silt.  The clay content gradually decreases with depth.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or yellow in the lower B2t horizon.  Many pedons have some dark coatings of manganese and\na few iron or manganese concretions in the B2t horizon."

Cumberland soils have more silt and less sand in the upper 20\ninches of the argillic horizon.  Coronaco and Nacogdoches soils\nhave kaolinitic mineralogy.  Fayetteville soils have less than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Tadlock soils were formerly classified in the\nReddish-Brown Lateritic great soil group.  In the past these soils have been included with Greenville and Akron (inactive series)\nsoils.  Laboratory data is available on the typical pedon (S70Ala24-7-(1-4)) run by Dr. B. F. Hajek of Auburn University.  Also, data is available on two pedons (S61Ala-53-1-(1-6) and S61Ala-53-2-(1-7)) in Perry County, Alabama, run by Lincoln Soil Survey Laboratory.
