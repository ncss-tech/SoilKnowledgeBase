  "OVERVIEW": "The Thirtycent series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediment. Thirtycent soils are on sideslopes and noseslopes of glacially modified hills. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
