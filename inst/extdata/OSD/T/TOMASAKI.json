  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tomasaki series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from diorite.  These soils are on glacial outwash fans at elevations of 7,800 to 9,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

These soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section more than half the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is higher than 41 degrees F.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry and moist.  Textures are clay or clay loam in the Bt and cobbly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam or very cobbly clay in the 2Bt.  The upper 20 inches of this horizon averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."
