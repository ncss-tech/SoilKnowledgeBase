  "OVERVIEW": "The Throck series consists of soils that are moderately deep and deep over claystone bedrock or dense clay. They are calcareous, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or residuum derived from claystone and siltstone. They occur on gently sloping to steep footslopes and back slopes of ridges. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
