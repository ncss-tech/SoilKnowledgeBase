  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments, mostly channers, range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the soil. Unless limed, reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the mineral soil.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR with value of 2.5 or 3 and chroma of 1, 2, or 3. The organic material is dominantly partially decomposed hemic material mostly from woody vegetation. Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium granular.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 3. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine through coarse, granular or subangular blocky and consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E or Eg horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak, medium through coarse, subangular blocky or thin through thick platy. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 or 3 and has redoximorphic features. Horizons with chroma of 3 have chroma of 1 or 2 on ped faces. It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak and moderate, fine through coarse subangular blocky, prismatic, or thin through thick platy. Consistence is friable or firm.\nSome pedons have thin C horizons with colors and textures similar to the B horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nRuse, Tor and Tuller are similar soils in related families. Ruse soils are higher in reaction and are over limestone. Tor soils are loamy-skeletal. Tuller soils have a mesic soil temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Torull soils are nearly level and gently sloping landscapes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in acid till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. They are on bedrock controlled upland flats or benches and steps on mountain sides. Annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 49 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the growing season is 100 to 120 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Halcott, Hawksnest, Elka, Gretor, Lewbeach, Mongaup, Onteora, Rockrift, Suny, Vly and Willowemoc soils. Halcott and Hawksnest soils are better drained and on drier parts of the same landscapes. Elka, Lewbeach, Rockrift, and Willowemoc are very deep soils. Mongaup and Vly soils are better drained and moderately deep. Gretor soils are also moderately deep and are somewhat poorly drained. Onteora and Suny soils are on the same general landscape positions but are very deep to bedrock."
