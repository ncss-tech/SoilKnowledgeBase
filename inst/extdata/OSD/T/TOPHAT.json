  "OVERVIEW": "The Tophat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from mixed sources. These soils are on hills, mountains, ridges and landslides. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

They have a forest litter horizon and lack a mollic epipedon. Nearl soils are on nearby basins. They have a forest litter horizon, lack an argillic horizon, and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick. Quirt soils are on nearby sideslopes. They formed in residuum from shale, have a mollic epipedon less that 16 inches thick, and are 15 to 30 inches deep to carbonates. Sedgway soils are on nearby ridges, summits and sideslopes. They average less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick."
