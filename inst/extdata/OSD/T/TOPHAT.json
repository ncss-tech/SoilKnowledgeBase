They have a forest litter horizon and lack a mollic epipedon. Nearl soils are on nearby basins. They have a forest litter horizon, lack an argillic horizon, and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick. Quirt soils are on nearby sideslopes. They formed in residuum from shale, have a mollic epipedon less that 16 inches thick, and are 15 to 30 inches deep to carbonates. Sedgway soils are on nearby ridges, summits and sideslopes. They average less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick."
