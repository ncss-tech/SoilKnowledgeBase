  "OVERVIEW": "The Towosahgy series consists of very deep, well drained soils on ridgetops of old natural levees. These soils formed in loamy alluvium over sandy sediments in the Mississippi River flood plains. Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

The average clay content is 18 to 30 percent.\nThe 2AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have iron depletions with chroma of 2 below depths of 40 inches. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand but ranges to include fine sandy loam and sandy loam below depths of 40 inches. In some pedons it is stratified below depths of 40 inches."

Cooter soils are clayey over sandy and occur in old stream channels. Malden soils are sandy throughout the control section and occur on slightly higher terrace positions. Reelfoot and Tiptonville soils are fine-silty and occur on lower natural levees. Tunica soils are clayey over loamy, lack a mollic epipedon and occur in depressional areas."
