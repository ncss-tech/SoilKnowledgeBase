Reaction is medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is dominantly fine sandy loam, loam and clay loam, but the ranges to silt loam and silty clay loam. The average clay content is 18 to 30 percent.\nThe 2AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have iron depletions with chroma of 2 below depths of 40 inches. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand but ranges to include fine sandy loam and sandy loam below depths of 40 inches. In some pedons it is stratified below depths of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowdre, Cooter, Malden, Reelfoot, Tiptonville and Tunica soils. Bowdre soils are clayey over loamy and are on similar landscapes. Cooter soils are clayey over sandy and occur in old stream channels. Malden soils are sandy throughout the control section and occur on slightly higher terrace positions. Reelfoot and Tiptonville soils are fine-silty and occur on lower natural levees. Tunica soils are clayey over loamy, lack a mollic epipedon and occur in depressional areas."
