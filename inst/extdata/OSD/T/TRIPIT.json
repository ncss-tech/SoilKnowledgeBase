  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick, depth to calcareous material ranges from 6 to 20 inches, the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches thick and depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon ranges from 1 to about 3 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. Typically the solum extends to the bedrock but in some pedons a C horizon is present. Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in a major part of the particle size control section and are mostly small limestone fragments. They tend to increase in volume near the paralithic contact. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It usually has crumb or granular structure, but has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is usually light clay loam but has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt and 20 to 50 percent sand, with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon usually has prismatic structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. It has oriented clay films in some part. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR through 10R. It has 1 to 4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. This horizon is calcareous but it does not have continuous accumulation of visible secondary calcium carbonate. It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Accola, Amsden, Barbarela, Coldspring, Croftshaw, Dewville, Gelkie, Leavitt,  Michelson, Monaberg, Morset, Newlands, Oro Fino, Philipsburg, Wellsville, and Youga soils lack bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Inchau and Zade soils are noncalcareous throughout. Lymanson soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout, and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation. Kezar, Lucky, Miracle, Mult, Passcreek, and Woosley soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tripit soils are on gently or moderately sloping upland hills and ridges in areas where reddish bedrock lies near the surface. Slopes usually range from 2 to about 30 percent. The soils formed in moderately thick, reddish, calcareous sediments weathered residually from redbed shales and interbedded limestone. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 19 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer. The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F., the average summer temperature is 56 degrees F."
