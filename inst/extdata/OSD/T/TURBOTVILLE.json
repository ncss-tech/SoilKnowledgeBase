  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to top of the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches and to the base from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 5 feet or more.  Coarse fragments range from 1 to 20 percent in the solum and up to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid in the upper solum to slightly alkaline in the C horizon.  In plowed pedons, an Ap horizon replaces the A and all or part of the BE, AB, BA or E.  It ranges from 6 to 10 inches thick.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry color values are 5 or more.  Texture is loam, silt loam or gravelly analogues.\nThe BE horizon, or AB, BA or E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is loam, silt loam or gravelly analogues.\nThe Bt and Btx horizons have matrix hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Iron concentrations have hues of 10YR, 7.5YR and 5YR, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 5 through 8.  Iron depletions have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or gravelly analogues.  The structure is generally subangular blocky in the Bt horizon. The Btx horizon also includes weak coarse prismatic or platy structure.  Consistence is generally friable or slightly firm in the Bt horizon and firm or extremely firm in the Btx horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly analogues. Some pedons lack a lithologic discontinuity within soil material above bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Albrights series is the only soil in the same family. Albrights soils have redder sola hues of 5YR and 2.5YR and coarse fragments of shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone.\nSoils in the closely-related active CEC activity class are the Amwell, Canfield, Nockamixon, Rittman, Teegarden (T), and Urbana series. Amwell soils have rock fragments that are dominantly basic igneous rocks. Canfield soils are strongly to extremely acid in the argillic horizon and have coarse fragments of sandstone and shale. Nockamixon soils are moderately acid to neutral in the substratum. Rittman soils have clay loam or silty clay loam in some or all parts of the particle-size control section. Teegarden soils are very strongly acid or strongly acid in the substratum. Urbana soils have sola less than 40 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Turbotville soils occupy nearly level to gently sloping upland areas, stream terraces, waterways and depressions.  The upper part of the solum typically consists of glacial or stream deposits largely of mixed granitic and limestone material. The lower part of the solum and substratum typically consists of mostly weathered limestone.  Depth to limestone bedrock is typically 5 to 20 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Annual air temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches.  Frost free days are 140 to 190."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Annandale, Bartley, Califon, Cokesbury, Duffield, Edneyville (Gladstone) and Washington soils. Annandale, Duffield, Edneyville and Washington soils lack redoximorphic features within 40 inches (are well drained).  Annandale, Califon, Cokesbury, and Edneyville (Gladstone) soils have lower base saturation and have rock fragments dominated by granitic gneiss throughout. Bartley soils lack iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less within the upper 16 inches of the soil. Cokesbury soils have low chroma matrix colors in the upper part of the argillic horizon and redoximorphic features within the upper 16 inches of the soil."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper solum (above the fragipan) and moderately low or moderately high in the lower solum (fragipan). Permeability (obsolete) is moderately slow or slow in the fragipan, and moderate above. Index surface runoff class is high or very high (depending on slope)."

  "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT": {
    "section": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT",
    "content": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Turbotville soils are located in the Highlands section of the Appalachian Province in New Jersey (central New Jersey) and possibly in eastern Pennsylvania (generally, MLRA 148 - Northern Piedmont) associated with remnants of older (Kansan or Illinoisan) glacial periods. This series is of small extent, with about 4500 acres identified."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Turbotville series were classified as Gray Brown Podzolic soils in the 1938 classification system.\nThe 01/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement (semiactive) is based on similar soils having characterization data (Washington and Bartley soils). Seven characterization pedons had control section CEC-7/clay ratios ranging from .19 to .37, with four semiactive and three subactive. The pedon description was updated to current horizon nomenclature and redoximorphic feature terminology. Competing series section was also updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (A and BE horizons)\nb) Argillic horizon - zone from 8 to 36 inches (Bt and Btx horizons)\nc) Fragipan - the zone from 20 to 36 inches (Btx horizon) that is extremely firm and has weak very coarse prismatic structure\nd) Lithologic discontinuity at 50 inches (top of 2C horizon)\ne) Lithic contact at 96 inches (top of 2R horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: No characterization pedons are available for this series.\nMLRA: 148\nREVISED: 04/81-CFJ, CFE; 01/2006-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
