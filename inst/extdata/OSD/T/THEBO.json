  "OVERVIEW": "The Thebo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from consolidated or semiconsolidated shale or from clay lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
