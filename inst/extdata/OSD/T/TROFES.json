  "OVERVIEW": "The Trofes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources. Trofes soils are on low stream terraces of basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
