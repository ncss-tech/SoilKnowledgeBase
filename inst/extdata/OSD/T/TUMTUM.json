  "STATES": "NV,OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tumtum series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Tumtum soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, fan piedmonts, and terraces. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
