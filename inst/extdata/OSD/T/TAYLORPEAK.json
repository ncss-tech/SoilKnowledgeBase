  "OVERVIEW": "The Taylorpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rocks. Taylorpeak soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
