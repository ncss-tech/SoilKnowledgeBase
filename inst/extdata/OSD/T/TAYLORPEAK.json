    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Taylorpeak soils are on convex summit and shoulder positions on ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 5 to 855 meters. These soils formed in residuum weathered from strongly to very strongly cemented sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rocks. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2280 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 330 days."
