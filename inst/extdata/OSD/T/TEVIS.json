  "OVERVIEW": "The Tevis series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in outwash or colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite. These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
