The content of sand coarser than very fine sand exceeds 15 percent. These soils do not have rock fragments in the particle-size control section. These soils have carbonates in all parts.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, moist and 4 or 5, dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 12 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sand, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
