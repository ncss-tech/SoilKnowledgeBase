  "OVERVIEW": "The Tafuna series consists of deep well-drained soils on uplands. These soils formed in surface accumulation of organic matter over fragmental Aa lava. Slope is 3 to 15 percent. Elevation is near sea level to 150 feet. The mean annual rainfall is about 150 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F.",

The mean annual rainfall is 120 to 175 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F."
