  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tafuna soils are extremely stony and have irregular topography because of the underlying lava flow. They are on uplands. The general slopes are gentle to moderate. Slope is 3 to 15 percent. These soils formed in surface accumulation of organic matter over fragmental Aa lava. Elevation is near sea level to 150 feet. The mean annual rainfall is 120 to 175 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F."
