  "OVERVIEW": "The Thow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, pumice, and loess overlying glacial till.  Thow soils are on foothills and mountainsides on generally northerly aspects. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent including 5 to 35 percent pumice 2 mm to 10 mm in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 40 to 80 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  Some pedons have a thin discontinuous C horizon having value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  This C horizon is assumed to be a relatively fresh deposit of Glacier Peak ash.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma is 1 through 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is paragravelly ashy sandy loam or paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Texture is paragravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, paragravelly ashy sandy loam, or paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or most.  Texture is extremely cobbly loamy sand, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, or very gravelly loamy coarse sand."
