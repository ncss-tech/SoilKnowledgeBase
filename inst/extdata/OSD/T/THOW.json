The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent including 5 to 35 percent pumice 2 mm to 10 mm in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 40 to 80 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  Some pedons have a thin discontinuous C horizon having value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  This C horizon is assumed to be a relatively fresh deposit of Glacier Peak ash.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma is 1 through 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is paragravelly ashy sandy loam or paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Texture is paragravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, paragravelly ashy sandy loam, or paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or most.  Texture is extremely cobbly loamy sand, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, or very gravelly loamy coarse sand."
