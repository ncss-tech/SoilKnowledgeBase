  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to hard shale or siltstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments, mostly channers of shale or siltstone, range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and from 25 to 75 in the C horizon. Coverage of surface stones ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly to extremely acid, except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 4. The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Fine-earth texture is similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Fine-earth texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Some pedons are variegated with lithochromic mottles in shades of red or brown.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon and lithochromic mottles that include shades of gray.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Lithochromic mottles in shades of red, brown or gray are common. Fine-earth texture is silty clay, clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a thin Cr horizon 3 to 6 inches thick.\nThe R horizon is hard fissile shale or siltstone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Boden, Braddock, Buffstat, Christian, Clifton, Clover, Danripple, Flagspring, Goresville, Groseclose, Howell, Muse, Rapidan, Sequoia, Totier and Unison series; the tentative Casville, Mount Rush, Spears Mountain  and Yellowbottom series; and the inactive Warminster series. All of these soils are more than 40 inches to hard bedrock with the exception of the Mount Rush, Sequoia and Spears Mountain series. The Mount Rush and Spears Mountain series weathered from metamorphic or igneous rock. The Sequoia series is a close competitor, but has paralithic contact above 40 inches with soft shale or siltstone and is not commonly associated with black shale."

Annual temperature ranges from about 53 to 57 degrees F. with a mean of 54 degrees. Annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches with a mean of 47 inches."
