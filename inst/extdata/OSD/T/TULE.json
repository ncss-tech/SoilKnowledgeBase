This soil is usually dry, but it is moist in April, May, and early June.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine earth is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline."
