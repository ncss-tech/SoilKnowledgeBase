  "OVERVIEW": "The Ticanot series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from basalt on foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 65 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
