Elevation ranges from 1,465 to 2,170 meters.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and spring rain.  The average annual temperature is 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
