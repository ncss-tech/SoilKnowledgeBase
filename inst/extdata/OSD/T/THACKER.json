  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Thacker series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Thacker soils are on piedmonts, fan terraces and alluvial terraces and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C.",
