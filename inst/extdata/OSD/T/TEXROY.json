  "OVERVIEW": "The Texroy series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvium and eolian deposits of late-Pleistocene to early Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces. Slope range is 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm (20 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
