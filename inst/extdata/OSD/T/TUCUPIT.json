  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tucupit series consists of deep and very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Tucupit soils are on canyon sides and escarpments.  Slopes range from 20 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
