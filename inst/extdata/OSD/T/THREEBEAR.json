  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Threebear series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. They are mountain slopes, structural benches, and hills on plateaus. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low and slopes range from 3 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 36 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
