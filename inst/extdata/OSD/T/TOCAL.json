  "OVERVIEW": "The Tocal series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils formed in eolian material over residuum weathered from rhyolitic tuff on shoulders of interfluves on undulating plateaus and mesas.  Permeability is moderately slow or slow.  Slopes are 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

(Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact: Tuff at 14 inches. (2Cr layer)\nIn February 2002 the lithic contact was changed to a paralithic contact, the taxonomic class was changed from Lithic Haplustalfs to shallow Typic Haplustalfs, the temperature regime was changed from frigid to mesic, and the CEA class was changed from active to superactive. These changes were recommended following fieldwork on the Bandelier National Monument.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Clay mineralogy determined by National Soil Survey Laboratory, Sample No. R74-296.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
