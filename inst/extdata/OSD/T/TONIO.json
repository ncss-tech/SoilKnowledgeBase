Woody plants include mesquite, black brush, white brush, guayacan, twisted acacia, lotebush, allthorn, goatbush, Texas persimmon, wolfberry, guajillo, leatherstem, and pricklypear. Forbes, such as rat ear and Russian thistle are common. The ecological site is Gray Sandy Loam 18-25 PZ (R083BY421TX)."
