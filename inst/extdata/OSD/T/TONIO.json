  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonio series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy residuum weathered from sandstone of the Eocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on valley sides and floors.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in).",
