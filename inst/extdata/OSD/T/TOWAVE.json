  "OVERVIEW": "The Towave series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Towave soils are on north facing hillslopes.  Slopes range from 45 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
