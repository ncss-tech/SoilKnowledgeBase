  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Titiack soils are on cinder cones and adjacent volcanic plateaus.  They formed in eolian material derived from mixed rocks and basaltic ash over basaltic cinder deposits.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,590 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
