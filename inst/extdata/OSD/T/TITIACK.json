  "OVERVIEW": "The Titiack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from mixed rocks and basaltic ash over basaltic cinder deposits.  Titiack soils are on cinder cones and adjacent volcanic plateaus.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
