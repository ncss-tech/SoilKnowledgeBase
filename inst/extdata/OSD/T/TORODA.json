  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice. Soil reaction is neutral to slightly acid. The thickness of mollic epipedon exceeds 20 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges form 39 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is less than 59 degrees F. The upper part of the control section contains more than 30 percent volcanic glass in the fine earth fraction. The lower part of the control section contains more than 35 percent rock fragments, and from 25 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, range in values of 2 moist, 2 or 3 dry, and chroma of 1 moist and 1 or 2 dry. It is gravelly ashy silt loam and has weak structure.\nThe 2BA and 2Bw horizons are in 10YR hue, range in values of 3 or 4 moist, 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. They are loam or clay loam and are gravelly, cobbly, or stony and have moderate or weak blocky structure."
