Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface mixed to 7 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 17 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3 horizons); and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2, Bw3, BC, C1, part of C2 horizon).  Teigen soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nClassification changed from Borollic Camborthids to Aridic Ustochrepts in 1993.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
