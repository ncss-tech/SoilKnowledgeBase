  "OVERVIEW": "The Teigen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from acid fissile shales.  These soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
