  "OVERVIEW": "The Triplett series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loess or loess and alluvium. These soils are on high flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Crestmeade and Edina soils contain less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the solum. Fillmore soils are not dry in any part of the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice and commonly have free carbonates at depths of less than 60 inches. Massie soils are not dry in any part of the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice Scott soils are not dry in any part of the soil moisture control section for more than 10 days during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Sperry soils average less than 54 degrees F. at the series temperature control depth.  Chariton soils have value of 4 or more in the upper part of the Bt horizon."

Tina, Wiota, and Shannondale soils do not have albic E horizons and Wiota and Shannondale soils have a fine-silty control section. They occur on similar positions as the Triplett soils. Gifford soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on flood plain escarpments below the Triplett soils."
