    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barbert, Chauncey, Crestmeade, Edina, Fillmore, Massie, Plankinton, Rolfe, Scott, and Sperry series. A similar soil is the Chariton series. Barbert, Plankinton and Rolfe soils average less than 51 degrees F. at the series temperature control depth.  Chauncey soils have an E horizon thicker than 11 inches. Crestmeade and Edina soils contain less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the solum. Fillmore soils are not dry in any part of the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice and commonly have free carbonates at depths of less than 60 inches. Massie soils are not dry in any part of the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice Scott soils are not dry in any part of the soil moisture control section for more than 10 days during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Sperry soils average less than 54 degrees F. at the series temperature control depth.  Chariton soils have value of 4 or more in the upper part of the Bt horizon."

The soils formed in loess or loess and the underlying silty alluvium. The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 38 inches."

Tina, Wiota, and Shannondale soils do not have albic E horizons and Wiota and Shannondale soils have a fine-silty control section. They occur on similar positions as the Triplett soils. Gifford soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on flood plain escarpments below the Triplett soils."
