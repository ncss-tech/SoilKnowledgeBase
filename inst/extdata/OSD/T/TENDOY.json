  "OVERVIEW": "The Tendoy series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in material derived from herbaceous plants.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
