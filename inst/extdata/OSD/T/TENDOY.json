    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bucksport, Lupton, Pywell, and Seeleyville series.   Lupton soils contain up to 30 percent woody fragments and lack calcium carbonate in the upper part of the surface tier.  Pywell soils have thin layers of volcanic ash, contain up to 35 percent woody material, and lack calcium carbonate in the upper part of the surface tier.  Seeleyville soils lack calcium carbonate in the upper part of the surface tier.  Bucksport soils are extremely acid to strongly acid in the surface tier and extremely acid to moderately acid in the subsurface tier."

Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days.  Elevation ranges from 4,550 to 4,750 feet."

Downata is a mineral soil but may have thin buried organic layers.  These soils are also on floodplains but occupy slightly higher positions and have better drainage."
