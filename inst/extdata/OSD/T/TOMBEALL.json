  "OVERVIEW": "The Tombeall series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low stream terraces and flood plains.  They formed in alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",
