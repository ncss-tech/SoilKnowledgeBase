  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Usually the soils are calcareous throughout, but they are leached for an inch or two in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Content of organic carbon in the surface horizon ranges from .1 to .6 percent and decreases uniformly with depth.  The control section ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, but are typically less than 5 percent and consist mainly of fine gravel or sandstone fragments.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is mildly to strongly alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.6).  This horizon is loose to soft.  The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6) and contains from less than 1 to about 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Visible accumulation of secondary carbonates occur at any depth but are not concentrated in a consistent horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tipper soils are on gently to moderately sloping upland hills and ridges.  Slope gradients typically range from 2 to 15.  The soils formed in moderately thick, coarse textured, calcareous parent sediments derived in part from weathering of sedimentary rock and partly from eolian deposits overlying sedimentary rock.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer months.  The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F."
