  "OVERVIEW": "The Tornero series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that develop on linear or curvilinear dunes on the eastern margin of playa basins on the Southern High Plains.  These soils formed in calcareous eolian sediments of Late Pleistocene to Holocene age.  Mean annual precipitation is 406 m (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F). Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.",
