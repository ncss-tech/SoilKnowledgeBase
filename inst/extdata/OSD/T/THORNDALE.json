  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in all horizons. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Soil reaction, unless limed, ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the solum and moderately acid through neutral in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture of the fine earth is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 3. It has redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown and yellow. Texture of the fine earth ranges from silty clay loam or silt loam. The Btx horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 3. It has redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown and yellow. Texture of the fine earth is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 6. It has redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown and yellow.  Texture of the fine earth ranges from silt loam to clay.\nSome pedons have transitional BA or BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Croton, Doylestown, and Sheffield series. Croton soils formed in medium textured materials mainly over sandstone, siltstone, or shale. Doylestown soils have B horizons which have less clay and sand and more silt and rock fragments than the Thorndale soils. Sheffield soils have calcareous C horizons of glacial till.\nBrinkerton, Calvert, Ginat and Robertsville are soils in closely related families. Brinkerton soils formed in acid siltstone and shale materials. Calvert soils have thinner solum and bedrock at depths of 36 to 60 inches. Ginat soils contain mica and have formed in medium and coarse textured alluvium. Robertsville soils do not have argillic horizons above the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thorndale soils are on uplands in shallow depressions and drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils developed in medium textured colluvium from limestone or calcareous shale and siltstone. Rainfall ranges from 32 to 48 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F., and the growing season ranges from 120 to 200 days."

All except Bedford, Clarksburg and Lawrence soils lack fragipans. Bedford soils are moderately well drained and have dominant chroma of more than 4 in the Bt horizon. Lawrence and Clarksburg soils have Bt horizons with chroma of more than 3. The Penlaw series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in colluvium derived primarily from limestone but with some shale and sandstone."
