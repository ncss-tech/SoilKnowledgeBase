  "OVERVIEW": "The Tulert series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from limestone and volcanic rocks.  Tulert soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 1/4 F.",
