Mean annual soil temperature is about 63 1/4 to 66 1/4 F.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR.  The average gravel content ranges from 25 to 35 percent by volume.\nThe B2t horizon has chroma of 4 or 6 dry.  The average texture is loam or sandy loam with less than l8 percent clay and less than l5 percent rock fragments.  Subhorizons of loam, sandy clay loam or sandy loam with more than l8 percent clay are in most pedons."

They formed from moderately coarse tex tured alluvium weathered from mostly limestone and mixed volcanic rocks.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is hot and arid with a mean annual precipitation of 6 to 8 inches; mean annual temperature of 59 1/4 to 62 1/4 F.; and a frost-free season of about 200 to 2l0 days."
