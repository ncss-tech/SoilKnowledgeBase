The name was selected by professors at Southern Mississippi University named after one of their research vessels.  The name originates from a combination of Thalassia and Callinectes, the genera for turtlegrass and blue crab, respectively.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nPeraquic moisture regime--The zone from 0 to 200 centimeters has positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 144 centimeters of salt water).\nParticle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches).\nFluventic Feature--soil organic carbon content of greater than 0.2 percent at a depth of 125 centimeters.\nTaxonomic version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th edition (2022)"
