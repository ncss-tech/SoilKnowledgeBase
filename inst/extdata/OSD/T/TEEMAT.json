(A1, A2 horizons)\nSecondary carbonate accumulations:  from 10 to 60 inches.  (Bk horizon); this horizon is presumed to have less than 5 percent carbonate equivalent in all subhorizons, hence not a calcic horizon.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (upper part of Bk horizon)\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nThese soils were previously classified as Chernozems. When proposed the Teemat series was classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryoborolls.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
