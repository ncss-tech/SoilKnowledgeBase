  "OVERVIEW": "The Tomsherry series consists of very deep, moderately deep to a duripan, well-drained soils that are formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash.  They are on fan terraces and plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
