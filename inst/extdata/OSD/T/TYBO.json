  "OVERVIEW": "The Tybo series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, andesite, basalt, and welded tuff. Tybo soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
