    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,990 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."
