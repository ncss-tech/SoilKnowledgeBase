  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick, depth to calcareous material ranges from 8 to 20 inches, the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches thick and depth to the shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated. Cation exchange capacity ranges from 30 to 60 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Rock fragments are typically less than 2 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F. without an 0 horizon. The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2. It usually has granular or crumb structure but has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and neutral or slightly alkaline. The Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is 60 to 100 percent clay, 0 to 40 percent silt, and 0 to 40 percent sand.  This horizon usually has prismatic structure but has angular blocky structure in some pedons. Oriented clay films occur in some part. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and it is weakly calcareous in the lower part in some pedons. The Ck horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR. It has approximately 2 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Slopes usually range from 0 to about 15 percent. These soils formed in fine textured materials weathered residually from underlying clay shales. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.
