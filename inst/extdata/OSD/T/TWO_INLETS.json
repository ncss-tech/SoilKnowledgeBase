    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 40 inches. Content of rock fragments, by volume, ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the A, E and Bt horizons, and from 10 to 35 percent in the C horizon. Some thin subhorizons have up to 50 percent rock fragments. Rock fragments typically range from 2 millimeters to 4 centimeters. Some phases have .01 to 3 percent of the surface covered with cobbles or stones. The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice. In addition, it is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or gravelly coarse sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a thin EB, BE or B/E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy very coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. Thin lamellae of sandy loam are included but do not exceed three inches in cumulative thickness in the series control section. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have E&Bt horizons.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand, gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand or gravelly very coarse sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon with hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand, gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand, or gravelly very coarse sand. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 10 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or convex slopes on outwash plains, stream terraces, valley trains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 65 percent. These soils formed in glacial outwash of Late Wisconsin Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 23 to 28 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,800 feet above sea level."

The poorly drained Epoufette soils are on low-lying, nearly level areas. The moderately well drained Bluffcreek and Karlstad soils are on low-lying, gently sloping areas. The very poorly drained Markey, Nidaros, Rifle, and Seeleyville soils are in depressions. The well drained Lida and Sugarbush soils are on similar positions but have a finer textured argillic horizon."
