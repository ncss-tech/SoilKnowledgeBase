    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Soils in the same family include the Chilmark, Hassler, Roselle, and Tulip series. The Birdsboro and Brumbaugh series are in closely related families. Chilmark soils formed in a loamy or sandy aeolian mantle over coastal plain sediments on the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in MLRA 149B. Hassler soils are deep to granite bedrock and formed in colluvium and residuum on mountain ridges in the Ozark Highland area (MLRA 116A). Roselle soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granite on terraces and footslopes in mountain basins in the Ozark Highland area (MLRA 116A). Tulip soils formed in colluvium from sandstone and siltstone and in residuum from underlying shale in south-central Indiana (MLRA 120). The Birdsboro soils formed in old alluvial deposits from shale, sandstone, or siltstone. The Brumbaugh soils formed in colluvium from metamorphic rocks and have a lithologic discontinuity from 30 to 60 inches."

Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent, but commonly are 2 to 15 percent. The soils developed in colluvium and alluvium derived from a mixture of metamorphic rocks. Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 57 degrees. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 62 inches."
