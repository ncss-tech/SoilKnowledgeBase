Where present, depth to a lithologic discontinuity ranges from 30 to 80 inches. Rock fragments are low- to high-grade metamorphic rocks typically consisting of partially rounded and angular quartzite, granite, and other crystalline rocks up to 10 inches in diameter range from 0 to 50 percent in the A and C horizons and from 0 to 35 percent in the B horizon. The soil is very strongly or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 are less than 6 inches thick. The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam that in the fine earth fraction.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. The AB or BA horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam that in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. The E horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less occur deeper than 24 inches of the upper boundary of the Bt horizon. Soft masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red may also be present. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction. The lower part of the Bt horizon is free of mottles in some pedons.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has matrix colors similar to the Bt horizon or it is streaked or mottled in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray. It is generally coarser in texture and contains a higher content of rock fragments than the Bt horizon. It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon commonly is streaked or mottled with hue of 2.5YR throuth 10YR, value of 2 through 8 and chroma of 1 through 7. It ranges from sandy loam to clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has matrix colors and textures similar to the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Soils in the same family include the Chilmark, Hassler, Roselle, and Tulip series. The Birdsboro and Brumbaugh series are in closely related families. Chilmark soils formed in a loamy or sandy aeolian mantle over coastal plain sediments on the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in MLRA 149B. Hassler soils are deep to granite bedrock and formed in colluvium and residuum on mountain ridges in the Ozark Highland area (MLRA 116A). Roselle soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granite on terraces and footslopes in mountain basins in the Ozark Highland area (MLRA 116A). Tulip soils formed in colluvium from sandstone and siltstone and in residuum from underlying shale in south-central Indiana (MLRA 120). The Birdsboro soils formed in old alluvial deposits from shale, sandstone, or siltstone. The Brumbaugh soils formed in colluvium from metamorphic rocks and have a lithologic discontinuity from 30 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thurmont soils are on footslopes, colluvial fans, benches, and stream terraces in the Blue Ridge mountains (MLRA 130) and Northern Piedmont (MLRA 148). Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent, but commonly are 2 to 15 percent. The soils developed in colluvium and alluvium derived from a mixture of metamorphic rocks. Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 57 degrees. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 62 inches."

Braddock and Unison soils have a fine particle-size control section. Dillard soils have iron depletions within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon. Meadowville soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the control section with significant increase in sand content. Statler and Tate soils have a seasonal high water table greater than 6 feet. Trego soils have a fragipan."
