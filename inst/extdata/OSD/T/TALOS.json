The mean annual air  temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The driest months are March and April. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.  Elevation ranges from 3,900 to 4,050 feet.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."

Elizario and Mcnew soils are on slightly depressed and slightly higher positions respectively of the alluvial flat of the basin floor.  Peligro soils have gypsic horizons near the surface and formed in eolian gypsiferous sediments on lunettes or parna dunes."
