  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tellura soils are on high structural benches, fans, mountain slopes, and toe slopes.  They formed in formed in very gravelly and cobbly colluvium or slope alluvium derived mainly from andesite, breccia, tuff, and shale, and in some places influenced from basalt.  The type location is believed to be in an area of Mancos shale. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 8300 to 11,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 25 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation in all months. In central Colorado, peak periods of precipitation are in spring and summer. Mean annual temperature is 32 to 44 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 50 to 80 days."

It is currently considered to have an ustic regime, but a udic regime bordering ustic cannot be ruled out. The 2/1999 revision to an Ustic subgroup did not agree with the moisture regime given at that time as \"udic bordering ustic\"; this was changed to simply \"ustic regime\" on the 01/2010 revision.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This series has been sampled by the NSSL but results do not support the series, either because of insufficient clay, or by not having smectitic mineralogy, or by classifying in the Alfic subgroup.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
