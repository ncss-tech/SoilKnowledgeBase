  "OVERVIEW": "The Tellura series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium derived mainly from andesite, breccia, tuff, and shale. Tellura soils are on high structural benches, fans, mountain slopes, and toe slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

They formed in formed in very gravelly and cobbly colluvium or slope alluvium derived mainly from andesite, breccia, tuff, and shale, and in some places influenced from basalt.  The type location is believed to be in an area of Mancos shale. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 8300 to 11,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 25 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation in all months. In central Colorado, peak periods of precipitation are in spring and summer. Mean annual temperature is 32 to 44 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 50 to 80 days."

Baird Hollow soils have an argillic horizon that has its upper boundary deeper than 24 inches.  Ceek soils are frigid.  Nordicol soils have less than 35 percent clay in their particle-size control section.  Skisams soils have a lithic contact above 20 inches."

It is currently considered to have an ustic regime, but a udic regime bordering ustic cannot be ruled out. The 2/1999 revision to an Ustic subgroup did not agree with the moisture regime given at that time as \"udic bordering ustic\"; this was changed to simply \"ustic regime\" on the 01/2010 revision."
