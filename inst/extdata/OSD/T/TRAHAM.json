  "OVERVIEW": "The Traham series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from basalt.  Traham soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 8 to 90 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 49 degrees F.  The soil is strongly acid or moderately acid.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Organic carbon is more than 4 percent in the upper 2/3 of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It has subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry.  It is gravelly medial clay loam or very gravelly medial silty clay loam and contains 40 to 55 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is medium to very fine subangular blocky structure."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from Eocene age basalt.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and relatively cool, dry summers.  The annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. and the growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 220 days."
