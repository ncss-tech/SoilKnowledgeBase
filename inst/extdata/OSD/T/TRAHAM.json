    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured basalt ranges from 24 to 36 inches.  The particle size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments that are mostly pebble size.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 49 degrees F.  The soil is strongly acid or moderately acid.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Organic carbon is more than 4 percent in the upper 2/3 of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It has subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry.  It is gravelly medial clay loam or very gravelly medial silty clay loam and contains 40 to 55 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is medium to very fine subangular blocky structure."

Katula soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments which are mostly cobbles and have less than 4 percent organic carbon in the upper part of the control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from Eocene age basalt.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and relatively cool, dry summers.  The annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. and the growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 220 days."

Knappton soils are medial and have basalt at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Lates and Murnen soils have a frigid temperature.  Vesta soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the profile and are more than 60 inches deep in basalt."
