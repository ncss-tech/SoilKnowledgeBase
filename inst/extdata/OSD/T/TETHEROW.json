    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry and are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 120 to 150 days (cumulative) after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Solum thickness and depth to cinders is 14 to 28 inches.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.  The upper part (solum) contains 15 to 30 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, and the acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.40 to 0.80 percent.  Phosphate retention is 15 to 25 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.  The solum contains 5 to 10 percent clay and 55 to 75 percent sand dominantly very fine and fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe AC horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is ashy sandy loam or cobbly ashy sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR and 5YR, value of 3 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It contains 90 to 100 percent cinders (greater than 2.0 millimeters).  In some pedons, this horizon has thin brittle discontinuous layers."
