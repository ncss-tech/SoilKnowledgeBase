  "OVERVIEW": "The Trix series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over buried argillic horizons.  Trix soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains with slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.",
