Potential competitors still classified as Borolls are the Beartooth, Beeno, Bookcliff, and Sponseller soils. Beartooth, Beeno, Dooley, Doughty, Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Gurney, Kokoruda, Martinsdale, Meagher, Ulrant, Watne, Williams, and Yegen soils have secondary carbonate accumulations above 40 inches.  Farside soils have mean annual soil temperature of 39 to 43 degrees F. The Felor, Greenway, and Livona soils have lithologic discontinuities and lime carbonates above 40 inches.  Hyalite soils contain more than 40 percent rock fragments in the 2Bt horizon and below.  Clasoil soils are derived from granitic rocks.  The Absarook, Archmesa, Burtoner, Clancy, Hoppers, Jeffcity, Moento, Pianohill, Placerton, Reeder, and Reedwest soils have a paralithic or lithic contact between 20 to 40 inches. Trazuni soils have mottles in the lower part of the profile.  The Bielenberg and Snakejohn soils have lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.  The Maudlin, Moen, and Watrous soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Bookcliff and Vida soils have lime carbonates, chroma depth of 40 inches, and sola to the base of the Bt is less than 20 inches.  The Hangdo series has more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the lower subsoil or substratum.  Sponseller series have hues redder than 7.5YR in the lower solum."
