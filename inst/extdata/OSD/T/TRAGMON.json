  "REVDATE": "12/2004",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tragmon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, and alluvium from sandstone and shale.  Tragmon soils are on hills, canyons, mesas, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
