  "OVERVIEW": "The Tidwell series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, limestone and shale.  They are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Delgado (CA), Langwell (CA), Ripsey (AZ), Splanod (AZ), and Trigger (CA) series.  Ripsey soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods due to a higher rainfall component.  Splanod soils average more than 18 percent clay.  Delgado, Langwell, and Trigger soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), receive mostly winter precipitation, and are usually dry from April through November.  Trigger soils have a paralithic contact above the lithic contact and should be classified as shallow Typic Torriorthents."
