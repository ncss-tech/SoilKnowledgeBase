  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Delgado (CA), Langwell (CA), Ripsey (AZ), Splanod (AZ), and Trigger (CA) series.  Ripsey soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods due to a higher rainfall component.  Splanod soils average more than 18 percent clay.  Delgado, Langwell, and Trigger soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), receive mostly winter precipitation, and are usually dry from April through November.  Trigger soils have a paralithic contact above the lithic contact and should be classified as shallow Typic Torriorthents."

The soils formed on interbedded calcareous sandstone, limestone and shale of lacustrine origin that is high in quartz and feldspars.  Tidwell soils are at elevations of 2,600 to 3,400.  Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 195 to 255 days."
