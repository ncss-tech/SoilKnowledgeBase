The parent materials are mainly from limestone. These soils occur in moist subhumid climate. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 to 26 inches with a summer maximum. Mean annual temperature is about36 to 41 degrees F. with a summer average soil temperature colder than 59 degrees F. The Thornthwaite P-E Index is about 45 to 60."
