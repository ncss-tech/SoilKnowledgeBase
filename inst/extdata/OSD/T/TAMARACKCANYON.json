    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has a phosphate retention of 20 to 40 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and volcanic glass of 10 to 30 percent.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  The soil reaction is moderately or slightly acid throughout except for the lower part of the 2Bt which is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 5 moist, 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  The texture is ashy loam, ashy clay loam or ashy silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.

The soils formed in ash with an influence of loess over clayey basalt colluvium.  Elevation is 2800 to 6200 feet; 2800 to 5400 feet on north slopes and 4000 to 6200 feet on south slopes.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
