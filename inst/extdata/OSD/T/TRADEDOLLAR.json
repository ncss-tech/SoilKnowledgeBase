  "OVERVIEW": "The Tradedollar series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in aerially deposited dacitic pumice with recent volcanic ash. Tradedollar soils are in upland basins, mountainslopes and broad ridgetops at elevations of 2,800 to 5,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

These soils formed in a layer of aerially deposited dacitic pumice with a mantle of more recently deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  The pumice layer is the Mt. St. Helens \"layer Y\", deposited about 3,200 years ago.  The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cold wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches including considerable snowfall.  Mean annual temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 70 to 90 days."
