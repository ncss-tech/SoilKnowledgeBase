  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tradedollar soils are in upland basins, on mountainsides, and broad ridgetops at elevations of 2,800 to 5,400 feet.   Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in a layer of aerially deposited dacitic pumice with a mantle of more recently deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  The pumice layer is the Mt. St. Helens \"layer Y\", deposited about 3,200 years ago.  The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cold wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches including considerable snowfall.  Mean annual temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 70 to 90 days."
