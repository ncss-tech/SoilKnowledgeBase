    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the Bt horizon is 11 to 20 inches and depth to the base of the Btk and the nonskeletal substratum is 18 to 32 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F. The soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section in April, May and early June and dry in all parts for the 90 consecutive days following July 15 in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. Coarse fragments range from 15 to 35 percent pebbles and 0 to 40 percent cobbles. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. The texture of the fine earth is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. Coarse fragments range form 25 to 60 percent pebbles and 0 to 20 percent cobbles. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 through 7 moist and chroma of 3 through 6. The texture of the fine earth is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam modified with 25 to 65 percent pebbles and 0 to 35 percent cobbles. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. Coarse fragments are typically absent but range from 0 to 5 percent. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the upper part and decreases with depth. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in gravelly alluvium overlying soft sedimentary bedrock. Slopes are 6 to 15 percent. Elevations are 7,000 feet to 7,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May and early June. The mean annual temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 85 to 110 days."
