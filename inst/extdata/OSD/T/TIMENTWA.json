Conconully and Dezellem soils are on ground moraines.  Duleylake soils are in basins on till plains.  Emdent soils are in bottomlands and basins.  Siweeka soils are on till plains.  All of these soils lack a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick.  In addition, Badge soils are loamy-skeletal and have an argillic horizon.   Bakeoven soils are less than 10 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Benge and Haley soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Colockum and Duleylake soils are fine-loamy.  Conconully and Picard soils lack secondary lime within 44 inches of the surface.  Emdent soils are Halaquepts.  Siweeka soils have duripan at 20 to 40 inches."

NSSL pedon number 84P0167 and 89P0212.  Glass count for very fine sand fraction is 18 to 27 percent.  Estimated glass count for coarse silt and fine sand is 18 to 27 percent.  Because of sand size pumice and coarse volcanic ash from Glacier Peak, the following are estimated glass counts for sand fractions - medium sand is 50 percent, coarse sand is 75 percent and very coarse sand is 80 percent glass.  Calculated weighted average is 30 to 40 percent glass in the upper part of the particle-size control section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
