  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Toadlena series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to soft siltstone. Toadlena soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from interbedded siltstone and shale on footslopes of structural benches. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 6,100 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches about half of which falls as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
