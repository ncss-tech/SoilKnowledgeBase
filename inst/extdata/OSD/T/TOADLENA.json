    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toadlena soils are on footslopes of structural benches. They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Cretaceous siltstone and shale. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 6,100 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches about half of which falls as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Farview soils are very shallow over hard sandstone bedrock and occur on structural benches and dipslopes of cuestas. Sanostee soils are moderately deep to sandstone and occur on toeslopes."
