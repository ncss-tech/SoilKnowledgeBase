  "OVERVIEW": "The Turkeytrack series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces and fan terraces of plateaus.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
