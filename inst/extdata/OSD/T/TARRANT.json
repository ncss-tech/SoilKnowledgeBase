  "OVERVIEW": "The Tarrant series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to indurated limestone bedrock, interbedded with marl and chalk. These well drained soils formed in residuum derived from limestone of Cretaceous age. These nearly level to very steep soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly rangeland and wildlife habitat. The climax plant community is a tall grass savannah with motts of live oak throughout the landscape. The dominant grasses are little bluestem and sideoats grama.  Other grasses include yellow Indiangrass, fall witchgrass, wildrye, green sprangletop, meadow dropseed, cane and pinhole bluestem, hairy grama, Texas wintergrass, curly mesquite and buffalograss. Woody plants include live oak, shin oak, evergreen sumac, hackberry, elbowbush, redbud, and white honeysuckle. Forbs, such as orange zexmenia, Engelmann daisy, bundleflower, snout bean, and bushsunflower, are present.  With continued over grazing, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population sideoats grama, buffalograss, hairy grama, dropseeds, and the woody plants. If this destructive grazing practice continues, the site will deteriorate to a plant population of Ashe juniper, Texas persimmon, live oak, Texas grama, hairy tridens, curly mesquite, threeawns, prairie coneflower, and broomweed."

Tarrant soils are now limited to the Edwards Plateau materials with a P-E index of 30 to 44.\nThe calcic horizon in the typical pedon is questionable and this series needs to be studied over its full extent and a new typical pedon selected.\nEdited 10/2016 (RFG-THW): Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (A and Ak horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 20 to 33 cm (8 to 13 in) (Ak horizon and the upper few inches of limestone bedrock)\nLithic contact: 33 cm (13 in) (top of R layer)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples from Menard County, TX327, Texas, sampled by SSL, Lincoln, NE, 10/64, include Lab pedon numbers 40A4526 and 40A4527.
