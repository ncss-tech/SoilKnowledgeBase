  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry from 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from l5 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The upper 15 to 30 inches of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The lower part of the control section averages l5 to 35 percent rock fragments and l0 to 40 percent weathered schist or gneiss fragments.  Some pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of l through 3 dry and moist.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is cobbly sandy loam, stony sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  Cobble and stone lines are at the boundary between the B and 2C horizons in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tillicum soils are on mountainsides with generally a northerly aspect at elevations of 1,400 to 4,800 feet.  Slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from gneiss or schist.  They are in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches. The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 63 degrees F.; the average annual temperature is 4l to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to ll0 days.  The growing season, at 28 degrees F.\ni.  about l20 to l50 days."

Ardenmont and Ardenvoir soils lack volcanic ash influence in the control section.  Chumstick and Kloochman soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Saska soils have a spodic horizon and are ashy over loamy-skeletal.  Surgh soils are cryic."
