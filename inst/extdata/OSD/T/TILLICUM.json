  "OVERVIEW": "The Tillicum series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from gneiss or schist. Tillicum soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The upper 15 to 30 inches of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The lower part of the control section averages l5 to 35 percent rock fragments and l0 to 40 percent weathered schist or gneiss fragments.  Some pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of l through 3 dry and moist.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is cobbly sandy loam, stony sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  Cobble and stone lines are at the boundary between the B and 2C horizons in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."
