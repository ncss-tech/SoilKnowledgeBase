The soil moisture control section is usually dry between depths of 10 and 20 inches (25 to 50 centimeters), or to a lithic contact from May to October.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F. (16 to 19 degrees C.).\nThe A horizon is very pale brown or pale brown (10YR 7/3, 6/3, 7/4).  Moist colors are dark brown, grayish brown, brown or pale brown (10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/3).  This horizon is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam or gravelly loam and has 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is strongly effervescent or violently effervescent with disseminated lime.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that is similar in color and texture to the A horizon.\nThe Cr layer is made up of moderately cemented fractured rock with some strongly to violently effervescent, moderately alkaline, sandy loam or loam soil in fracture joints."
