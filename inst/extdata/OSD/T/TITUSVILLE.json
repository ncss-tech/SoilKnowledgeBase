Canfield and Rittman soils formed in till of Wisconsinan age. In addition, Rittman soils are less acid in the lower part of the series control. Teegarden soils formed in loess, till, and in residual parent materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Titusville soils typically are on interfluves or on glaciated benches at the foot of steeper slopes, but also are on hillsides in some areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in weathered Illinoian till dominantly of sandstone and shale materials and in a mantle of loess or silty material as much as 41 cm (16 inches) thick in some areas. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1143 mm (37 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gresham and Hanover soils in a toposequence with Titusville soils and the Alvira, Dekalb, Gilpin, Lordstown, Loudonville, Muskingum, Shelmadine, and Wharton soils. The somewhat poorly drained Gresham soils are on less sloping areas or on higher topographic positions and the well drained Hanover soils are on more sloping areas or on higher topographic positions. In western Pennsylvania, Alvira soils have lower base saturation and are in similar topographic positions as Titusville soils and the poorly drained Shelmadine soils have lower base saturation in low topographic positions or at the head of drainageways. The excessively drained Dekalb soils and the well drained Gilpin, Lordstown, Loudonville, and Muskingum soils have bedrock within a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches), lack fragipans, and often are on steeper slopes above areas of Titusville soils. Wharton soils have low base saturation and are on nearby landscapes that lack glacial erratics."
