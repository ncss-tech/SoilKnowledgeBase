  "OVERVIEW": "The Titusville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in weathered Illinoian till and in a thin mantle of loess in some areas. These soils are on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Gresham soils are on less sloping areas or on higher topographic positions and the well drained Hanover soils are on more sloping areas or on higher topographic positions. In western Pennsylvania, Alvira soils have lower base saturation and are in similar topographic positions as Titusville soils and the poorly drained Shelmadine soils have lower base saturation in low topographic positions or at the head of drainageways. The excessively drained Dekalb soils and the well drained Gilpin, Lordstown, Loudonville, and Muskingum soils have bedrock within a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches), lack fragipans, and often are on steeper slopes above areas of Titusville soils. Wharton soils have low base saturation and are on nearby landscapes that lack glacial erratics."
