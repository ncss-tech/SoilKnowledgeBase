  "OVERVIEW": "The Tracylee series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from noncalcareous sandstone.  Tracylee soils are on upland valley fills, relict alluvial fans, and in basins.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Tracylee soils are typically noncalcareous, but some pedons contain a few fine masses of segregated carbonates below 50 inches.  Depth to the base of the mollic epipedon ranges from 22 to 38 inches.  Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches.  Depth to the base of the Bt horizon is 30 to 44 inches.  Coarse fragments are typically less than 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 20-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nAn AB or BA horizon is present in most pedons.  They have the same range in characteristics as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is typically loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent fine and coarser sand.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry and 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are loam or fine sandy loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline."

Albinas, Renner, and Sampson soils have continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate above depths of 40 inches.  Garrett soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Haxtun soils have buried pedogenic horizons above depths of 40 inches.  Jarita soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Prosper soils have mottling above 40 inches, have Bk horizons, and are moderately well drained.  Keya, Woodly, and Woonsocket soils are more moist in July, August, and September.\n3 - Tracylee Series"

They formed in slope wash alluvial sediments derived from noncalcareous fine grained sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations are 4,800 to 5,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow in April, May, and June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 105 to 130 days."
