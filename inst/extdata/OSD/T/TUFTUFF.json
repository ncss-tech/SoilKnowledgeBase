  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuftuff series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from tuff.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
