    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include Armour, Bernaldo, Bolivar, Bosket, Dexter, Dossman, Hicks, Masada, Sallisaw, and Stiversville series. Armour, Dexter, Dossman, and Hicks soils have less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sandy in the control section. In addition, Armour soils have reddish brown lower B and C horizons and Dossman soils are red throughout the solum. Bernaldo and Sallisaw soils have colors in the upper B horizon that are redder than 10YR hue, and have color values of more than 4; in addition, Bernaldo soils have siliceous mineralogy and Sallisaw soils are very gravelly below about 36 inches. Bolivar soils overlie sandstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Bosket soils have surface layers more than 6 inches thick that have color value of less than 3.5. Masada soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent at 50 inches below the upper boundary of the B horizon. Stiversville soils have phosphatic limestone bedrock at about 45 inches."

The soil formed in mixed loamy alluvium from Coastal Plain Blackland prairie, limestone, and/or sandstone and shale sources. The average annual temperature at the type location is about 63 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is about 48 inches. Flooding occurs about once every 1 to 5 years."

Blevins and Ruston soils are on adjoining uplands and have stronger profile development with B horizons of high chromas. Iuka and Ochlockonee are alluvial soils which lack diagnostic subsurface horizons. Myatt and Ozan soils are poorly drained, gray soils."
