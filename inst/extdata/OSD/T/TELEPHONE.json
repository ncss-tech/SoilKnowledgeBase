Slopes range from 9 to 60 percent but are dominantly 20 to 50 percent. These soils formed in place on noncalcareous sandstone bedrock. The average annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 22 inches and occurs mainly as thunderstorms in July and august and as gentle rains and snow in January and February. The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees to 56 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 110 to 130 days."
