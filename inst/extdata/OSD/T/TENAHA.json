  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenaha series consists of deep, well drained soils.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in sandy and loamy residuum on uplands of the Claiborne geological group.  Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in).",
