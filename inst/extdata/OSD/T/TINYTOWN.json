    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tinytown soils are on alluvial fans, valley sides, and drainageways.  Slope gradients range from 3 to 30 percent. The soils formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived principally from reddish-brown arkose beds of the Fountain and Lyons formations.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and summer. Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Frost free season is 80 to 125 days."
