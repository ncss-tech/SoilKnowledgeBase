Surface layers with value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.

The argillic horizon, typically contains between 18 to 30 percent clay, and over 15 percent and more commonly over 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, typically contains from 18 to 30 percent clay, and from 15 percent to more than 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Teksob soils are on treads and escarpments of terraces in the Western Lowlands of Arkansas (MLRA 131D), and on natural levee positions along the older meander scars in the Lower Mississippi River Valley (MLRA 131A). Many areas are undulating, consisting of low ridges and swales, with Teksob soils on the ridges and wetter soils in the swales. Slopes are dominantly bewteen 0 to 8 percent, but range to 14 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium. Average annual temperature near the type location is about 62 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 51 inches."

Amagon, Bosket, Dexter, Dubbs, Foley and Lafe soils occur on similar terrace positions. Tuckerman soils occur on slightly lower terraces and flood plains. Amagon soils are\npoorly drained and in a fine-silty family. Bonn and Foley soils are poorly drained and have natric horizons. Bosket soils have a mollic epipedon. Dexter and Dubbs soils are in a fine-silty family. Lafe soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a natric horizon. Tuckerman soils are poorly drained."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 2004 to allow chroma 2 color in the surface layer, and chroma 3 color in the upper part of the Bt horizon, and in the C horizon.  Sandy loam texture was also added to the range for the lower part of the Bt horizon, and reaction was allowed to range down to very strongly acid throughout. These changes are supportsd by field and lab documentation from Tunica County, Mississippi. Diagnostic hoizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon-surface to a depth of 20 inches (Ap1, Ap2 and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon-zone from 20 to 40 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nThe Teksob series was created so that the Bosket series could be returned to it's original classification of Mollic Hapludalfs. The Bosket series classification had been changed to Typic Hapludalfs to accommodate correlation in Woodruff County, AR. This previous decision did not take into account all the surveys correlated with mollic epipedons. Therefore, the Teksob series is being created to amend the correlation of these soils in Woodruff County, AR.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Charaterization data by the University of Arkansas Soil Characterization Laboratory.
