  "OVERVIEW": "The Tethrick series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from quartz diorite and gabbro.  Tethrick soils are on mountains and have slopes of 35 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.   These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The control section has 5 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist, 5 through 8 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam."

Gilligan soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and have a silt loam mantle which extends into the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Steinmetz soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Ulricher soils are typically gravelly or cobbly in the B horizon and hue is 10YR throughout.
