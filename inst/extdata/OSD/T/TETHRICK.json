The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.   These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The control section has 5 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist, 5 through 8 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam."

Gilligan soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and have a silt loam mantle which extends into the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Steinmetz soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Ulricher soils are typically gravelly or cobbly in the B horizon and hue is 10YR throughout.  Vader soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and are moderately to very strongly acid throughout."
