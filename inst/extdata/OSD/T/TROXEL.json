  "OVERVIEW": "The Troxel series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty colluvium and in the underlying loamy drift. They are in slight depressions on outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is 8 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
