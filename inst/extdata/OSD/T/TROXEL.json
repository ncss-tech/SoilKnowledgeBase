The series control section ranges from moderately acid to neutral in most parts, but some pedons are slightly alkaline in the lower part. The mollic epipedon ranges from 51 to 114 cm (20 to 45 inches) in thickness.\nThe Ap, A, and/or AB horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam in texture. Some pedons have an AB horizon rather than a BA horizon.\nThe Bt and/or BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt and/or 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or the gravelly analogs of these textures. Strata of coarser textures are sometimes present. Commonly a darker colored, clay enriched subhorizon is present. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent."
