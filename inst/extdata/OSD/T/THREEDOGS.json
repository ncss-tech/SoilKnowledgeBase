    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 30 to 89 cm (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 89 to 180 cm (Bk, Bkk1, and Bkk2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 30 to 80 cm (Btk1 horizon and part of the Btk2 horizon).\nThe revision of June 2008 updated the taxonomic classification from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciargids based on laboratory data.\nThe argillic horizon was formed under previous, moister climatic conditions. It is engulfed in more recent airborne additions of calcium carbonate.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID S05NV-017-006 (pedon # 05N0667).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
