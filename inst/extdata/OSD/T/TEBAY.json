  "OVERVIEW": "The Tebay series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess over glacial till.  Tebay soils are on drumlins, moraines, and undulating glacial till plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the fibrous organic mat ranges from 2 to 5 inches.  Solum thickness ranges from 3 to 8 inches. Texture of the control section includes fine sandy loam, loam, and sandy loam.  There is less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral in the solum and neutral or slightly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3, and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is mucky silt loam, silt loam or silt.  In some pedons, this horizon has patches and strata of organic material, but the average organic matter content does not exceed 12 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value from 3 through 5; and moist chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, silt, fine sandy loam, or loam.  In some pedons, this horizon has strata of organic material, but the average organic matter content does not exceed 12 percent.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent with 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures include loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.  Mottles with moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR are common in this horizon.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble. Tonguing and interfingering of the upper horizons is common."
