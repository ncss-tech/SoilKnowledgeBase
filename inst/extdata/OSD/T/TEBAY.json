  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the fibrous organic mat ranges from 2 to 5 inches.  Solum thickness ranges from 3 to 8 inches. Texture of the control section includes fine sandy loam, loam, and sandy loam.  There is less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral in the solum and neutral or slightly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3, and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is mucky silt loam, silt loam or silt.  In some pedons, this horizon has patches and strata of organic material, but the average organic matter content does not exceed 12 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value from 3 through 5; and moist chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, silt, fine sandy loam, or loam.  In some pedons, this horizon has strata of organic material, but the average organic matter content does not exceed 12 percent.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent with 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures include loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.  Mottles with moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR are common in this horizon.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble. Tonguing and interfingering of the upper horizons is common."

Tebay soils are on drumlins, moraines, and undulating till plains.  Slopes are convex and range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches, and the mean annual snowfall ranges from 39 to 68 inches. Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."

Pippin soils are gravelly, somewhat excessively drained and occur as localized outwash deposits within glacial till plains.  Tolsona soils are shallow to permafrost, poorly drained, and are on till plains and in depressions between moraines."
