    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  The Btg horizon has a gray matrix with mottles in shades of red, yellowish red or brown.  The Bt and Btg horizons are sandy clay or clay.\nSome pedons have BC or C horizons 4 to 10 inches thick with similar colors and texture as the Btg horizon.\nThe Cr horizon consists of thick layers of sandstone that can be cut with a spade in fresh cuts."

Arundel soils are well drained and montmorillonitic.  Annemaine, Beason, Craven, Creedmoor, Dogue, Eulonia, Gritney, Helena, Lignum, Nemour, Nevarc, Knewco, Peacock, Sacral, Stapp, and Wolftever soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick.  Cid soils have rock fragments of fine grained metamorphic rocks.   Rosenwall soils have more than 60 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Vinita soils have more silty textures.  Gilead and Hornsville soils have kaolinitic mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Telfair soils are on ridgetops and hillsides in dissected uplands of the Coastal Plain.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 15 percent. The soils formed in marine deposits of acid clays overlying horizontally bedded sandstone of the Hawthorn formation. The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 46 inches."

Ailey, Nankin, Susquehanna and Wicksburg soils have a thicker Bt horizon.  Ailey, Nankin and Wicksburg are better drained and occur on broader, smoother slopes."
