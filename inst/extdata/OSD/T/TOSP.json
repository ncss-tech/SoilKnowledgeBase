Gardner's Fork soils have silt loam and loam textures and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control sections.  Hailman soils have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control sections and have a paralithic contact at 100 to 150 cm.   Moonlight soils have cambic horizons and dominantly silt loam particle-size control sections.

Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 3,055 meters.  The climate is cold, continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm that comes largely from winter snowfall.  Mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C and the frost-free season ranges from 50 to 75 days."
