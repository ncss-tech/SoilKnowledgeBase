  "STATES": "IL,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Twomile series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loess or loess and  alluvium.  These soils are on high flood plains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

Depth to the 2B or 2C horizon is greater than 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 and mottles of higher or lower chroma and value.  It is silt loam or silt containing 10 to 18 percent clay and ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.  The Egx horizon has weak to moderately expressed fragipan-like brittleness when moist.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 with mottles of higher or lower value and chroma.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.  The BCg or 2BCg horizon is similar to the Btg horizon in color and texture and very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Cg or 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.   Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The high silt content and density of the E horizon make this soil more dry than texture would indicate.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 33 inches (Ap, E1, E2 and Egx horizons); albic horizon - the zone from approximately 9 to 33 inches (E1, E2 and Egx horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 33 to 52 inches (Btg horizon); an abrupt textural change is present between the Egx and Btg horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
