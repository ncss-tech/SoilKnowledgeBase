  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Thatcher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that have moderately slow permeability.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and lake sediments mainly from sandstone and conglomerate composed of sandstone, quartzite, and limestone.  They occur on foothill slopes, hills, terraces, and alluvial fans that have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",
