The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.\nThickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches and depth to the argillic horizon is 8 to 19 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 16 to 44 inches.  The particle size control section contains 5 to 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 1 to 3 moist. Gravel content range from 0 to 20 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline, and noneffervescent to slightly effervescent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 6 dry and moist.  It is commonly silty clay loam, silt loam, and less commonly clay loam with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Clay content ranges 25 to 35 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6 dry, 3 to 8 moist.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  Clay content ranges 25 to 35 percent.  Total rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, containing 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 8 moist and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is commonly stratified loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, gravelly loam or very gravelly loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 50 percent, dominantly gravel.  Cobble ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.
