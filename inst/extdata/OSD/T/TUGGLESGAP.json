  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Tugglesgap soils were previously mapped as Dillard and soils. Dillard soils have fewer rock fragments and a seasonal high water table at a depth of 2 to 3 feet. Tugglesgap soils are seasonally wet from November to April. The average depth to the top of the wet zone is thought to be less than 50 centimeters (20 inches); however, soil morphology does not meet the criteria for an aquic great group (Endoaquults). At present, reaction to alpha,alpha-dipyridyl reaction has not been tested. It is anticipated Tugglesgap soils may be reclassified to Aeric Endoaquults once additional data has been collected.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 35 inches (Bt and Btg horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the Argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year.\nLithologic discontinuity--Contrasting fragment content and hardness starting at a depth of 50 inches (2C horizon)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S99VA141013. Additional reference sample is S99VA141014.\nData Map Unit ID: 481505\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
