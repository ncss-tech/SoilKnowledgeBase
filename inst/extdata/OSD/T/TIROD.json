  "OVERVIEW": "The Tirod series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from quartzite and lake sediments.  They are on terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Tirod soils have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
