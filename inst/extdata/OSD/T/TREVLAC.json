The size of the coarse fragments is dominantly less than 3 inches but a few fragments range up to 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where present, the Ap has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very strongly acid to neutral.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid.  Coarse fragment content ranges form 0 to 10 percent.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value or 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6  and is silt loam or channery silt loam.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 35 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is very channery or extremely channery silt loam.  Coarse fragment content of the control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Croom, Elliber, Gainesboro, Hartleton, Irondale, Lew, Mertz, Pattenburg, and Weverton series in the same family and the Berks series.  All of these soils except Berks and Irondale are more than 40 inches to bedrock.  Berks soils do not have argillic horizons.  Croom soils have more sand in the Bt horizons.  Elliber soils formed in cherty residuum weathered from limestone.  Gainesboro soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the Bt horizon.  Hartleton soils formed in channery glacial till.  Irondale soils formed in gravelly and cobbly silty material and loamy residuum from granitic rock.  Lew soils formed in colluvium weathered from greenstone.  Mertz soils formed in loamy cherty colluvium or glacial material derived from limestone.  Pattenburg soils have hues of 2.5YR or redder."
