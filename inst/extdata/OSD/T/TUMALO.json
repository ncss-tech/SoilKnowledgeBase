The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to the indurated duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The pumice content (0.5 to 2.0 mm.) of the solum ranges from 20 to 60 percent. The solum contains 50 to 80 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, a phosphate retention of 25 to 60 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.6 percent and a 15-bar water content of 5 to 12 percent on both dried and undried samples.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The solum contains 5 to 10 percent clay and 55 to 75 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles and stones. Total rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam, and contains 15 to 40 percent gravel.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon is indurated throughout.  It is moderately alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon is extremely gravelly or very gravelly sand or coarse sand and contains 35 to 70 percent gravel."
