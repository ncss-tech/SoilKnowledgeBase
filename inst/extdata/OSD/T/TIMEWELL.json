The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 21 inches in thickness and includes the AE or E horizon in some pedons.  All horizons have base saturation greater than 50 percent.  Free carbonates are not present within a depth of 60 inches.  The series control section has sand content less than 8 percent and rock fragment content less than 1 percent.  The particle- size control section averages between 35 and 42 percent  clay.\nThe upper part of the control section (Ap, A, E, or AE horizons) has clay content of 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Individual horizons have properties as follows:\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam.\nThe E or AE horizon ranges from distinct to incipient. It has value of 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Clay depletions have value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have faint redoximorphic iron and manganese accumulations with value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.\nThe middle part of the control section (B horizon) has average clay content of 35 to 38 percent.  Individual subhorizons have between 25 and 45 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid in the upper horizons to neutral in the lower horizons.  Other properties by horizon are as follows:\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Hue of 5Y, if present, is in the lower part.  Redoximorphic iron and manganese accumulations and depletions have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay in the upper part, and silty clay loam or silt loam in the lower part.\nThe lower part of the control section (C horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 6.  Redoximorphic iron and manganese accumulations and depletions have colors similar to the range described in the B horizon.  It is silt loam or, less commonly, silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

Biddle soils have 5 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the subsoil.  Chase and Martin soils have mollic epipedons greater than 24 inches thick.  Greenton and Rutland soils average more than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the control section.  Grundy, Seymour, and Wymore soils average more than 42 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Ipava and Mahaska soils do not have an AE or E horizon or a moist color value more than 3 in the upper part of the control section.

Clarksdale soils have a thinner dark surface soil, and are closer to dissecting drainageways.  Ipava soils are on similar landform positions, and do not have an E horizon.  Osco and Newvienna soils average less clay in the particle-size control section, are moderately well drained, and are on similar and more sloping landform positions.  Rubio and Virden soils are poorly drained, and on slightly lower to depressional landform positions.  In addition, Rubio soils have a thinner dark surface soil, and Virden soils do not have an E horizon."
