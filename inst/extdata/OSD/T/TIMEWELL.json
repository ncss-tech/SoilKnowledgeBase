Free carbonates are not present within a depth of 60 inches.  The series control section has sand content less than 8 percent and rock fragment content less than 1 percent.  The particle- size control section averages between 35 and 42 percent  clay.\nThe upper part of the control section (Ap, A, E, or AE horizons) has clay content of 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Individual horizons have properties as follows:\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam.\nThe E or AE horizon ranges from distinct to incipient. It has value of 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Clay depletions have value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have faint redoximorphic iron and manganese accumulations with value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.\nThe middle part of the control section (B horizon) has average clay content of 35 to 38 percent.  Individual subhorizons have between 25 and 45 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid in the upper horizons to neutral in the lower horizons.  Other properties by horizon are as follows:\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Hue of 5Y, if present, is in the lower part.  Redoximorphic iron and manganese accumulations and depletions have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.

Redoximorphic iron and manganese accumulations and depletions have colors similar to the range described in the B horizon.  It is silt loam or, less commonly, silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral."
