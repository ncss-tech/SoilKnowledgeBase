    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to weathered redbed claystone ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 40 to 55 percent.  During most years cracks 1/4 to 3/4 inch wide extend to a depth greater than 20 inches.  Depth to wedge-shaped peds ranges from 24 to 35 inches.  Linear extensibility ranges from 6.0 to 6.5 cm in the upper 40 inches of the soil.\nThe A horizon has color with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Moist color value is 3 or 4.  Surface layers with mollic color average less than 7 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and is non-effervescent to strongly effervescent.\nThe Bw horizon has color with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4.  Texture is clay loam, clay or silty clay.  Very fine or fine concretions of calcium carbonate range from very few to common.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and is non-effervescent to strongly effervescent.\nThe Bk1 and Bk2 horizons have color with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Wedge-shaped aggregates are common below a depth of 26 to 35 inches.  Fine and medium concretions and masses of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  Crystals of gypsum range from none to common in the Bk2 horizon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.\nWhere present, the BCk horizon has color with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or silty clay.  Mottles and stains in shades of gray and olive are common.  These colors are inherited from the parent material.  Concretions and masses of calcium carbonate and crystals of gypsum range from 5 to 15 percent.  Weathered redbed claystone fragments are common in the lower part of the horizon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and is strongly effervescent to violently effervescent.\nThe Cd layer has color with hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Gray, light gray, greenish gray and olive gray mottles and strata are common.  It is redbed claystone stratified with clay, silty clay, or clay of the Permian age.  Some pedons contain thin strata of gypsum or broken dolomitic limestone.  Wedge shaped aggregates are common in some pedons.  Masses and coatings of calcium carbonate range from none to common.  Crystals of gypsum range from few to many.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and is non-effervescent to strongly effervescent."

Aspermont soils are on the same position as Tilvern soils and have fine-silty particle size control sections.  Cottonwood, Knoco and Talpa soils are on higher positions and are underlain by bedrock at shallow or very shallow depths.  Jaywi and Quanah soils are on stream terrace deposits or colluvial fans and have fine-silty particle size control sections. Westill soils are on higher positions mantled with Quaternary age deposits.  Also, Westill soils have a mollic epipedon and a argillic horizon.  Vernon soils are on more sloping positions than Tilvern soils."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with the Tillman and the Vernon series.  Some data indicate these soils may classify as Vertisols.  More study across the series province in the soil survey update will verify the classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized with this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 5 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - 5 to 53 inches (Bw, Bk, and BCk horizons).\nVertic features - Wedged shaped aggregates from 28 to 46 inches and cracks that open and close periodically.  Local COLE data indicates a linear extensibility of slightly more than 6.0 cm within a depth 100 cm (Bk2 horizon).\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is based on lab data from King County, TX, and Jackson County, OK.\nRange Site:  Clay Prairie - 078BY090TX."
