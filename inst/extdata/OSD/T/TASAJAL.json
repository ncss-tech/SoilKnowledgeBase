  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the petrocalcic horizon ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Secondary calcium carbonates occur below a depth of 20 inches.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 2 dS/m in the A horizon and ranges to as much as 6 dS/m in the 2B horizons.  One or more lithologic discontinuties occur in most pedons.\nThe A horizons has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  A few brownish concentrations occur in some pedons.  Exchangeable sodium in the upper 16 inches is more than 15 percent and increases with depth.  Reaction is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Btkn horizon has hue of 10YR value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  A few brownish concentrations occur 1n some pedons.  Calcium carbonate concretions and masses range from few to common.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 3Bk horizon is strongly cemented or indurated in the upper part and becomes less cemented with increasing depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Similar soils are Quiteria, Sauz and Willamar series.  These soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  Quiteria soils have low chroma depletions due to wetness within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Sauz and Willamar soils have an aquic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tasajal soils have plane slopes with gradients of 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in sandy eolian sediments (sand sheet) overlying loamy sediments of Pleistocene or Pliocene age, mainly of the Goliad Formation.  Climate is semiarid with mean annual precipitation ranging from 22 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature range is 73 to 74 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 26 to 30."

Nueces soils have a sandy epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Sarita soils have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick.  In addition, the Nueces and Sarita soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium."
