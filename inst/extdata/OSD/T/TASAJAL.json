  "OVERVIEW": "The Tasajal series consists of moderately deep to deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial and sandy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on gently sloping sandy eolian plains associated with the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 73 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 2 dS/m in the A horizon and ranges to as much as 6 dS/m in the 2B horizons.  One or more lithologic discontinuties occur in most pedons.\nThe A horizons has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  A few brownish concentrations occur in some pedons.  Exchangeable sodium in the upper 16 inches is more than 15 percent and increases with depth.  Reaction is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Btkn horizon has hue of 10YR value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  A few brownish concentrations occur 1n some pedons.  Calcium carbonate concretions and masses range from few to common.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 3Bk horizon is strongly cemented or indurated in the upper part and becomes less cemented with increasing depth."
