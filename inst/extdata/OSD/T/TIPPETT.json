  "OVERVIEW": "The Tippett series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over clayey alluvium or lacustrine deposits.  Tippett soils are in large depressions or drainageways on plateaus and structural benches.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 days during the summer in most years.  The particle size control section has 40 to 55 percent clay.  There is an absolute clay increase of 15 to 20 percent between the 2E and 3Bt horizons.  Cracks are 5 mm or more wide in most years and slickensides are present in the 3Btkss horizon.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and includes all or part of the Bw horizon.  Depth to albic materials is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the clayey argillic horizon is 15 to 25 inches.  Depth to slickensides and lime accumulation is 20 to 35 inches.   The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline above the clay and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline within the clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry.  The structure is granular or subangular blocky.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron is 0.3 to 1.0 percent and volcanic glass is 10 to 20 percent.  It is ashy silty clay loam with 27 to 30 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2E horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has texture of silt loam or loam with 20 to 25 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel and appear as a stone line.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  The soil texture is clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  The soil structure is prismatic or angular blocky.\nThe 3Btkss horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  The soil structure is prismatic or angular blocky.  Segregated lime is absent in some pedons.  The percentage of clay ranges from 45 to 55.  It has 0 to 10 percent CaCO3 equivalent.\nThe 3BCk horizon has colors similar to the 3Btkss horizon.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel.  The 3BCk horizon may be absent in some pedons."
