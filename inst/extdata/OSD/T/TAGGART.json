In drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part."
