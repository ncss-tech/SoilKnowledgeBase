  "STATES": "IN,OH,WV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Taggart series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess or silty sediments and in the underlying loamy outwash. The Taggart soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
