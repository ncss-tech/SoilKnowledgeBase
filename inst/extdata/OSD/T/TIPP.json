Kobel soils are in a fine particle-size class, do not have a mollic epipedon and are poorly drained.  Taylorbay soils are in a fine-silty particle-size class and are well drained.  Yancopin soils are in a fine-silty particle-size class, do not have a mollic epipedon and are somewhat poorly drained."

Unprotected areas of these soils flood for brief to very long periods mostly during the winter and early spring.  These soils typically have an apparent seasonal water table at 4 to 6 feet below the soil surface for brief periods in the winter an early spring."
