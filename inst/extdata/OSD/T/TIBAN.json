  "OVERVIEW": "The Tiban series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, till or slide deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on escarpments, mountain slopes, hills, ridges, alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan remnants and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
