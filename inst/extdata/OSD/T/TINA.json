    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The upper part of the solum to a depth of 40 inches or more contains less than 15 percent sand, most of which is very fine sand.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 15 to 30 inches and extends into the Bt horizon.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon commonly is black (10YR 2/1) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1), but some pedons are very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2).  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have BA horizons.\nThe Bt horizon commonly is very dark gray (10YR 3/1) or black (10YR 2/1), but some pedons are very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2).  It is silty clay loam or silty clay containing 35 to 48 percent clay.\nThe Btg horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 or less and is mottled.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 48 percent clay.\nThe 2BCg horizon and the 2Cg horizon have a hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 6.  They are very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, and clay loam and contain 20 percent or more sand."

Adair, Malvern and Mayberry soils have color of 7.5YR or 5YR in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Arispe, Grundy, Herrick, Ipava, Herrick, Macksburg, Mahaska, Seymour and Wymore soils have less than 15 percent sand throughout.  Chase soils have a mollic epipedon more than 36 inches thick.  Flanagan, Pawnee, Rutlan and Shorewood soils have carbonates in the lower part of the profile.  Greenton and Martin soils have more clay in the lower part of the profile.  Lagonda soils a have marked sand increase at depths less than 40 inches.  Lamoni soils have more than 15 percent sand above depths of 40 inches."

The Cotter and Norborne soils are on similar landscapes.  The Aholt, Booker, Dockery, Colo, Portage and Vesser soils occur on lower positions than the Tina soils.  Zook and Wabash soils are slightly lower on the landscape or occur in depressional areas on similar landscapes."
