The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 15 to 30 inches and extends into the Bt horizon.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon commonly is black (10YR 2/1) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1), but some pedons are very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2).  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have BA horizons.\nThe Bt horizon commonly is very dark gray (10YR 3/1) or black (10YR 2/1), but some pedons are very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2).  It is silty clay loam or silty clay containing 35 to 48 percent clay.\nThe Btg horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 or less and is mottled.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 48 percent clay.\nThe 2BCg horizon and the 2Cg horizon have a hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 6.  They are very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, and clay loam and contain 20 percent or more sand."

Flanagan, Pawnee, Rutlan and Shorewood soils have carbonates in the lower part of the profile.  Greenton and Martin soils have more clay in the lower part of the profile.  Lagonda soils a have marked sand increase at depths less than 40 inches.  Lamoni soils have more than 15 percent sand above depths of 40 inches."
