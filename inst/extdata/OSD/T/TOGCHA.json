Argillic horizon - 5 to 28 inches.\nHapl great group - C1 and C3 horizons are sand-and gravel-sized saprolitic flecks that crush or rub to clay texture. Do not meet intent of Pale great group as these are not pedogenic clays, but rather saprolitic layers. More study needed to determine if this is a paralithic content.\nWould be a Ultic Vertic Haplustalf if the subgroup were recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterized by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (sample #S83-GU-066-014).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 10th edition 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
