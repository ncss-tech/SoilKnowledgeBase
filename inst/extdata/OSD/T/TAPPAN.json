  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar series include the Barry, Brookston, Kilmanagh, Parkhill, and Pell Creek series. None of these soils have carbonates within 25 cm of the soil surface. Barry and Brookston soils do not have densic materials within the series control section and have argillic horizons. Kilmanagh and Parkhill soils have an ochric epipedon. Pell Creek soils do not have densic material within the series control section."

Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 720 to 960 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 135 to 210 days."

The somewhat poorly drained Avoca and Poseyville soils are on low knolls and have sandy materials in the upper part of the subsoil. The poorly drained Corunna soils are on similar landform positions and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section."
