These soils do not have a water table above a depth of 6 feet for 30 consecutive days.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (A1 and A2 horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 25 to 66 cm (10 to 26 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
