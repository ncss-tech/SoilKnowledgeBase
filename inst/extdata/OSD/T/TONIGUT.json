  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonigut series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Tonigut soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 40 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
