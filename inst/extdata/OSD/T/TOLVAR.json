  "OVERVIEW": "The Tolvar series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks and slope alluvium over colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist. Tolvar soils are on moderately to steeply sloping mountain slopes, toeslopes, footslopes, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 3 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and means annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
