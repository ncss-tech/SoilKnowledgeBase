  "OVERVIEW": "The Tress series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in calcareous glacial till on uplands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 56 centimeters (22 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C (43 degrees F).",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 41 to 61 centimeters (16 to 24 inches).

It typically is clay loam, but the range includes loam. It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. Peds in the Bt horizon have few or common faint clay films.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. They are clay loam or loam. They are moderately alkaline and contain both diffuse and segregated carbonates. There are common to many redox features above a depth of 76 centimeters (30 inches).\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is clay loam or loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. There are common to many redox features."
