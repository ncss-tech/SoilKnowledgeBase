Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 41 to 61 centimeters (16 to 24 inches). Rock fragments range from 1 to 8 percent throughout, mostly pebble in size.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1or 2. It typically is clay loam, but the range includes loam. It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. Peds in the Bt horizon have few or common faint clay films.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. They are clay loam or loam. They are moderately alkaline and contain both diffuse and segregated carbonates. There are common to many redox features above a depth of 76 centimeters (30 inches).\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is clay loam or loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. There are common to many redox features."
