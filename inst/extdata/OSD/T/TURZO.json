  "OVERVIEW": "The Turzo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite rocks.  Turzo soils are on alluvial fans, fan terraces, stream terraces, and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
