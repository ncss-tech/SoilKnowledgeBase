    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tocito soils are on low stream terraces and fan terraces of probable early Holocene age.  Tocito soils formed in stratified alluvium derived from Cretaceous siltstone and shale. Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Gyptur soils have gypsic horizons and are strongly saline-sodic. Littlehat soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock and occur on adjacent uplands. Notal soils are fine textured. Persayo soils are shallow to soft bedrock on adjacent uplands."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 6 inches.  (Ap horizon)\nEntisol feature - the lack of diagnostic subsurface horizons.  This soil contains segregated gypsum in the BCy and C horizons, but does not contain segregated calcium carbonate. The soil is stratified, but does not demonstrate irregular organic carbon distribution.  This soil seldom floods but has the potential to flood in unusual storms.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Salinity values were determined on four pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge. In addition, percent gypsum, electrical conductivity, and particle-size were determined on the typifying pedon through reference samples by the BIA soils laboratory in Gallup, NM.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
