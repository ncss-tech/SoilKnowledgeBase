  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tekoa soils are on mountain slopes and hills at elevation of 2,000 to 4,000 feet. At higher elevations these soils only occur on south slopes. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. These soils formed in loess and colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks including shale, phyllite, argillite, sandstone, quartzite, and siltstone with an influence of volcanic ash in surface layers. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches including about 3 feet of snow. Average January temperature is 24 degrees F, average July temperature is 66 degrees F, and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 140 days."

Schumacher soils are on west-facing hills, are fine-loamy, and deep to bedrock. Libertybutte soils are on south and west-facing shoulders and summits of mountains and hills, and are shallow to bedrock. Ardenvoir and McCrosket soils are on north and east-facing backslopes of mountains and hills, are loamy-skeletal and are deep to bedrock."
