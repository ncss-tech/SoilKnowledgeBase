  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Breakneck, Burton, Cataloochee, Guyot, Oconaluftee, and Wayah series. All of these soils formed in residuum. Breakneck and Burton soils have a lithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches. Cataloochee soils have a paralithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches. Guyot soils have a paralithic contact within depths of 40 to 60 inches. Oconaluftee, and Wayah soils are very deep.  Breakneck, Cataloochee, Guyot, and Oconaluftee soils formed from low-grade metasedimentary rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tanasee soils are on gently sloping to very steep toe slopes, benches, and fans in coves at high elevations in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Slope ranges from 2 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from about 4300 to 6600 feet. These soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered from felsic to mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks such as mica gneiss, hornblende gneiss, granite, schist, and high-grade metagraywacke. Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 60 to 110 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days, and length of the growing season is about three months. Moist atmosphericconditions in the form of fog and cloud cover are prevalent throughout the year in these high mountain areas."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Burton and Wayah series, these are the Balsam, Clingman, Craggey, and Longhope series. Balsam soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Clingman and Craggey soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches. Longhope soils are very poorly drained and have organic horizons 16 to 30 inches thick overlying mineral soil material. Balsam soils occur on landscapes similar to Tanasee soils. Burton, Clingman, Craggey, and Wayah soils are on adjacent ridges and side slopes. Longhope soils occur in broad drainageways or fens (locally referred to as \"bogs\")."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is in State or Federal ownership and is used for watershed protection, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Most of this soil is forested. In areas higher than about 5,400 feet, red spruce and fraser fir are the dominant trees. At the lower elevations, northern red oak, black oak, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, yellow buckeye, and white ash are common trees. In many areas, the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept\" phase is recognized. Common understory plants are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, silverbell, pin cherry, rhododendron, flame azalea, blueberry, blackberry, hay-scented fern, trillium, woodfern, New York fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, and raspberry. A small acreage is used for native pasture and Christmas tree production."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Tanasee series was formerly included with the Tusquitee series. However, Tusquitee soils are in a mesic family.\nThe 1/97 revision placed Tanasee soils in a fine-loamy particle-size class. This series was formerly placed in a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Laboratory PSA (pipette method) and corresponding field texture estimates (feel method) indicate control section clay contents of generally 12 to 24 percent, with most pedons marginally coarse-loamy. Fine-loamy particle-size class placement is based on the presence of amorphous (non-crystalline) clay-size material associated with the relatively high organic matter content found in these soils. Although field estimates, laboratory measurements, and calculated values may vary, clay content in the particle-size control section is generally less than 25 percent. Although Tanasee soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\nThe following diagnostic horizons and features are recognized in the typical pedon:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 14 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 14 to 32 inches below the surface (Bw horizon)\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nRevised  02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nMLRA = 130B SIR's = NC0198, NC0197 (STONY)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
