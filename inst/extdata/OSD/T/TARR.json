  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth in the following paragraph are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The weighted average content of silt plus clay is 5 percent or less in the particle-size control section but is more than 5 percent in the upper 10 to 20 inches of the series control section.  The sand fraction is more than 90 percent quartz or other non-weatherable minerals.  Volume of sandstone channers and chert fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 1 or 2.  The O horizon is a mat of moderately decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4..\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  It is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 5 to 8; and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand.  In some pedons formed in residuum, there are strata of redder hue inherited from the parent material."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boone, Carver, Hookson, and Tint series.  Boone soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 and 40 inches. Carver soils have 25 percent or more of coarse and very coarse sand and less than 50 percent of either medium, fine or very fine sand.  Hookson soils (MAP=44) inches are more moist in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice and they have 5 percent or less of silt plus clay throughout.  Tint soils have redox features and a seasonal high water table."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Tarr soils formed in siliceous sandy pedisediment over siliceous sandy residuum from sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1400 feet."

The excessively drained Boone soils are nearby on uplands where sandstone bedrock is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. The excessively drained and moderately well drained Impact soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Tarr soils where there is a thick dark colored surface layer.  The moderately well drained Tint soils and the somewhat poorly drained Majik soils form a drainage sequence with Tarr soils.  The moderately well drained Tintson soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Tarr soils where there is a loamy substratum at 40 to 60 inches."
