These soils formed in calcareous alluvium derived from tuff with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and semi-arid.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is l00 to l20 days."

Cherry Spring soils have a natric horizon and a strongly cemented duripan at a depth between 50 and 100 cm.  Orovada soils lack a calcic horizon.  Puett soils are shallow to weathered tuff bedrock.  Tenabo soils are shallow to an indurated duripan."
