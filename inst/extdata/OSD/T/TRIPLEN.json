  "OVERVIEW": "The Triplen series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from tuff and loess high in volcanic ash.  The Triplen soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 4 to l5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
