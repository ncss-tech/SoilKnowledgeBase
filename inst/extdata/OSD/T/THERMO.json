  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Diagnostic remnants of argillic\nhorizons from premined soils range from 3 to about 15 percent by volume and from fine to very coarse in size.  These are randomly oriented.  Horizontal layers resulting from scraper placement range from about 7 to 20 inches in thickness and may be widely contrasting in properties.  Textures are mixed within horizons and vary among horizons.  Composite texture throughout is primarily clay loam, sandy clay or clay, but ranges from sandy loam to clay in layers, pockets and lenses.  Unoxidized overburden randomly occurs in layers or mixed with oxidized material.  Colors range in shades of brown, gray, red or yellow.  Reaction before liming mainly from medium acid through slightly acid, but ranges from strongly acid through neutral in some horizons.  Fragments of randomly oriented lignite are common.  These soils are mostly sticky and plastic when wet and hard or very hard when dry.  Most have a dense compact layer, denser than above layers, at depths of 24 to 40 inches.  These layers inhibit root development and moisture penetration.  This is particularly noticeable after rain, as lower layers remain dry and hard in contrast to moist layers above.  They appear to be compacted by scraper traffic."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The proposed Diswood is in the same family but has less contrasting and fewer layers, apparently due to dragline versus scraper placement, and has less dense layers at lower depths.  The proposed Distell series differs in the same manner and is dry for longer periods of time during the year; also, Distell soils are in a fine-loamy family."

They consist dominantly of oxidized materials.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 63 to 68 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 44 inches.  P-E indices range from 64 to 72."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Most minesoils are placed in Orthents.  Because they contain remnants of diagnostic horizons, these soils classify in Arents.\nComposite textures refer to horizon samples that have been mixed for laboratory analyses.  All pH values are 1:1 water on composite samples.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 11 inches.\nFragments of diagnostic horizon - 11 to 60 inches, fragments make up about 3 to 15 percent by volume.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
