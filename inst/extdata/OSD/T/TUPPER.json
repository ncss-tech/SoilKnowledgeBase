  "OVERVIEW": "The Tupper series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from Lake Bonneville flood sediments.  Tupper soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
