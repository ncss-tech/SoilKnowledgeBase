Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is about 15 to 30 inches. The average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Nevine soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 14 to 30 inches thick and are on moraines, foothills and mountains. Scrabblers soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick and are on similar landscapes as Torboy soils. Stapaloop soils are coarse-loamy. Wapal soils are sandy-skeletal. Scrabblers and Wapal soils are on similar landscapes as Torboy soils."

St. Helens 'T' or 'W' volcanic ash, a cambic horizon from 1.25 to 18 inches.\nThough the coarse-loamy B extends to 17 inches, it averages more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand and does not meet contrasting particle-size criteria.\nThe 2005 description reflected a change in classification due to revisions in soil taxonomy from sandy, mixed, frigid Vitrandic Xerochrepts to sandy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
