They formed in colluvium overlying residuum from sandstone, siltstone or igneous rock.  Elevations are 50 to 1,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers.   Many summer days have fog or low cloud cover during the mornings.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 145 to 245 days."
