Mollic colors ranges to a maximum depth of 15 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon may include the E and Bt horizons.  The depth to carbonates is 25 to greater than 60 inches and is associated with the depth to till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1.  It typically is fine sandy loam but is loam or sandy loam in some pedons.  It has few to common, faint or distinct redox features in some pedons.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  The E horizon extends into the Bt horizon in some profiles and bleached sand and silt grains coat faces of peds in the Bt horizon.  Redox features range from few to many and faint to prominent.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam and the percent clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Few or common, faint or distinct redox features are in most pedons. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Redox features range from common to many and faint to prominent.  Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon.  Some pedons do not have a C horizon above the 2C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Redox features range from common to many and faint to prominent."

In addition the Blendon, Carthage and Henkin soils are coarse-loamy and the Forestburg soils are sandy over loamy.  The somewhat poorly drained Elsmere soils are in nearby swales and are sandy.  Lawet soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches and are at edges of the depressions.  The poorly drained Overshue and Shue soils are in shallow and commonly smaller depressions and do not have an albic horizon.  In addition, the Overshue soils are coarse-loamy and the Shue soils are sandy over loamy."
