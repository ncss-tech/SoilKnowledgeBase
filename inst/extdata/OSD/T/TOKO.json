In addition the Blendon, Carthage and Henkin soils are coarse-loamy and the Forestburg soils are sandy over loamy.  The somewhat poorly drained Elsmere soils are in nearby swales and are sandy.  Lawet soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches and are at edges of the depressions.  The poorly drained Overshue and Shue soils are in shallow and commonly smaller depressions and do not have an albic horizon.  In addition, the Overshue soils are coarse-loamy and the Shue soils are sandy over loamy."
