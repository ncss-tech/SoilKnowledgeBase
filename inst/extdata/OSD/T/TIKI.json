  "OVERVIEW": "The Tiki series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from limestone. Tiki soils are on foothill sideslopes and cliffs and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
