  "OVERVIEW": "The Tecumseh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till. The Tecumseh soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

They are on lower lying portions of the till plains which are typically near outwash plains or stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till. The till contains strata of coarser material in many places. Sandy and gravelly textures are within a depth of 2.4 to 3.6 meters (8 to 12 feet) in many places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 11 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F).\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Lauramie and Mellott soils. Lauramie soils have more sand in the upper part of the sola and are on more sloping areas in the landform. Mellott soils are on similar landform positions but have dark colored surface layers less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick.\nDRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.\nUSE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, or small grain. A few areas are used for hay or pasture. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, chiefly big bluestem.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Indiana; MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent.\nSOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: Tippecanoe County, Indiana, 1993.\nREMARKS: Differentiae separating Tecumseh series and Sidell series are unclear based on current series concepts. The 6/87 revision of Sidell Official Series Description indicates that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till, same as Tecumseh series. Historical records indicate that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying till, and it is believed that this is the correct series concept. This will need to be investigated and resolved during MLRA updating activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 165 cm (Bt, 2Bt, 3Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
