The series is of small extent.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana.\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: Tippecanoe County, Indiana, 1993.\nREMARKS: Differentiae separating Tecumseh series and Sidell series are unclear based on current series concepts. The 6/87 revision of Sidell Official Series Description indicates that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till, same as Tecumseh series. Historical records indicate that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying till, and it is believed that this is the correct series concept. This will need to be investigated and resolved during MLRA updating activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 165 cm (Bt, 2Bt, 3Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
