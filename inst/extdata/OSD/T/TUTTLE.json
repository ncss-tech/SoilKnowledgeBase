  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuttle series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in colluvium deposited over residuum from calcareous shales and limestone.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

This soil generally contains free carbonates to the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (dry or moist), and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is channery silty clay loam but includes silty clay loam, clay loam, and channery clay loam.  This horizon is dominately moderately alkaline, but some pedons are mildly alkaline or neutral.  Limestone fragments less than 6 inches in length range from 0 to 30 percent by volume.  Coarse limestone fragments greater than 6 inches in length range from 5 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is channery silty clay loam but includes silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, channery silty clay and channery clay loam.  Limestone fragments less than 6 inches in length range from 0 to 40 percent by volume.  Coarse limestone fragments greater than 6 inches in length range from 0 to 35 percent by volume.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is channery silty clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay and channery silty clay.  Shale and weathered limestone fragments range from 0 to 30 percent by volume.  Some pedons have mottles."
