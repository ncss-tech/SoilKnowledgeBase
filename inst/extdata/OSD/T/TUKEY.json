  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have no E horizon and have a dark colored A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 , 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 2 to 4 dry.  Texture below 10 inches is very gravelly loam, or very gravelly clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5 Y or 10YR value of 4 to 6, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  This horizon is mottled.  Texture is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bsm horizon is weakly cemented glacial till."

These soils are in a mild marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is 56 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season is about 250 days."

Cassolary soils are deep and coarse-loamy.  Clallam soils are less than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are not cemented in the lower part.  Dick soils are deep and sandy throughout.  Hoypus soils are deep and sandy- skeletal."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  No new data is available. No Tukey soils are correlated in Clallam County Washington.  The pan in Tukey soils could be ortstein rather than a duripan.  Laboratory data on similar soils shows the cementing agents to be iron, aluminum and organic matter.  The series needs further study.  In addition, further investigatin is needed on the consecutive days dry for this soil.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from 3 to 5 inches, a cambic horizon from 1 to 30 inches, and a cemented pan at 36 to 56 inches.\nClassification changed 1/00 from mixed, mesic Vitrandic Durochrepts to isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
