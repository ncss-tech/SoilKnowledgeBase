  "OVERVIEW": "The Tyrone soils consist of deep, well drained soils formed in thick, limy, silty materials weathered from marl, limestone, and very limy earth of the Niobrara or similar formation.  These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is 36 centimeters (14 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C. (46 degrees F.) at the type location.",
