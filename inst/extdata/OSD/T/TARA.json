Most of the correlated and published county subset taxonomic unit descriptions for the Tara series support the classification change to Aquic Pachic subgroup.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; User Pedon IDs 1978MN012-000 (2841) and 75MN023(1986).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
