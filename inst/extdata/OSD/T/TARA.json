  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tara series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of glaciolacustrine sediments or loess and in the underlying till of Late Wisconsin Age.  These soils are on glacial lake plains and moraines on till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 645 millimeters (about 25 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C (about 43 degrees F).",

Most of the correlated and published county subset taxonomic unit descriptions for the Tara series support the classification change to Aquic Pachic subgroup.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014."
