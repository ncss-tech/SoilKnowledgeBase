  "OVERVIEW": "The Tresed series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Tresed soils are on lake plains and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
