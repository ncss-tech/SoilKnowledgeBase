  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum commonly is 40 to 60 inches but is more than 60 inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is greater than 47 degrees F. The soil is usually moist and is dry between 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to mottles having chroma of 2 or less (redox depletions) is 10 to 20 inches.  The upper square meter of the mineral soil contains 12 to 18 kilograms of organic carbon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent gravel.  It has 4 to 8 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Btg horizon has matrix hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 1 through 4 dry.  It is clay, silty clay or clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Base saturation is 15 to 35 percent by sum of bases throughout.  It has 0.5 to 3.0 percent organic matter decreasing with depth."
