  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 66 to 74 degree F.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam and contains less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent rock fragments.  In some pedons, gravel is scattered throughout the profile.  Organic matter content is low or moderately low and decreases regularly with depth to less than 0.35 percent above depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  When mixed to depth of 7 inches, it is not both darker in value than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, both broken and rubbed.  It is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous and is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is massive or has weak subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately or slightly calcareous and moderately to strongly alkaline.  The Cca horizon has moderate or weak accumulation of carbonates, but contains less than 15 percent in any layer at least 6 inches thick, and it is not cemented."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Heistseries in the same family and the Lolalita, Mazuma and Oasis series.  Oasis soils have an organic matter content that decreases irregularly with depth.  Mazuma soils are dry more than 3/4 of the time the soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F.  Lolalita soils are noncalcareous to 2 feet or deeper.  Heist soils have a 7.5YR hue, chroma of 4 and a weakly cemented Cca horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are in alluvial fans and terraces and in alluvium on basalt plains at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are predominantly less than 7 percent and range from 0 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvium or eolian deposits.  The climate is middle latitude steppe (Trewartha's Modified Koppen system) and has dry summers.  The frost free period is 110 to 160 days, and mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches including 0.5 to 2 feet of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F."

Cencove soils have contrasting textures.  Feltham soils are dominantly loamy sand between depths of 10 and 40 inches.  Garbutt soils are coare silty.  Quincy soils are sandy.  Scism soils have silt loam texture throughout."
