  "OVERVIEW": "The Tulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The Tulch soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
