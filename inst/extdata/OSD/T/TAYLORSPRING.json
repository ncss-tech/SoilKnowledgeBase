  "OVERVIEW": "The Taylorspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. These soils are on fan remnants, hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
