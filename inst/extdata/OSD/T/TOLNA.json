  "OVERVIEW": "The Tolna series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy materials over sand and gravel outwash containing appreciable amounts of shale.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and rapid or very rapid in the sand and gravel material.  These soils are on glacial outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches.",

The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  The A and B horizons are medium acid or slightly acid and the 2C horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam averaging between 18 and 24 percent clay and 25 to 40 percent silt.  Mottles are few or common, faint to prominent, and commonly increase in abundance in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 and 4 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is stratified sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or coarse sand containing 5 to 40 percent gravel.  It contains more than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction."

All of these soils, except Ogdensburg, are less acid in the solum.  In addition, Firth and Hagensville soils do not have sand and gravel 2C horizons; Sundell soils are underlain by limestone bedrock; Binford soils are sandy and are well drained; Brantford soils do not have the transitional 2Bw3 horizon as much as 5 inches thick and are well drained; Walum soils are sandy; and Warsing soils contain less than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction of the 2C horizon.  Ogdensburg soils have sandstone bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches and occur in areas having more than 27 inches of precipitation."

Divide soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches.  Kensal soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
