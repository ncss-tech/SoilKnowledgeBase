  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to the 2C horizon typically is 24 to 30 inches, but ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  The A and B horizons are medium acid or slightly acid and the 2C horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam averaging between 18 and 24 percent clay and 25 to 40 percent silt.  Mottles are few or common, faint to prominent, and commonly increase in abundance in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 and 4 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is stratified sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or coarse sand containing 5 to 40 percent gravel.  It contains more than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Firth, Hagensville, Ogdensburg and Sundell series in the same family and the Binford, Brantford, Walum and Warsing series.  All of these soils, except Ogdensburg, are less acid in the solum.  In addition, Firth and Hagensville soils do not have sand and gravel 2C horizons; Sundell soils are underlain by limestone bedrock; Binford soils are sandy and are well drained; Brantford soils do not have the transitional 2Bw3 horizon as much as 5 inches thick and are well drained; Walum soils are sandy; and Warsing soils contain less than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction of the 2C horizon.  Ogdensburg soils have sandstone bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches and occur in areas having more than 27 inches of precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tolna soils are in depressions and shallow swales on glacial outwash plains.  Slope gradient is 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in loamy outwash materials overlying sand and gravel containing appreciable amounts of shale.  The climate is cool, subhumid, with a mean annual temperature ranging from 38 to 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 20 inches.  Most of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer."

All the associated soils are on outwash plains and commonly on slightly higher elevations in the landscape.  Binford, Kensal, Walum and Warsing soils are better drained than the Tolna soils.  Divide soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches.  Kensal soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

The seasonal water table is at a depth of less than 24 inches for only a short time when the soil is not frozen."
