  "OVERVIEW": "The Turquoise series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from granodiorite, granite, and quartzite. Turquoise soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 mm) and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F (15.6 degrees C).",
