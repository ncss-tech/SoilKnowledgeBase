  "OVERVIEW": "The Tabletop series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in calcareous eolian deposits over colluvium and/or residuum weathered from basalt and andesite. These soils are on lava flows. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 18 degrees C.",
