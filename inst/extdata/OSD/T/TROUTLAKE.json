These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt mixed with volcanic ash. Summers are cool and dry and winters are cool and wet with snow cover from December through April. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 55 inches. The mean January temperature is 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 80 to 90 days."
