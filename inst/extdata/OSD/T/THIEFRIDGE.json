Copenhaver and Nieman soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Donkehill soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Hogmalat soils have mean summer soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F.  Layview soils have lithic contacts that are within 14 inches of the soil surface.  Maygal soils have mean summer soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F., do not have Oi horizons, and have 1 to 3 percent organic matter in the A horizons.  Mosroc soils have mean summer soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F. and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Mountpatterson soils average 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, do not have Oi horizons, and have 2 to 4 percent organic matter in the A horizons.  Nielsen soils have mean summer soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F., are dominated by channers, and have rock fragments that are sandstone or quartzite.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Thiefridge soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOrganic soil material - The zone from the soil surface to 1 inch (Oi horizon).\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 1 to 17 inches (A1, A2, A3, and Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 12 to 17 inches (Bt horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 17 inches to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 12 to 17 inches (Bt horizon).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic Lithic Argicryolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
