The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 20 percent are cobbles and stones and 25 to 40 percent are gravel.  Rock fragments are mainly rhyolite.  It has 7 to 18 percent clay.  The very fine sand fraction contains 50 to 70 percent glass.  It is moderately to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 when moist and 5 or 6 when dry; and chroma of 2 to 4 when moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 when moist, and chroma of 4 or 5 when moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent of which 0 to 20 percent are cobbles and stones and 25 to 40 percent are gravel.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 6 when moist and 6 to 8 when dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 when moist and dry.  It is sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent of which 10 to 25 percent are cobbles and stones and 25 to 35 percent are gravel."
