  "OVERVIEW": "The Tabor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on stream terraces and terrace remnants along river valleys on Inland dissected coastal plains.  The  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F)",
