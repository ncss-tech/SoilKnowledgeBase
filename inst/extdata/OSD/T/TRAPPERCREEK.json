  "OVERVIEW": "The Trappercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources, dominated by loess, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. They are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent. Permeability is moderately slow. The mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
