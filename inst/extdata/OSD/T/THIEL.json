    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches. Gravel and cobbles increase with depth. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F. and average summer temperature ranges from 50 to 58 degrees F. The hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. Cobbles on the surface range from 0 to 20 percent. The Bt horizon contains 35 to 50 percent by volume of gravel and cobbles. The Bk horizon has an estimated 10 to 45 percent CaC03 equivalent. Pebbles and cobbles have lime crusts on undersides."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Thiel soils are on gravelly terrace edges, hills, fan remnants, and narrow ridges and valley floors at elevations ranging from 5,000 to 8,500 feet. The gravelly and cobbly alluvium contains large quantities of granite and gneiss rocks with some limestone and quartzite. The climate is cold subhumid with a mean annual temperature ranging from 40 to 47 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 10 to 19 inches, mean summer temperature is less than 59 degrees F. and mean winter temperature is 16 to 20 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Charlos, Hanson, Heath and Maurice soils. Charlos soils have a distinct thick B2t (argillic) horizon and gravelly substratum occurs below depths ranging from 25 to 36 inches. Hanson soils have a calcic horizon. Heath soils have a thicker solum and formed from sandstone and shale beds. Maurice soils have no B horizon and they occur on river flood plains and recent river terraces."
