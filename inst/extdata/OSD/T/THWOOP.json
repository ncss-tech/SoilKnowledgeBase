These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolite and shallow intrusive rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,555 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool semiarid, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
