Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 27 degrees F., average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

Potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, needleandthread and basin big sagebrush. Native vegetation for Tagear, bedrock substratum on mounds is comprised of three distinct plant communities. The north aspect of the mounds is Idaho fescue and threetip sagebrush. The tops of the mounds is basin wildrye and basin big sagebrush. The south aspect of the mounds is bluebunch wheatgrass and Wyoming big sagebrush."
