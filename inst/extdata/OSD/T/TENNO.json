  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenno series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum over basalt.  Tenno soils are on lava plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
