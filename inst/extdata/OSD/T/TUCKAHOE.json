  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Tuckahoe series are deep and well drained.  They\nformed in recent alluvium sediment on nearly level flood plains in the Piedmont and upper Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 40 to 65 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments, where present, are less than 5 percent by volume at depths of less than 40 inches.  Content of flakes of mica ranges from none to many.  A buried horizon is in some pedons in the lower part of the solum.  The soil ranges from strongly acid through neutral throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Mottles are in some pedons, but mottles with chroma of 2 or less are below 24 inches.  The B horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Sand content is less than 45 percent.\nThe C horizon is stratified, and is variable in color and texture."
