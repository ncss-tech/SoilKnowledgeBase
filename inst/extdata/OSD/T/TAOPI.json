  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to carbonates range from 20 to 40 inches.  The A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon range from medium acid to neutral and the 2B horizon is neutral or slightly acid.  Coarse fragments make up about 2 to 10 percent of the solum.  The 3C horizon which is a soft limestone or siltstone, contains 10 to 40 percent dominantly limestone coarse fragments ranging from pebbles to cobbles or channers that are in a fine earth consisting of silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  Hard limestone is at depths of 50 inches or more.\nThe A horizon is typically very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) but includes values of 2 and chroma of 1 through 3.  The texture of the A horizon is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 3 to 8 inches thick sandy loam, loam or silt loam E horizon that is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or brown (10YR 5/3).\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture is loam or clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam or clay.  In many pedons, a stone line is common in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe 3C horizon has a hue of 10YR, values of 6 or 7, and chromas of 1 through 6."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Taopi soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands with plane to convex slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of a loamy mantle and clayey residuum over channery or cobbly soft limestone or siltstone.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 33 inches."
