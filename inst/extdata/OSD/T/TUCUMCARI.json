Change in family classification from mixed to smectitic mineralogy is based on this data which shows these soils have more smectitic clays than any other single clay mineral.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm.  (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 20 to 114 cm.  (Bt horizon)\nVertic feature: LE of 6.0 cm or more between soil surface and a depth of 100 cm\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data from De Baca County, NM (S82NM-011-001)\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
