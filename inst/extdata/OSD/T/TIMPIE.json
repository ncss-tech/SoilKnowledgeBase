  "STATES": "NV,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Timpie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from limestone and quartzite on alluvial flats, dissected lake plains, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 69 to 72 degrees F.  The soil is dry more than 75 percent of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are moist for fewer than 10 days between July and October.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4, dry or moist.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 8 millimhos/cm.  Consistence is soft to hard, friable to very friable, slightly sticky to sticky, and slightly plastic to moderately plastic.\nThe Bw and C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4, dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.  Conductivity of the saturation extract is 4 to greater than 16 millimhos/cm.  Consistence of the B horizon is soft to slightly hard, slightly sticky to sticky, and slightly plastic to moderately plastic.  C horizon structure is massive or platy."

Blueagle soils have granular structure, include silty clay loam textures in the control section and are moist in some part for more than 10 days between July and October.  Chumall soils have relict mottles and are influenced by gypsum in the control section. Easychair soils have as much as 15 percent durinodes in the C horizon. Killpack and Littlehat soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Rosney soils have gypsum crystals at a depth of 16 to 42 inches and as much as 35 percent clay in the lower part of the control section.  Sagers and Sain soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Sondoa soils are stratified silt loam and silty clay loam, have more than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have large manganese oxide stains.  Swingler soils are moderately well drained with relict mottles at a depth that ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Tocito soils have secondary gypsum in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Timpie soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial flats, lake terraces, fan remnants, inset fans and dissected lake plains at elevations of 4,200 to 6,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.   These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from limestone and quartzite.  In Nevada these soil formed in alluvium with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The climate is arid.  Average annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 115 to 160 days."

Tooele soils have sandy loam textures throughout the profile.  Yenrab soils have loamy sand and sand textures throughout the profile."
