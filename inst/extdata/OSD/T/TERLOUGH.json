  "OVERVIEW": "The Terlough series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low terraces of mountain valley floors.  Terlough soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
