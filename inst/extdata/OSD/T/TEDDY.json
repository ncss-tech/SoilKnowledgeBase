  "OVERVIEW": "The Teddy series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that have a slowly permeable fragipan.  These soils formed in a loamy mantle over residuum weathered from limestone, shale, sandstone, and siltstone.  They are on nearly level to sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Laidig, Neabsco, and Tarklin series in the same family.  The Laidig soils contain 10 to 50 percent rock fragments in the horizons above the fragipan.  The Neabsco soils formed in fluvio- marine sediments on the coastal plain and contain rock fragments of mostly rounded quartz gravel.  Tarklin soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Series in similar families are Bedford and Sango soils.  Bedford soils are in a fine-silty family and have mixed mineralogy.  Sango soils are in a coarse-silty family and in the thermic temperature regime."
