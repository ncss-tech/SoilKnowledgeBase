    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid in the Ap and Bt horizons and is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the Btx, 2Bt, and 3Bt horizons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent in the Ap, Bt, and Btx horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the 2Bt horizon, and 10 to 45 percent in the 3Bt horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of  10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of gray and brown.  Texture is silt loam, clay loam, or loam.  Some pedons have silt coats in shades of gray along prism faces.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown, gray, or red.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of red, gray, or brown.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly modifiers.\nSome pedons have a 3C horizon with colors like the 3Bt horizon or is mottled in those colors without dominant matrix hue.  Texture is similar to the 3Bt horizon.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 10 to 45 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Laidig, Neabsco, and Tarklin series in the same family.  The Laidig soils contain 10 to 50 percent rock fragments in the horizons above the fragipan.  The Neabsco soils formed in fluvio- marine sediments on the coastal plain and contain rock fragments of mostly rounded quartz gravel.  Tarklin soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Series in similar families are Bedford and Sango soils.  Bedford soils are in a fine-silty family and have mixed mineralogy.  Sango soils are in a coarse-silty family and in the thermic temperature regime."
