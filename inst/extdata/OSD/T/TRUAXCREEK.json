  "OVERVIEW": "The Truaxcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on stream terraces, flood plains and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
