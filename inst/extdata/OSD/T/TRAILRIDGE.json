  "OVERVIEW": "The Trailridge series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from schist, gneiss, and granitic rocks.  Trailridge soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
