  "OVERVIEW": "The Tismid series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Tismid soils are on fan terraces, alluvial flats, cuesta dipslopes, and fan aprons.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Depth to the base of the natric horizon is 14 to 27 inches.  Calcium carbonate content is less than 15 percent.  Gypsum, if present, is less than 2 percent by weight.  Coarse fragment content is 0 to 10 percent pebbles throughout.  EC is variable but the A and Bt horizons are usually less than 2 mmhos, and lower horizons range from .5 to 4 mmhos in Bk and C horizons and up to 10 mmhos in Bkz horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  An E horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline\nThe Btn and Btnk horizons have hue 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Texture is commonly sandy clay loam or clay loam but the range includes loam.  Clay ranges from 20 to 35 percent and contains 15 to 40 percent exchangeable sodium.  The reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkz horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Texture is commonly sandy clay loam or loam, but the range includes clay loam.
