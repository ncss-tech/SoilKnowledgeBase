The soil is moist for about 100 days when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y or 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2 dry, and 2.5Y or 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/2 dry.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  The particle size control section is 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe C horizon is 2.5Y or 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y or 10YR 4/2, 4/3. 5/2, 5/4 or 6/4.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some areas have a few lime seams and are slightly effervescent in the lower part."
