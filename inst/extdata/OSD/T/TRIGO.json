The soil is moist for about 100 days when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y or 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2 dry, and 2.5Y or 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/2 dry.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  The particle size control section is 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe C horizon is 2.5Y or 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y or 10YR 4/2, 4/3. 5/2, 5/4 or 6/4.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some areas have a few lime seams and are slightly effervescent in the lower part."

Elevations are 200 to 2,000 feet in a semiarid mesothermal climate.  Precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with warm dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  The average January temperature is 45 degrees F.; an average July temperature 81 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 58 to 64 degrees F. The frost free season is 225 to 300 days."
