  "OVERVIEW": "The Tripp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty or loamy alluvium or loess. They are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F at the type location.",
