  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section during winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; When dry, vertical cracks 0.5 to 8 cm wide and 5 to 28 cm apart extend from the surface to at least 56 cm or to bedrock.  These cracks remain open from about June 1 through mid-December, about 200 days and are closed from January 1 to mid-April, more than 60 consecutive days; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.\nDepth to base of cambic horizon: 38 to 90 cm.\nDepth to bedrock: 50 to 90 cm to a paralithic contact; The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered andesite or basalt.  Hard, unweathered bedrock is usually within 100 cm.\nSlickensides and other vertic features: Wedge-shaped peds tilted 30 to 60 degrees from the horizontal and intersecting slickensides occur at some depth between 25 cm from the soil surface and the bedrock contact.\nOther features: Commonly, 35 to 60 percent rock fragments cover the soil surface, mostly stones and cobbles.  Micro hummocks 8 or 8 cm high occur between rock fragments.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 60 to 70 percent.\nA horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 or 5 moist or dry.\nChroma: 2 through 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nReaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.\nBw and Bss horizons, and BC horizon (when present)\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 or 5 moist or dry.\nChroma: 2 through 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nClay content: 60 to 70 percent.\nReaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.\nOther features: Identifiable secondary carbonates occur at depths from 23 to 30 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tunnison soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on depressions or summit positions.  These soils formed in materials derived from andesite or basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,405 to 1,942 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 330 mm.  Annual snowfall is 250 to 500 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
