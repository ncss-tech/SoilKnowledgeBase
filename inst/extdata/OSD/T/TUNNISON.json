  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunnison series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from andesite or basalt.  Tunnison soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

These cracks remain open from about June 1 through mid-December, about 200 days and are closed from January 1 to mid-April, more than 60 consecutive days; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.\nDepth to base of cambic horizon: 38 to 90 cm.\nDepth to bedrock: 50 to 90 cm to a paralithic contact; The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered andesite or basalt.  Hard, unweathered bedrock is usually within 100 cm.\nSlickensides and other vertic features: Wedge-shaped peds tilted 30 to 60 degrees from the horizontal and intersecting slickensides occur at some depth between 25 cm from the soil surface and the bedrock contact.\nOther features: Commonly, 35 to 60 percent rock fragments cover the soil surface, mostly stones and cobbles.  Micro hummocks 8 or 8 cm high occur between rock fragments.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 60 to 70 percent.\nA horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 or 5 moist or dry.\nChroma: 2 through 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nReaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.\nBw and Bss horizons, and BC horizon (when present)\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 or 5 moist or dry.\nChroma: 2 through 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nClay content: 60 to 70 percent.\nReaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.\nOther features: Identifiable secondary carbonates occur at depths from 23 to 30 inches in some pedons."
