  "OVERVIEW": "The Tresano series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, frigid family of Typic  Haplargids.  Typically, Tresano soils have grayish brown friable slightly alkaline sandy loam A1 horizons, brown slightly alkaline sandy clay loam B2t horizons, and grayish brown sandy clay loam B3ca and Cca horizons.",
