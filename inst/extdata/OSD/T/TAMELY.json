  "OVERVIEW": "The Tamely series consists of very deep , well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from argillite and quartzite with a thin mantel of volcanic ash. They are on mountains. Slope are 20 to 60 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Tamely soils have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 37 to 43 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature ranging from 45 to 49 degrees F. under varying densities of forest cover. Angular and subangular hard rock fragments increase with increasing depth from 15 to 30 percent in thin loess mantle to 50 to 80 percent of volume in underlying horizons. The soils range from slightly acid or moderately acid in their ash-rich mantle B horizons to very strongly acid in their 2E and B horizons. The ash-rich overlay ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, dry value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. This horizon has bulk density of .65 to .85 grams/cc, base saturation of 20 to 50, and cation exchange capacity relative to clay ranges from 1 to 3. It has 5 to 10 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent silt plus very fine sand. The E horizon portions of the horizon have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 3. The lamellae have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 2 through 4. The buried horizons range from loamy fine sand to loamy sand. They have estimated bulk density of 1.5 to 2, estimated base saturation of 50 to 90 percent and cation exchange capacity of .5 to 1 gram/gram of clay. Lamellae range from 1/32 to 1/2 inch thick and comprise 1 to 10 percent of the soil. These have from 15 to 25 percent clay and 30 to 50 percent silt."

They formed in an ash-rich thin loess mantle superimposed over residuum and colluvium from argillite and quartzitic rock. Mean annual precipitation is estimated as 40 to 65 inches with deep winter snow cover. Mean annual temperature is estimated as ranging from 34 to 45 degrees F. Mean summer temperature is estimated as less than 50 degrees F. under forest canopy."
