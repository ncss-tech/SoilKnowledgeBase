  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuohy series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granitic rocks. The Tuohy soils are on structural benches and mountain slopes in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 680 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
