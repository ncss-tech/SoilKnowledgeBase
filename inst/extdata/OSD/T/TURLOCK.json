The depth from the surface to the natric horizon (lower Bt) ranges from 9 to 28 inches.  The textural control section averages from 20 to 35 percent clay.  Organic matter is 1 to 4 percent in the A horizon.  The upper Bt horizon has less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 6/3.  Moist colors are 5Y 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 4/2; 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe E horizon has dry and moist color of 5Y 4/1, 5/2; 10YR 6/3 or 7/1. Some pedons do not have mottles.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  The reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 4/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 10YR 5/2.

Most of the soil areas are hummocky or channeled except where land leveled.  Elevations are 70 to 110 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.
