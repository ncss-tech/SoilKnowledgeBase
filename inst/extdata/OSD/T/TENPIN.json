  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenpin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and pyroclastic rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm.",
