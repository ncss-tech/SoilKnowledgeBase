  "STATES": "ID,MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tepete series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in herbaceous material overlying mixed alluvium. These soils form in swales, marshes, and depressions on the lower parts of fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 457 millimeters and the average annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
