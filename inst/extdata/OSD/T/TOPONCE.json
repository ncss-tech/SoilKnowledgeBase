  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Toponce series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  Permeability is slow.  These soils are on mountain slopes, foothills, and fan terraces.  They formed in colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks, predominantly sandstone and quartzite.  Slopes range from 4 to 40 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Hades and Pavohroo soils are fine-loamy.  Harkness soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Sedgway and Yago soils are skeletal.  Beaverdam, Harkness, Pavohroo, and Sedgway soils are at slightly higher elevations than Toponce and are on north- and east-facing mountain slopes.  Broadhead, Hades, and Yago soils are on similar landscape positions but are on south- and west-facing slopes."
