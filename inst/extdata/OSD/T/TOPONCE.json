  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Toponce soils are on foothills, mountain slopes, and fan terraces at elevations of 5,500 to 7,100 feet.  Slopes range from 4 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks, predominantly sandstone and quartzite.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 40 to 70 days."

Hades and Pavohroo soils are fine-loamy.  Harkness soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Sedgway and Yago soils are skeletal.  Beaverdam, Harkness, Pavohroo, and Sedgway soils are at slightly higher elevations than Toponce and are on north- and east-facing mountain slopes.  Broadhead, Hades, and Yago soils are on similar landscape positions but are on south- and west-facing slopes."
