Flanly soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and are formed from intrusive igneous rocks.  Sierra soils are fine-loamy throughout the argillic horizon, formed in residuum from granitic rocks and are well drained.  Verjeles soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and formed from basic igneous rocks.  Yellowlark soils are deep to weakly cemented duripan and are on intermediate fan terraces and stream terraces."
