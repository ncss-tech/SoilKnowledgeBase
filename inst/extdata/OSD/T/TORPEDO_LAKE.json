  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Torpedo Lake series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils formed in a mat of organic materials underlain by thin silty deposits over medium to fine-textured glacial till.  Torpedo Lake soils are in low depressions, drainageways, and seep areas on moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

The organic carbon content of the surface mineral layer ranges from 12 to 20 percent and this layer is part of the histic epipedon.  Texture of the control section includes loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Coarse fragment content of the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent with 0 to 5 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent gravel.  Matrix chromas of 1 or less occur within 20 inches of the mineral surface.  Reaction throughout the control section is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A1 horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A2 horizon, when present, has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe 2Bg horizon is gleyed sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."
