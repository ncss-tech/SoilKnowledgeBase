    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic mat ranges from 3 to 10 inches thick.  The organic carbon content of the surface mineral layer ranges from 12 to 20 percent and this layer is part of the histic epipedon.  Texture of the control section includes loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Coarse fragment content of the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent with 0 to 5 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent gravel.  Matrix chromas of 1 or less occur within 20 inches of the mineral surface.  Reaction throughout the control section is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A1 horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A2 horizon, when present, has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe 2Bg horizon is gleyed sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

They formed in thin silty deposits over firm medium to fine textured glacial till.  The climate is transitional between maritime and continental with the average annual precipitation ranging from 16 to 28 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F."
