  "OVERVIEW": "The Throckmorton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. The Throckmorton soils formed in loess, loamy glaciofluvium, and loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
