  "OVERVIEW": "The Tickville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from andesite.  Tickville soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
