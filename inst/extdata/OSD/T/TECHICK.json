  "OVERVIEW": "The Techick series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments over flood deposited sand and gravel on terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees.",
