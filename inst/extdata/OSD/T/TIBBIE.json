    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tibbie soils are on upland flats, toe slopes and gently sloping side slopes of the Southern Coastal Plain. They formed in fluvial material and slope alluvium over clayey Miocene-age sediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 61 inches."

Atmore soils are on lower positions and have coarse-loamy control sections.  The clayey Cowpen soils are on slightly higher positions.  The Escambia soils and Poarch soils are on higher positions and have coarse-loamy control sections.  Malbis soils are on higher positions and are well drained."

Common trees include longleaf pine, slash pine, sweetbay, white titi, and swamp red maple.  The understory vegetation consists of gallberry, several species of pitcher plants, Carolina red root, golden-crest, hatpins, clubmoss, sundew and other hydrophytic forbs and shrubs."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 21 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 21 to 42 inches (BE, Btv1 and Btv2 horizons).\nPlinthic horizon - the zone from 24 to 42 inches (Btv1 and Btv2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - seasonal saturation 0 to 1.0 feet.\nTibbie soils occur on landscapes that were formerly mapped as Plummer, Myatt, Rains and Smithton soils in older soil surveys.  They are typically poorly drained with gleyed redox depletions in the upper 10 inches of the profile.  However, these soils are generally considered non-hydric because they lack a required hydric soil field indicator at this time.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization Sample S07AL-129-004 (1-7).  Sample analyzed by NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nTibbie soils are in MLRA 133A.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
