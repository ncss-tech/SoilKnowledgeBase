  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The content of silt plus clay is 5 percent or less as a weighted average in the particle-size control section but is more than 5 percent in the upper 10 to 15 inches of the series control section. The soil has less than 10 percent weatherable minerals throughout (0.02 - 2 mm fraction). Volume of chert or sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Redox concentrations are within 72 inches and commonly within 40 inches.  Saturation typically occurs at 40 to 72 inches.   Saturation occurs within 40 inches in some pedons, for less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand.  In some pedons formed in residuum, it has thin strata of redder hue inherited from the parent material."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Boone, Carver, Hookson, and Tarr series.  Boone soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Carver soils have 25 percent or more coarse or very coarse sand and less than 50 percent of either medium, fine, or very fine sand.  Hookson soils (MAP=44 inches) are more moist in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice and they have 5 percent or less silt plus clay throughout.  Tarr soils do not have redox features or a zone of saturation within 60 inches."

Tint soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium or siliceous residuum from sandstone bedrock . Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet."

The excessively drained and moderately well drained Impact soils are in landscape positions slightly higher than, or similar to, those of Tint soils where there is a thick dark surface layer.  The somewhat poorly drained Majik soils and the excessively drained Tarr soils form a drainage sequence with Tint soils.  Tintson soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Tint soils where there is a loamy substratum at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."
