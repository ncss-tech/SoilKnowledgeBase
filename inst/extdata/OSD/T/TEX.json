  "OVERVIEW": "The Tex series consists of deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial till or outwash derived mainly from granite.  The soils are on moderately to steeply sloping glacial moraines and till plains.  The mean precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 32 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 60 inches.  The soil has hard setting properties when dry and has low volume change on wetting and drying.  In some pedons the A1 horizon is absent.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum, and are mainly fine angular granite pebbles.  The solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Usually this horizon has weak platy structure, but it has subangular blocky, parting to granular structure in some pedons.  It is slightly hard or hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 3 through 5.  The lamellae in this horizon are generally redder in hue or brighter in chroma that the matrix.  The composite texture of the B2t horizon is usually heavy coarse sandy loam or light coarse sandy clay loam, with the lamellae being principally coarse sandy clay loam or gritty clay loam.  The lamellae range in clay from 18 to 30 percent.  These horizons typically have hard-setting properties when dry and have a low volume change wetting and drying.]"
