The pH of the solum ranges from 5.8 to 6.8.  The pH of the substratum ranges from 5.0 to 5.8. Strata of coarse textured material may occur throughout the solum.  Some profiles have Ab horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw and 3Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe 2C horizons has textures that range from fine sandy loam to gravelly loamy sand. Some pedons do not have 2C horizons.\nThe 4C horizons have variegated colors.  They are very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 65 percent and include 30 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble."
