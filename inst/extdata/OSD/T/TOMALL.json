  "OVERVIEW": "The Tomall series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy colluvium overlying coarse textured outwash sediments on outwash plains, stream terraces and collapsed outwash in morainic areas. These soils have slopes of 0 to 6 percent. They have moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid or very rapid permeability in the lower part. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 60 inches in thickness and has fine strata. Depth to free carbonates is 45 to 80 inches. The depth to coarse textured material commonly ranges from 40 to 60 inches, but the extreme range is 30 to 72 inches. The control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  Some subhorizons may have up to 22 percent clay.  Pedons commonly are free of rock fragments in the loamy colluvium but may have as much as 5 percent, by volume. The volume of rock fragments in the C horizon ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Some pedons have an accumulation of clay in the subsoil but have less than a 1.2 B/A clay ratio.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. They are typically loam or sandy loam but include silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw and Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. They are loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam. Reaction is medium acid or neutral.  A BC horizon is present is some pedons.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Ankeny, Disco, Eyota and Lomax series do not have free carbonates in the C horizon.  The Billard series has a buried A horizon with organic carbon higher than the layers above.  Hanlon soils have chroma of 2 or less in the C horizon.  The Shellwood series have free carbonates in the A and B horizons."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in loamy colluvium overlying coarse textured outwash sediment. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 24to 32 inches. The frost-free days range from 120 to 165 days. Elevation above sea level is 700 to 1600 feet."

Estherville, Hawick, Malardi, and Salida soils are higher lying on backslopes, shoulder slopes and summit positions. Wadena soils occupy flats, swales and slight rises. Also the very poorly and poorly drained Biscay and very poorly drained Dassel and Medo soils are in swales and depressions."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon: the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 33 inches (Ap, A1, A2, and AB horizons); Cambic horizon:  the zone from 33 to 42 inches (Bw horizon); Cumulic based on colluvium having fine strata from periodic sediment moving downslope with rainfall events.  Often the color of the upper sediment is lighter than the original surface due to deposition; udic moisture regime."
