  "OVERVIEW": "The Tepecreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock. These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
