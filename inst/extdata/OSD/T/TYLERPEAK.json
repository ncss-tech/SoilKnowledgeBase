The mean summer soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry in soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice; udic soil moisture regime..  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent and a 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  The lower part of the particle size control section has 10 to 20 percent clay by apparent field texture.\nThe A and AB horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter with less than 7 percent below a depth of about 10 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam. Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter."
