  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tranquilar soils have formed in lacustrine and alluvial deposits on valley floors and on adjacent terrace positions.  The sediments were derived mainly from rhyolite, tuff, dacite, and latite.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 8,500 to 9,200 feet.  The climate is subhumid continental with a mean annual precipitation of about 20 to 25 inches. During spring and early summer there is a water table at 20 to 48 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 42 to 46 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 70 to 100 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cajete, Jarmillo, Jarola, and Hesperus series.  Cajete soils are formed in pumice and are ashy-skeletal.  Jarmillo soils lack an argillic horizon and are well drained.  Jarola soils are poorly drained, formed in alluvium and have a solum less than 35 inches thick.  Hesperus soils do not have albic horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 8 inches.  This pedon is a mollisol because colors above and below the albic horizon meet the criteria (0 to 11 inches and 13 to 20 inches; A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons.)\nAlbic horizon:  The zone from 11 to 13 inches.  (E horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 75 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nThe classification of this soil is changed from fine to very-fine based on NSSL lab data S 78-NM-43-11. The 12/2001 version changes the subgroup classification from Typic to Vertic.\nQuestions arose during the 12/2001 update of this description: The redox features in the E horizon suggest the depth to saturation may be shallower than stated. Additionally this series appears to include the poorly drained class. These characteristics were not revised, pending further mapping and study of this series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The pedon was described and sampled as number S78-NM-43-11.  It is part of a characterization study in the Baca Location, Sandoval County.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
