  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thebes soils are on wind-blown sandy hummocks, on outwash plains, alluvial terraces, and on upland ridges adjacent to stream valleys.  Slope gradients commonly are between 5 and 15 percent but range from 1 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying eolian loamy sand or sand.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.6 to 13.3 degrees C (51 to 56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches)."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: With this update the typical pedon is relocated to Mercer County, Illinois.  Thebes soils were previously correlated as fine-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal in Illinois and Iowa.  However, based on field investigations in Illinois and additional documentation, it is proposed, with this update, to classify the Thebes soils as fine-silty.\nThis pedon was checked in the field by SLE 2/17/1998 and adjustments were made in the description on depth of soil development, colors, and redoximorphic features.  The pedon number is 84IL-131-44.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 79 cm (9 to 31 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
