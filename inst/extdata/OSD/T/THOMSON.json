This revision changed the taxonomic classification from coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludult based on lab data. 10/06\nDTA-This revision changes the location to a more typical site, within the same map unit, and extends the description to 203 centimeters (80 inches).  The January 2026 revision updated the format.  No data was changed.  Molena Variant in Chester County is now named Thomson."
