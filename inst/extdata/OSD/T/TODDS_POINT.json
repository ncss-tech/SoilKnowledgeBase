  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the organic deposits is more than 130 cm. The soil ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in its natural condition and ultra-acid to neutral once oxidized. Mineral content (with varying textures from silty clay to sand) ranges from 5 to 50 percent throughout the profile. The electrical conductivity ranges from 0.6 to 4.5 dS/m in a 1:5 soil to water mixture by volume. Salt content ranges from about 5,000 to 35,000 ppm. The soil commonly is moderately saline in the surface tier and moderately saline to strongly saline in the subsurface and bottom tiers. In some places the range includes slightly saline.\nThe surface tier is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is typically hemic materials but some pedons have fibric materials. Unrubbed fiber content is 35 to 100 percent; rubbed fiber content ranges from 20 to 85 percent.\nThe subsurface tier is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. The organic materials are dominantly hemic but some pedons have layers of sapric materials up to 30 cm thick. Unrubbed fiber content is 20 to 70 percent; rubbed fiber content is less than 40 percent.\nThe bottom tier is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Unrubbed fiber content is 10 to 50 percent; rubbed fiber content is less than 40 percent.\nSome pedons have thin mineral horizons less than 30 cm thick between organic horizons within 130 cm of the surface. Mineral horizons below a depth of 130 cm are common. Textures range from silty clay loam to sand or their mucky modifier in the mineral portions of the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Todds Point soils are level and occur in tidal marshes along the coast of Maine. These soils are subject to tidal flooding twice daily except in areas protected by dikes and tide gates. These soils formed in partially decomposed organic material from salt tolerant herbaceous plants. The climate is cool temperate and humid. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1600 to 2200 mm."

Fort Knox soils have organic materials 40 to 130 cm thick and are underlain by loamy mineral materials. Gouldsboro soils are fine-silty mineral soils with a thin to absent organic cap less than 20 cm thick. Petit Manan soils have organic materials 20 to 40 cm thick and are underlain by fine-silty mineral material. Pemaquid soils have organic materials between 40 and 130 cm thick but are underlain by sandy mineral materials. Phippsburg soils have an organic cap that ranges from 20 to 40 cm thick and are underlain by sandy mineral materials. Damariscotta soils are sandy mineral soils with a thin to absent organic cap less than 20 cm thick."

The most common grasses are marsh hay cordgrass, smooth cordgrass, and seashore saltgrass. Other vegetation includes sea lavender, glasswort, seaside goldenrod, and sea-blite."
