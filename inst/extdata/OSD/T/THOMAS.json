  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Thomas series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials less than 41 cm (16 inches) thick overlying loamy till or lacustrine materials. These soils are on till plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",
