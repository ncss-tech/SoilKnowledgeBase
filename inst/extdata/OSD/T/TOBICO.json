  "OVERVIEW": "The Tobico series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy materials on outwash plains and lake benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
