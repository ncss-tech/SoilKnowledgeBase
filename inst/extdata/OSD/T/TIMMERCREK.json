  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Timmercrek soils are on moraines. These soils formed in glacial till dominantly from quartzite, with local admixture from shale or argillite. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,840 to 3,430 meters. The climate is humid with cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, most of which falls as snow. The mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 30 to 50 days."
