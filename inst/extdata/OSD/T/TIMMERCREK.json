  "OVERVIEW": "The Timmercrek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till dominantly from quartzite, with local admixtures of shale or argillite. The Timmercrek soils are on moraines. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
