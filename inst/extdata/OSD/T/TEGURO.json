  "OVERVIEW": "The Teguro series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff, basalt and similar rock. Teguro soils are on foothills, lava plateaus and mountain side slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
