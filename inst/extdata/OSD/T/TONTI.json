  "STATES": "AR,KS,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonti series consists of very deep, moderately well drained that formed in residuum from cherty limestone.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on uplands of the Ozark Highlands.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

Califon soils formed in old till or colluvium and have rock fragments derived predominantly from granitic gneiss.  Delassus soils formed in loess with the underlying residuum weathered from granite or other igneous rock. Meckesville soils have 5YR or redder hues in the fragipan. Watson soils formed in till and contain sandstone and shale fragments."
