  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Califon, Delassus, Meckesville, and Watson series.  Califon soils formed in old till or colluvium and have rock fragments derived predominantly from granitic gneiss.  Delassus soils formed in loess with the underlying residuum weathered from granite or other igneous rock. Meckesville soils have 5YR or redder hues in the fragipan. Watson soils formed in till and contain sandstone and shale fragments."

Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent, but dominantly are less than 8 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 46 inches."
