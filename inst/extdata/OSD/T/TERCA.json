Cooperopolis soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have ashy modified surface textures.  Laric soils are 13 to 30 cm to a lithic contact.  Malinda Marlic soils have 35 to 40 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  McQuarrie soils have a subhorizon in the lower part of the argillic horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline reaction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Terca soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,495 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 95 days."
