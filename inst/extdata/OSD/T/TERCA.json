  "OVERVIEW": "The Terca series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Terca soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
