(0 to 16 inches thick)\nOa--8 to 65 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) muck; weak medium subangular blocky structure; about 30 percent fiber unrubbed, about 10 percent rubbed; about 30 percent mineral; slightly acid."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soil reaction is 4.5 or more in calcium chloride or moderately acid to moderately alkaline by Helig-Truog method. Thickness of the organic materials is more than 51 inches. A limestone substratum phase at a 60 to 80-inch depth is recognized.\nWhere present, the Oap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. Fiber content is between 10 and 30 percent unrubbed and less than 10 percent rubbed.  The surface layer is hemic or fibric in some pedons. Texture is muck.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. Fiber content ranges from 5 to 70 percent unrubbed and from 1 to 17 percent rubbed. Fibers are typically those of non-woody plants, but in some pedons, fibers from woody plants occur and range from about 5 to 30 percent unrubbed, of the organic volume. Mineral content of this horizon between depths of 16 to 51 inches ranges from about 5 to 40 percent.\nSome pedons have Oi or Oe horizons below a depth of 51 inches and have the same colors and textures as the Oa horizon.\nSome pedons have a Cg horizon below a depth of 55 inches. Where present, it has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Textures range from sand to clay. Fragments of shell or hard limestone may be present."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Torry series is the only soil in the same family. The Everglades, Hontoon, and Okeechobee series are in closely similar families. Torry soils have more than 40 percent mineral material in the subsurface tier. Everglades and Okeechobee soils have hemic layers in the control section. Hontoon soils are dysic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Terra Ceia soils are mostly in nearly level fresh water marshes or in depressions within areas of flatwoods. Some areas are in river flood plains or tidal areas flooded daily by brackish water. They formed largely from non-woody fibrous remains of hydrophytic plants. Slopes are less than 1 percent. The climate is humid subtropical. The average annual rainfall ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Anclote, Chobee, Delray, Floridana, Manatee, Pompano and Winder soils are mineral soils. Canova and Tequesta soils are mineral soils having a surface consisting of a histic epipedon that is less than 16 inches in thickness.  Lauderhill soils have a shallow histic epipedon over limestone bedrock.  Gator and Okeelanta soils have a histic epipedon 16 to 50 inches in thickness. Pahokee soils have a histic epipedon 36 to 50 inches in thickness overlying limestone bedrock."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; rapid permeability and internal drainage; slow to ponded runoff. In drained areas, water control systems regulate the level of the water table to depths of 12 to 48 inches, depending on the crop grown. In undrained areas, the water table is at or above the soil surface except during extended dry periods. Areas on flood plains are flooded for long duration."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Drained areas are used for truck and bulb crops, sugarcane, and improved pasture. Large undeveloped areas are used for water storage and as wildlife habitat. The natural vegetation consists of sawgrass, lilies, sedges, reeds, maidencane, spikerush, and other aquatic plants. Wooded plant species include cypress, blackgum, cabbage palm, carolina ash, loblolly bay, red maple, sweetbay, and pond pine. American and white mangrove trees are dominant in tidal areas."
