    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Teewee soils are on gently sloping to very steep side slopes of mountains and hills.  Elevation is 2500 to 3500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent. The soil formed in residuum derived from andesite or basalt with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 25 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
