  "OVERVIEW": "The Teequee series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Teequee soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
