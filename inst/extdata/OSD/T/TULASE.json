  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tulase soils are on lagoons, inset fans, fan skirts, and drainageways.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,530 to 2,280 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
