  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches in thickness.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6; mottles with chroma of 2 or less, are few in the upper part of the Bt horizon, and common or many in the lower part; or the horizons are mottled in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is silt or silt loam.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon has 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E/Bb horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6, and chroma of 1 to 3 in the E part, and hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 in the B part.  It is silt or silt loam.  It is slightly brittle in the brown part, which commonly is 20 to 40 percent of the mass.  Black or brown concretions, if present, are few to many.\nThe B/Eb horizon has the B part mottled in shades of brown and gray.  It is silt or silt loam.  The E part is tongues of gray silt between the prisms and coatings on the faces of prisms; these make up 15 to 30 percent of the mass."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Closely related series include the Bude, Calloway, Duralde, Frizzell, Gillsburg, and Leverett series.  Bude and Calloway soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section and have a fragipan.  Duralde soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section.  Frizzell soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Gillsburg soils have a thick A horizon of recent sediment and are grayer in the B horizon.  Leverett soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tippo soils are on broad flood plains or low stream terraces along streams in the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands.  These are nearly level to gently sloping soils.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in silty sediment.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 53 inches and the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Leverett series and the Bonn, Cascilla, Collins, and Falaya series.  Well drained Leverett soils are in similar positions as the Tippo series.  Poorly drained Bonn soils, which are on associated broad flats and in depressions, have a natric horizon and the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Well drained Cascilla soils do not have a Bt horizon and are on natural levees.  Moderately well drained Collins soils and somewhat poorly drained Falaya soils mainly are on rather wide flood plains, and, in addition, the Collins soils have thin stratifications in the upper 20 inches of the soil, and Falaya soils do not have an upper Bt horizon."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

In wet seasons late in winter and early in spring, water is perched at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 feet.  Some areas of these soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding for brief periods late in winter and early in spring."
