  "OVERVIEW": "The Tweener series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff, rhyolite, chert, shale and conglomerate.  The Tweener soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Gabica soils have moisture control sections that are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days and are 30 to 50 cm deep to bedrock.  Genoa and Shalcleav soils average more than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Gerdog and Mattier soils have a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic. Hawkridge soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 7 degrees C. Hutchley soils contain fragments of quartz latite mainly of gravel size.  Pernog soils have a mollic epipedon more than 30 cm thick. Rozara soils contain 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
