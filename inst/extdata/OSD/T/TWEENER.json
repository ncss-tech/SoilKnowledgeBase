Gabica soils have moisture control sections that are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days and are 30 to 50 cm deep to bedrock.  Genoa and Shalcleav soils average more than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Gerdog and Mattier soils have a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic. Hawkridge soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 7 degrees C. Hutchley soils contain fragments of quartz latite mainly of gravel size.  Pernog soils have a mollic epipedon more than 30 cm thick. Rozara soils contain 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuffs, rhyolite, chert, shale, and conglomerate.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,650 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is cool semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summer.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
