  "OVERVIEW": "The Teebone series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks. The Teebone soils are on lake plains and basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
