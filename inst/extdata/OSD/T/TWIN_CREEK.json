  "OVERVIEW": "The Twin Creek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from siltstone and sandstone and from scoria or porcelanite beds. These soils are on terraces, footslopes and fans in narrow valleys within sedimentary uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
