  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 92 centimeters. Depth to serpentinite bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 0 to 85 percent by volume with more than 35 percent (weighted average) rock fragments in the control section. The soil texture is loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Ap, A or AB horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It has weak to strong granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It has moderate subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. The horizon is structureless/massive and consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons have a thin Cr horizon just above the serpentine bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Todthill soils are nearly level to very steep soils on bedrock-controlled hills and ridges on glaciated uplands. They developed in a mantle of supraglacial melt-out till (Wisconsinan age) mainly derived from serpentinite and red sandstone, siltstone, and/or shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 75 percent. The climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1011 to 1283 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees Celsius. The frost-free period is 210 to 235 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boonton, Branford, Cheshire, Fredon, Haledon, Hasbrouck, Ludlow, Manchester, Penwood, Wotalf, Wethersfield, and Wilbraham soils.  Boonton, Haledon, and Hasbrouck soils formed in till derived from red sedimentary rocks and basalt and contain argillic horizons and fragipan restrictions.  Branford, Fredon, Manchester and Penwood formed in glaciofluvial deposits derived from red sedimentary rock. Cheshire soils formed in melt-out till derived from red sedimentary rock and/or basalt and are very deep to bedrock contact. Ludlow, Wethersfield and Wilbraham soils formed in lodgment till derived from red sedimentary rock and/or basalt. Wotalf soils formed in the same parent material as Todthill and are shallow to serpentine bedrock contact."
