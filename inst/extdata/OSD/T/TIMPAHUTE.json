  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe soils are usually dry during most years, mainly during summer and autumn. Thickness of the solum and depth to the duripan ranges from 19 to 30 inches. The upper part of the solum is noncalcareous and ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline, and the lower part of solum and the C horizon are calcareous and are moderately to strongly alkaline.  As much 85 3 percent of the Surface is covered by stones. The A1 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak or moderate, thin to very thick platy structure, or is massive. Where the soil has an A2 horizon it commonly has weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular or subangular blocky structure. Some pedons have thin, continuous or discontinuous A2 horizons. The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5. At least the B21t horizon has moderate to strong, fine to coarse prismatic structure and the lower part of the B2t horizon has weak to strong, fine to coarse subangular blocky, weak to moderate, fine to coarse prismatic structure.  The argillic horizon is predominantly light clay, but the range includes sandy clay, heavy clay loam, and the lower part is clay loam or sandy clay loam in some pedons. The B horizon averages more than 35 percent clay. The B2t horizon contains more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in at least some part. In some pedons some subhorizon of the B horizon contains as much as 30 percent by volume of gravel. Few to many, fine to coarse white pinkish gray or very pale brown lime segregations are in the lower part of the B horizon. The duripan ranges from 6 to 30 inches in thickness. The thinner duripans are completely indurated and others consist of 1 to 4 inch-thick indurated layers interbedded with noncemented to strongly cemented layers. The C horizon under the duripan is either loamy or sandy and contains as much as 80 percent pebbles and cobblestones."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cortez, Fertaline and Tickapoo series.  The Cortez soils have 4 to 14 inch-thick A horizons and abrupt change in texture from the A to B horizon, having more than 15 percent clay increase.  Fertaline soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 47 F. and have thin A2 horizons.  Tickapoo soils have weakly cemented hardpans consisting of discontinuous indurated silica laminae less than 1/4 inch thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Timpahute soils are on smooth, nearly level to strongly sloping old dissected alluvial fans at elevations ranging from 4,800 to 6,300 feet and have slope gradients of O to 15 percent. The fans have been truncated by intermittent stream channels up to 15 or 20 feet deep.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium mostly from ignimbrite but containing some material from andesite, basalt, obsidian, and sandstone.  The climate is cool, semiarid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, the average annual temperature from 47 to 54 F., and the frost-free season from 115 to 150 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cliffdown, Crestline, Dixie, Leo and Neola soils and the competing Tickapoo soils. Cliffdown, Crestline, and Leo soils have, in a major part of the control section, more than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments. Dixie soils lack natric horizons and silica-cemented hardpans. Neola soils lack argillic horizons and have petrocalcic horizons at depths of less than 20 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was inactivated in August 2008 for several reasons.  The extensive revision of the soil survey of Meadow Valley Area (NV613) no longer correlated the series and the type location was mapped over with other series.  The Timpahute series as mapped in the soil survey of Pahranagat-Penoyer Area (NV611) has a questionable concept on which moisture subclass typifies the series as mapped.  The series is correlated to Ecological Site R029XY006NV, Loamy 8-10 P.Z. in the Pahranagat-Penoyer Area, but text in the survey publication indicates a drier ecological site (6-8 P.Z.) may be more appropriate.  The remaining acres of Timpahute are currently correlated to the Lojet series until a future update occurs.\nThe revision of December 2004 corrected the type location section and other minor format errors.  The presence of a natric horizon in the typical pedon is questionable due to relatively low pH (neutral reaction) for most of the zone of clay accumulation.  If only the 22 to 25 inch horizon has high sodium content, then the pedon fails to have a natric horizon.  Further field study of this soil is needed to determine whether it should be reclassified to the subgroup of Xeric Argidurids and to determine the best method to update the series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
