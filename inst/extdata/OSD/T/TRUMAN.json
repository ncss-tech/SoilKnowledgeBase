  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates ranges from 46 to 142 cm (18 to 56 inches). Rock fragments are lacking in the solum and C horizon. In some pedons secondary accumulations of free carbonates comprise as much as 5 percent of the volume of the lower part of the B horizon or upper part of the C horizon. The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches) in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has a matrix hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It has mottles in the lower part of some pedons. It typically is silt loam throughout, but in some pedons it has subhorizons of silty clay loam. It is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and moderately acid through moderately alkaline in the lower part.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC or C horizon has a matrix hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6. It has mottles in some to all parts in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline. It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 15 percent. It has a calcic horizon in the upper part in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Galva, Keg, Marshall, Monona, Nira, Northboro, Ponca, Port Byron, Raddle, Sac, and Salix series of the same family and the closely related Kingston series. The Galva soils formed in loess and have less sand in the solum. The Keg soils have lower chroma and yellower hue in at least part of the B horizon. The Marshall, Port Byron, and Raddle soils have thicker sola. The Monona soils have systematic decrease in clay with depth and have uniform coarse silt-fine ratios. The Nira soils have lower chroma in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon. The Northboro soils have redder hue in the B horizon. The Ponca soils have thinner sola and free carbonates at shallower depths. The Sac soils have loam or clay loam 2C horizons beginning above depths of 102 cm (40 inches). The Salix soils have lower chroma in at least part of the B horizon. The Kingston soils have lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have convex slopes with gradients of 1 to 25 percent on nearly level to steep lacustrine-mantled ground moraines or on lake plains. They formed in silty calcareous lacustrine sediments that are more than 1.2 m (4 feet) in thickness. Calcareous loam glacial till commonly underlies these sediments. The sediments are from the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsin glaciation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from660 to 813 mm (26 to 32 inches), and mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Frost free days range from 155 to 200. Elevation is 244 to 479 m (800 to 1,570 feet) above sea level"

The Kingston soils are moderately well drained and the Madelia and Spicer soils are poorly drained."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic features and properties are: Mollic epipedon: the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches) (Ap and AB horizons), Cambic horizon: the zone from36 to 152 cm (14 to 60 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, BC1, and BC2 horizons).\nA new series is needed to replace Truman soils mapped on slopes of 6 to 25 percent.  Saturation within 3.5 feet is typical on B slopes; however, it is not common or typical to have saturation on steeper slopes.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station Central File Code No. 1607 for results of some laboratory analysis of the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
