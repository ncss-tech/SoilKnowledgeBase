Ferrogold, Orrubo, Wechech, and Wodovar soils are in the Mohave Desert receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November.  Neso soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 59 to 62 degrees F. In addition, Neso soils are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys and are moist in May and June.  Orrubo soils have Cr horizons below the hardpan at depths between 17 and 30 inches.  Paisano and Philder soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods (ustic-aridic).  Infantry and Sutherland soils are inactive."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tencee soils are along terrace remnants and dissected scarps cut in old soils of relic Mid- Pleistocene basin floors.  Erosion has partly or wholly truncated horizons once overlying the petrocalcic horizon.  The soils are in narrow fingerlike patterns between the level or nearly level basin floor and steeper slopes that descent to the adjacent valley bottom.  Small arroyos rising from the valley have cut old soils at the margin of the basin floor.  The resultant landscape along the scarp consists of discontinuous ridges capped by the prominent light colored petrocalcic horizon.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent on the ridge crests while ridge side slopes are steeper ranging from about 10 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 2400 to 6000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 180 to 250 days."

Cruces and Upton soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Delnorte soils have mixed mineralogy.  Tonuco soils are sandy."
