  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tsammana series consists of deep well-drained soils formed in sandy eolian and alluvial deposits with an admixture near the surface of coarse grained, eolian, glassy volcanic material and basalt stones and boulders.  Tsammana soils are on beach terraces and footslopes of dipslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
