Mohall, Snaggletooth, and Tucson soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Orita soils have buried A and B horizons. Snaggletooth soils are in the Colorado Desert of southeastern California (MLRA 31) and are moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tremant soils are on fan terraces, stream terraces or relict basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations are 400 to 2500 feet.  These soils formed in fan and stream alluvium from mixed sources and eolian sediments.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 2 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 67 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 260 to 325 days."
