  "OVERVIEW": "The Teagard series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C). They formed in material weathered from Kiowa shale of Cretaceous age. Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to secondary calcium carbonates ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Cracks more than 1cm wide extend from the surface to depths of greater than 12 inches during some season in most years. Slickensides range from few to common.  The 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay content.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 45 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The A horizon is typically calcareous but some pedons may be noncalcareous.\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  COLE exceeds 0.07.  Vertical cracks are filled with darker material from the A horizon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and calcareous.  Some pedons have relic redoximorphic features in shades of yellowish brown and gray.\nThe BCkss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is clay, silty clay, and shaly clay.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  COLE exceeds 0.07.  Some vertical cracks are filled with darker material from the A horizon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and calcareous.  Pockets and discontinuous strata of weathered shale make up 5 to 50 percent of this horizon.  Some pedons have relic redoximorphic features in shades of yellowish brown, gray, yellow, or red.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is clay or clayey shale.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and calcareous.(5 to 12 inches thick)\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  This is highly stratified dark gray or gray shale with pockets and interbedded strata of yellow (10YR 5/8), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6, 6/8), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4), and light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4).  Reaction is moderately alkaline.  The shale matrix ranges from calcareous to noncalcareous, but cracks and strata faces are coated with powdery calcium carbonate.  This is non-paralithic material with rock like structure, is root restrictive, and fractures may be less than 10 cm apart or greater than 10 cm apart.  This material has low to moderate excavation difficulty.  Most of this material will slake in water within 15 hours."
