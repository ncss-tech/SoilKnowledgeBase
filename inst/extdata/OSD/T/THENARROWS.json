The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 46 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay. Redoximorphic iron concentrations and depletions are present throughout the profile in some pedons.  The soil is calcareous throughout the profile and all carbonates are disseminated.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR; a value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  SAR is 13 to 25 and EC is 2 to 5.\nThe B horizon has a value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  SAR is 10 to 20 and EC is 1 to 3.  The percent calcium carbonate is 10 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has a value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and a chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline.  Effervescence is slightly to strongly effervescent.  SAR is 2 to 5 and EC is 0 to 2."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n- Ochric epipedon\n- Some pedons have a calcic horizon.  The type pedon has a decrease of 4 percent (absolute) of calcium carbonate between the A/Bw and Bw horizon; thus type pedon lacks a calcic horizon, criteria 3a for calcic horizon.  All carbonates are disseminated throughout the profile; thus criteria 3c3 is not met.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference samples S95OR-025-001; data from type location.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
