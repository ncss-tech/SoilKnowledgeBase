  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and 0 to 35 percent in the substratum and are mainly\nweathered limestone, schist and quartzite. Sand-sized mica grains are visible in all horizons.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum and slightly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand in the fine earth fraction but the range includes fine sandy loam within 10 inches of the mineral soil surface.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loamy sand or sand in the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Teago soils are on bedrock-controlled glaciated uplands. They developed in coarse textured, friable till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from mica schist, phyllite and crystalline limestone. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches and is well distributed throughout the growing season. The Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 135 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buckland, Cabot, Dummerston, Glover, Pomfret, and Vershire soils. Buckland and Cabot soils are on foot slopes and toe slopes and have densic materials in the substratum. Glover and Vershire soils are on adjacent, bedrock controlled landforms. Glover soils are shallow to bedrock and Vershire soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Dummerston and Pomfret soils are on similar landforms. Dummerston soils are very deep to\nbedrock and Pomfret soils are deep or very deep to bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The classification is corrected with this revision. The Sandy particle-size class name is redundant in Psammentic subgroups and therefore is dropped.\n2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon and upper 2 inches of the Bw1, when mixed).\nb. Lack of a cambic horizon. (Bw horizons have texture coarser than loamy very fine sand below 10 inches in depth.)\nc. Sandy particle-size class.\nd. Lithic contact - 32 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory.  Pedon no. S00VT-027-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
