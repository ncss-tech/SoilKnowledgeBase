  "OVERVIEW": "The Tellico series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum from reddish quartzose limestone and calcareous sandstone and shale.  The upper part of the profile may be affected by soil creep in steep and very steep areas.  These soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep ridge tops and moderately steep to very steep backslopes.",

Fragments of partly weathered sandstone or shale, or both, range from 0 to about 25 percent in the solum and from 2 to about 80 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction in each horizon is very strongly acid to moderately acid, except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Dry value is 4 or less.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Content of fine and medium black and brown concretions ranges from none to common.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or clay.  Content of fine and medium black and brown concretions ranges from none to common.\nWhen present, the C horizons has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Pockets and layers of material that have value of 2 and chroma of 2 or 3 are common.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nWhen present, the Cr horizon is reddish decalcified soft quartzose limestone or calcareous sandstone and shale."

Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from reddish quartzose limestone, or calcareous sandstone and shale.  In steep and very steep areas the upper portion of the profile may be affected by soil creep.  At a site about 15 miles from the type location, mean annual air temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches."

Alcoa soils are on adjacent stream terraces and foot slopes and do not have a clay decrease by 20 percent or more within 60 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Neubert soils are on adjacent flood plains and formed in alluvium.  Red Hills (tentative) soils are on adjcaent side slopes and do not have an argillic horizon and have soft bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Steekee soils have a discontinuous argillic horizon and are less than 20 inches to soft bedrock."

Depth to hard bedrock was changed to very deep based on field notes and reexamination of the type location.\nDiagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 4 inches, A horizon\nRhodic feature:  0 to 70 inches\nArgillic horizon:  4 to 61 inches, Bt horizons\nLaboratory data available:  Particle size data on the previous type location by the University of Tennessee, 04/70;  Data on two additional pedons in Loudon County, TN by the NSSL Lincoln, NE; S58TN-53-3 and S58TN-53-4.  Lab data show that the particle-size control section is close to the fine-loamy family.  Also have characterization data for the this type location S95TN107-7.\nSIR = TN0116\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
