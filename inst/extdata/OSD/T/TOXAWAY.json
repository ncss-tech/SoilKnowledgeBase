  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  The loamy horizons are commonly 40 to 60 inches thick over sandy subhorizons.  Depth to bedrock is more than 10 feet.  The soil is strongly acid to slightly acid unless limed.  Flakes of mica range from few to many.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the A horizon and 0 to 15 percent in the Cg horizon.\nOrganic matter content of the A horizon is medium to high.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  The A horizon is silt loam or loam.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon.  The Ab horizon, where present has the same color and texture range as the A horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The C horizon is stratified alluvial sediments of clay loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, often with lenses and strata of loamy sand or sand.  Gravel or cobbles are in the C horizons in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Toxaway soils are on nearly level flood plains of mountain valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvial deposits.  Elevations are above 2,000 feet.  Mean annual temperature near the type location is 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arkaqua, Biltmore, Chatuge, Colvard, Codorus, Comus, Cullowhee, Dellwood, Dillard, Dillsboro, French, Hatboro, Hemphill, Iotla, and Kinkora, Nikwasi, Reddies, Rosman, Statler, Sylva, Transylvania, Whiteside series.  All of these series except Chatuge, Hatboro, Hemphill, Kinkora, Nikwasi, and Sylva are better drained than Toxaway soils.  Chatuge, Hatboro, Hemphill, and Kinkora have an argillic horizon, and Nikwasi is in a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal family.  Also, none have an umbric epipedon thicker than 24 inches except Nikwasi and Transylvania soils.  Arkaqua, Biltmore, Colvard, Codorus, Comus, French, Iotla, Reddies, Rosman, and Transylvania soils are on higher parts of the flood plain or are nearer to stream channels.  Chatuge, Dillard, Dillsboro, Hatboro, Hemphill, kinkora, and Statler soils are on stream terraces nearby.  Sylva and Whiteside soils are on colluvial fans and toe slopes that do not flood."
