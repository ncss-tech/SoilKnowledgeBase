Alvey soils have hue of 10YR or yellower. Barx soils contain 2.5YR and 5YR hue. Cerrillos soils have a calcic horizon less than 20 inches deep. Clovis soils receive more than half of it annual precipitation between the months of July and October. Fernando soils contain 50 to 80 percent silt in the solum and are mapped in MLRA 51. Cabreros, Flaco, Horchata, Progresso, Sanostee, and Threetop soils are moderately deep over bedrock. Maysdorf soils contain less than 15 percent carbonates in the calcic horizon. Millett soils contain 25 to 75 percent gravel and cobbles in the lower part of the solum. Palabria soils are deep to sandstone. Selpats soils have skeletal lithologic discontinuity at depths ranging from 15 to 39 inches. Scholle soils contain 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. Solirec soils receive maximum precipitation in spring and fall. Wineg soils have a MAST of 56 degrees F, and have mixed gravelly alluvium or lacustrine parent material. Cerrillos, Clovis, Millett and Scholle soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the B2t horizon. Fernando soils are deeper than 20 inches to the calcic horizon. Spenlo soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick and are noncalcareous to a depth of 35 to 44 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tuweep soils are on plateaus and mesas with gradients of 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,400 feet. They formed in basalt and pyroclastics including cinders, tuff and volcanic breccia. The climate is semiarid with average annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and as winter rain and snow. The average annual air temperature is 54 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 120 to 180 days."
