The soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. A water table is present at its upper most limit from March to June. Depth to redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less is 10 to 20 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to a buried soil (2Bwb) is 40 to over 60 inches. Pumice fragments (paragravel) are 2 to 76 millimeters in diameter and the particle-size control section averages 5 to 35 percent pumice fragments. Field estimated clay content is 0 to 5 percent. The soil contains 70 to 100 percent glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.9 percent, 15 bar water content of 4 to 7 percent on both dried and undried samples and moist bulk density of 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is ashy coarse sandy loam or ashy loamy coarse sand. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe AB or BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.

Chock soils have a medial loam surface horizon 5 to 20 inches thick that has 12 to 30 percent 15 bar water and ashy sandy loam and ashy loam subsoil horizons with 8 to 12 percent 15 bar water. Tonata soils have ashy silt loam textures throughout the profile and have a mollic epipedon. Chocknott soils have an umbric epipedon."
