They formed in slope alluvium derived from Quaternary loess and volcanic ash and Tertiary basalt.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Calabasas soils have a calcic horizon and durinodes within 40 inches overlying a duripan within 60 inches, and occur on summits of undulting plateaus.  Panky soils are fine-loamy, have upper argillic horizons that contain more than 35 percent clay, and occur on summits of erosional fan remnants.  Zepol soils are fine-silty, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on narrow flood plains of valley floors."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches. (AE horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 3 to about 21 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 57 to about 77 inches. (Bk1 horizon)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of Bt2 and Btk1 horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 77 inches.\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed than most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  Typical totals of aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages are less than 0.20.  Tetilla soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S92NM-049-003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
