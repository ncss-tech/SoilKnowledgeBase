Adaton, Amagon, and Dundee soils have A and E horizons with a combined thickness of less than 24 inches.

These soils formed in silty sediments from loess, or from loess mixed with silty alluvium. The mean annual\nprecipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F near the type location."

Arkabutla, Falaya, and Oaklimeter soils, which occur on similar floodplains, do not have argillic horizons. Foley soils, which\noccur on adjacent terraces contain a natric horizon. Calhoun, Calloway, Grenada, Hillemann and Loring soils occur on adjacent loess covered terraces. Calhoun soils contain a glossic horizon. Calloway, Grenada and Loring soils contain a fragipan. Hillemann soils contain a natric horizon."
