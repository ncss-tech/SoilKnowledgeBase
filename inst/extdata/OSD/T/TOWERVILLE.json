  "STATES": "NY,OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Towerville series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in Wisconsinan age till derived from shale, siltstone and small amounts of sandstone on glaciated dissected plateaus. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper part of the subsoil and moderately low or moderately high in the lower part of the subsoil and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments, mainly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent in the upper part of the mineral solum, and from 10 to 60 percent in the lower part of the solum and substratum, with the weighted average throughout the soil being less than 35 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid, unless limed. Undisturbed pedons have an O and/or A horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to coarse, subangular blocky, sometimes parting to platy. Consistence is very friable to firm. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid. Some pedons have an AB horizon just above the B horizon.\nThe BC horizon, or C horizon in some pedons, has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky, prismatic or platy in the BC horizon. Some pedons have a C horizon that is massive. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a 2BC or 2C horizon with hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Structure is weak or moderate, subangular blocky, prismatic or platy. Consistence is friable to very firm. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a 2Cr horizon up to 8 inches thick just above the bedrock.\nThe 2R horizon is shale, siltstone or sandstone bedrock that is often interbedded."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Schuyler series is in the same family. Schuyler soils have bedrock at depths greater than 80 inches.\nChautauqua, Fremont, Hornell, Ischua, and Orpark are similar soils in related families. Chautauqua soils are very deep and have a coarse loamy particle-size control section. Fremont soils are very deep and both Fremont and Orpark soils have aquic moisture regimes. Hornell soils have a fine particle size control section. Ischua soils are the frigid analog of Towerville."

In some pedons the lower part of the subsoil and substratum formed in residuum. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from 110 to 167 days, and elevation ranges from 720 to 1,800 feet above msl."

The somewhat poorly drained Orpark and poorly drained Patchin soils are in a drainage sequence with Towerville soils. Bath, Langford, Mardin and Volusia soils all have fragipans and are closely associated on nearby landscapes. The somewhat poorly drained Busti, moderately well drained Chautauqua, and well drained Chadakoin are very deep soils on nearby landscapes The somewhat excessively drained Chenango soils are on nearby glaciofluvial terraces. The Fremont and Schuyler soils are on similar nearby landforms where the till is thicker over bedrock. The well drained Unadilla soils are on nearby lake plains and valley terraces."
