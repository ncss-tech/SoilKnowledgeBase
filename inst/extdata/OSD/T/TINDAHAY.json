  "OVERVIEW": "The Tindahay series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in mixed alluvium or eolian deposits. Tindahay soils are on plains and valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 4 to 10 percent clay and 75 to 90 percent sand.  Horizons 3 to 15 inches thick occur within the upper 10 to 25 inches of the particle-size control section that are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam with clay content of 7 to 18 percent.  Textures below this layer are sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand with 0 to 8 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent fine gravel.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. The dark color in some pedons is due partly to the dark sands.  It is noncalcareous.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AC and upper C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nLower C horizons are commonly present that are slightly or moderately alkaline with 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate."
