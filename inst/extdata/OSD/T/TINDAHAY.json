  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS : The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. Depth to carbonates is 20 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 4 to 10 percent clay and 75 to 90 percent sand.  Horizons 3 to 15 inches thick occur within the upper 10 to 25 inches of the particle-size control section that are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam with clay content of 7 to 18 percent.  Textures below this layer are sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand with 0 to 8 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent fine gravel.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. The dark color in some pedons is due partly to the dark sands.  It is noncalcareous.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AC and upper C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nLower C horizons are commonly present that are slightly or moderately alkaline with 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate."

Fadoll soils have 10 to 20 percent durinodes in Bq horizons and very gravelly textures at depths of 30 to 40 inches.  Feltham soils have horizons below 25 inches with textures finer than loamy fine sand.  Ravana soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F."

Elevations range from about 2,000 to 4,700 feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium or eolian deposits. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including up to 2 feet of snow.  Frost-free period of 100 and 160 days and mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F."
