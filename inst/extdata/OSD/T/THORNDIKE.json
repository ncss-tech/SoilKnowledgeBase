  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 50 cm and corresponds to the depth to bedrock. Rock fragments are dominantly slate, phyllite, or shale and the weighted average ranges from 35 to 80 percent of the mineral soil by volume. Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 3 percent of the surface. The soil is typically silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction, but occasionally there will be coarser textured horizons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, is 15 to 25 cm thick and has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Most undisturbed areas have O horizons that overlie the E horizon, but a few pedons have a 3 to 6 centimeter thick A horizon over the E horizon. Consistence is very friable or friable. The A horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. In some pedons, the texture is very fine sandy loam. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have a Bh horizon has with hue of 2.5 YR to 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 1. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, with value and chroma of 4 to 6. Consistence is very friable or friable. It ranges up to 23 cm thick.\nThe bedrock is generally slate, phyllite, or calcareous metasedimentary rock that is fractured in the upper part."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Canaan and Killington series are members of the same family. Canaan soils range from gravelly fine sandy loam to very gravelly sandy loam throughout. Rock fragments are dominantly granite. Killington soils are derived from gneiss and schist and do not have channery rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thorndike soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of till derived principally from slate, phyllite, or shale. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 910 to 1170 mm. The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 61 to 762 meters above mean sea level."

These soils all are deeper than 50 cm to bedrock, and they all have less than 35 percent by volume of rock fragments and are located on lower positions in the nearby landscape."
