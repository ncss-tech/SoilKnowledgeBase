  "OVERVIEW": "The Tabernash series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified but predominantly fine textured alluvium or lacustrine deposits overlying sand and gravel.  Tabernash soils are on glacial lake and stream terraces or alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 32 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to the contrasting IIC horizon range from 20 to 38 inches.  Rock fragments are less than 25 percent in most of the solum but range from 25 to 70 percent in the IIC horizon.  Rock fragments are mainly pebbles and cobbles.  The solum is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 .\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically clay loam, but clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 50 percent, and sand from 20 to 50 percent.  Transitional B3 horizons less than 5 inches thick are in some pedons.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  It is medium acid through neutral."
