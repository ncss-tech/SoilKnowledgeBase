  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock ranges from 2 to 10 inches.  The estimated mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 72 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry for 6 months or more during most years, mainly during spring, summer, and fall months and are low in organic matter.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 90 percent on the surface and from 35 to 80 percent throughout the profile.  Either gravel or cobbles dominate, but a few stones may also be present.  The pH range is moderately alkaline.  The soil is calcareous throughout and is mainly disseminated.  Lime coatings on rock fragments and in bedrock fractures an also occur.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizons have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  They are gravelly or very cobbly sandy loam or loam.  A Cca horizon is present in deeper profiles but may be lacking in shallower profiles."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from quartzite, gneiss, and schist.  The climate is arid, with an estimated precipitation is from 4 to 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is between 59 and 72 degrees F.; the average January temperature is about 38 to 41 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is about 79 to 85 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 200 to 260 days."
