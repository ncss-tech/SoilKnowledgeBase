These soils are usually dry in all parts of the moisture control section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 30 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 3 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 3 to 10 percent. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay with 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser. Weighted averaged rock fragments in the particle-size control section is 5 to 30 percent. Depth to basalt is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to secondary carbonates is 19 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nThe 2Bt horizon has values of 4 and 5 moist and chroma of 3 and 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist. It contains 0 to 8 percent sand-size ash, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter and averages 5 to 15 percent rock fragments. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It is silt loam or clay loam.\nThe 2Btk horizon has values of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is silt loam, gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam and contains 10 to 60 percent rock fragments. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 2 to 12 percent. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Average January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
