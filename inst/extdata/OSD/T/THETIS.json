  "OVERVIEW": "The Thetis series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loose glacial till with an admixture of volcanic ash. Thetis soils are on mountainsides and in valleys at elevations of 2400 to 4000 feet. Slopes are 25 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 65 to 80 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
