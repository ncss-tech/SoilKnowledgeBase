Except for bulk density, the exchange complex is dominated by amorphous material in the particle-size control section. Solum thickness is 28 to 50 inches.  The spodic horizon thickness is 5 to 10 inches.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 15 to 30 days.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rounded rock fragments of mixed lithology.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid throughout.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1, 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bs horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist, chroma of 2 or 4 moist.\nThe 2Bw and 2BC horizons have a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist chroma of 4 or 6 moist.  They are very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2, 3, or 4 dry and moist.

Crinker, Hatchet, Howson, Klawatti, Polallie, and Springsteen soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Elsnor soils have a solum thickness of 8 to 26 inches and are dry 30 to 45 days in the moisture control section.  Esmeralda soils have 40 to 70 percent diabase, gabbro, and serpentinized basalt rock fragments in the particle-size control section, have a mean annual soil temperature of 40 to 42 degrees F and are dry 30 to 45 days in the moisture control section.  Gilpar soils have 45 to 60 percent angular andesite, basalt and pyroclastic rock fragments in the particle size control section and are dry 30 to 45 days in the moisture control section.  Kachess soils are very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam in the 2Bw horizon, have a massive 3C horizon and are dry 30 to 45 days in the moisture control section.   Lemah soils have a spodic horizon 1 to 3 inches thick and average 35 to 70 percent sandstone fragments in the particle-size control section. Playco soils have a volcanic ash mantle more than 12 inches thick."
