  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 21 to more than 60 inches thick. The combined thickness of the Al and B2t horizon is more than 60 inches. The upper 20 inches of the B2t horizon is 35 to 45 percent clay. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 57 to 59 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but may be dry for less than 60 consecutive days during the later part of the summer. Rock fragments consist of sandstone and quartzite cobbles and gravel; and range from 10 to 15 percent in the Al horizon and 40 to 50 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR value of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry. It ranges from loam in the upper part to loam or light clay loam in the lower part. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral and ranges from 21 to 36 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It ranges from very cobbly clay loam to very gravelly light clay. Structure ranges from weak through strong, medium to coarse subangular blocky. Clay films are common to continuous, thin or moderately thick. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral and extends to depth of more than 60 inches."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite and small amounts of gneiss and schist. The climate is humid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 35 to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 55 to 56 degrees F. and the frost-free period ranges from 30 to 70 days."

Hawkins soils lack argillic horizons, have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section, and crack to the surface in late summer. Ostler soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizons. St. Marys soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick, and lack argillic horizons."
