  "OVERVIEW": "The Trimmer series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, thermic family of Mollic Haploxeralfs. Typically, Trimmer soils have grayish brown, slightly acid, loam A horizons and reddish brown and yellowish red, slightly acid, sandy clay loam B2t horizons that rest on weathered rock at depths of about 31 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 24 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil  temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 degrees to 65 F. The soil temperature does not go below 41 degrees F. and is only occasionally below 47 degrees F. in January.  Soil between the depths of about 5 to 15 inches becomes moist in some or all parts some time in October and remains moist all of the time until some time in May. These soils are dry all the rest of the year. Coarse fragments make up 2 to 20 percent of the solum. Coarse and very coarse sand averages 10 to 20 percent throughout the solum. The soil is neutral to medium acid, but is usually slightly acid and without a clear trend in change with depth.\nThe A horizon is brown or grayish brown and has hue of 10YR or 7.5 YR. It is sandy loam or loam. It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter in the upper 4 inches and less than 1 percent at a depth of 8 inches below the surface. This horizon has weak or moderate structure and in some pedons in massive in some or all parts. The A-B2t horizon boundary is gradual or there are A3 or B1 transitional horizons.  The absolute clay increase from the A horizon to the B2t horizon is about 10 to 17 percent.\nThe B2t horizon is yellowish brown, strong brown, brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4), reddish brown (5YR or yellowish red. It is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay. The lower part of the Bt horizon is sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay in some pedons."

Academy, Burchell, Honn, Jacinto, Los Robles, Marguerite, Modesto, Ojai, Pachappa, Perkins, Pleasanton, and Wyo soils lack a paralithic contact.  Cajalco soils are not clearly differentiated. (See Remarks.) Coarsegold soils have 5 to 10 percent coarse and very coarse sand. Rescue soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 70 inches. Sobrante soils have a lithic contact. Whitney soils have an absolute clay increase from the A horizon to the B2t horizon of 3 to 7 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Trimmer soils formed in residuum weathered from basic and metabasic igneous rocks and are sloping to very steep.  Elevations are 500 to 3,500 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches with little or no snow. The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees to 61 degrees F. The freeze-free season is about 175 to 260 days."

Ahwahnee soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Auberry soils have a base saturation of less than 75 percent in the upper part of the solum. Hambright and Tretten soils have mollic epipedons. Trabuco soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
