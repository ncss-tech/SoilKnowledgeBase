  "OVERVIEW": "The Tsosie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone on alluvial fans on valley sides and stream terraces on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
