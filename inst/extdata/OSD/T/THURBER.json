  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Thurber series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey slope alluvium derived from claystone of Pennsylvanian age. These soils occur on nearly level and very gently sloping toe slopes of ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
