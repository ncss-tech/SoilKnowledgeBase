Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above a depth of 40 inches, and are predominantly less than 1 inch in diameter.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 43 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is typically gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It ranges from gravelly sandy loam through gravelly clay loam."

Auzqui, Tilton and Uhl soils lack cambic horizons. Babb, Bynum, Dewville, Redcloud, and Thayne soils have horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Emerald soils contain rock fragments that are mainly sandstone flagstones more than 10 inches in length.  Also, Emerald soils commonly lack a cambic horizon.  Irondyke soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Tampico soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments, and have mean annual soil temperature of 43 degrees F. or higher.  Teton and Wrenman soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
