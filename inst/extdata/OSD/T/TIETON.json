The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 50 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 95 to 105 consecutive days during summer and autumn.  The particle-size control section has 20 to 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Depth to a lithic contact is more than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist.  It has weak to moderate structure.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4, 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon has weak or moderate blocky or prismatic structure.  The argillic horizon is over 20 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Thin layers of lime are found on boundaries of the horizon and in vertical cracks."

Buckbay, Duzel, Farrot, Hatspring, Immiant, Lobitos, Los Gatos, and Mehlhorn soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Colma soils are medium acid in the B2t horizon.  Facey soils are dry for 90 days during summer and fall and are not influenced by loess.  Foehlin soils are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall.  Jauriga soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Ladd soils have an argillic horizon less than 21 inches thick and a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F.   Morical and Tweedy soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Snowden soils have 15 to 20 percent iron concretions (shot) in the A horizon and have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  Taneum soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 49 degrees F. and are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days."
