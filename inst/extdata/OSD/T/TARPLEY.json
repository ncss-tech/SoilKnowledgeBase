  "OVERVIEW": "The Tarpley series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey residuum over limestone bedrock of the Cretaceous period.  These soils occur on nearly level to strongly sloping upland plateaus and ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in).",
