  "OVERVIEW": "The Teromote series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from shale.  Teromote soils are on knolls, valley and valley sides with slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
