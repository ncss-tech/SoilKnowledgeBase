  "OVERVIEW": "The Trussel series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in medium textured colluvium derived from acid shale, siltstone, and sandstone. They are on foot slopes and drainageways near the tops of mountains. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow to moderately slow in the fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches, mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
