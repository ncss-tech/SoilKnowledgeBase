Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Trussel soils formed in medium textured colluvium from acid shale, siltstone, and sandstone. The climate is humid continental with long winter snow cover.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  Annual frost-free days range between 90 to 130."
