  "OVERVIEW": "The Thermalito series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Thermalito soils are on mounds on intermediate terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, (610 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
