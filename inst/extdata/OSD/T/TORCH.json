  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 30 inches. Depth to the densic contact ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 3 to 7 percent clay. Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the underlying till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the till.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the silty mantle, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy till and in the dense till. Redoximorphic features are within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface in an albic or spodic horizon and aquic conditions occur there at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 to 3\nTexture: a mat of partially decomposed forest litter\nA horizon:\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: silt loam\nCultivated pedons have an Ap horizon:\nHue: of 10YR\nValue of 3 or 4\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: silt loam\nE horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: silt loam\nBs horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR\nValue: 3 or 4\nChroma: 4\nTexture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam\nWhere the silt mantle is thin, some pedons have a 2Bs horizon with colors like the Bs horizon. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nTorch soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and degree to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination. There is not enough clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon in the E/B or B/E horizons. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.80.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizons has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 5. Texture is silt loam.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 (colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more).  The 2Bt part has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described below.\n2Bt horizon:\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs\n3BCd or 3Cd horizon:\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 5\nChroma: 2 to 6\nTexture: Predominantly loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand, but a few pedons have sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam textures\nClay content--2 to 7 percent\nMoist bulk density--1.85 to 2.0 gm/cc"
