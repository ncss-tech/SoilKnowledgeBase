The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon is the illustrative pedon at study area 3a in Gile, L.H., J.W. Hawley and R.B. Grossman.  1981.  The Desert Project Guidebook.  New Mexico Mines & Mineral Resources Memoir 39, Socorro, NM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
