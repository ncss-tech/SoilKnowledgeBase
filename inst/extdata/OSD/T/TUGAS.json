  "OVERVIEW": "The Tugas series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous rocks such as rhyolite, monzonite and andesite.  Tugas soils are on alluvial fans and terraces with slopes of 1 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research."
