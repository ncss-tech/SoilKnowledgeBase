The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series is marginal to a strongly contrasting particle-size class of clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  The 2Btknq horizon is not considered to be part of the natric horizon and is too thick to allow the typical pedon to qualify for a strongly contrasting class.  Future study is needed to determine the amount of volcanic glass influence in the A and Ak horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (A and Ak horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 60 inches at certain times during normal years.\nNatric horizon - The zone from 8 to 21 inches (2Btkn1 and 2Btkn2 horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 21 to 31 inches (2Btknq and 3Bkn horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 21 inches (2Btkn1 and 2Btkn2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
