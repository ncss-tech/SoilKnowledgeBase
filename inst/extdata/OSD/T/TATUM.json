    "content": "REMARKS:\n2006 revisions included minor text cleanup.\nHorizon depths were modified to ensure soil description began at soil surface.  The September 2025 revision corrected some of the formatting. No data was changed.\nTatum soils were formerly mapped in the Carolina Slate Belt.  Data showed that most of these soils had kaolinitic mineralogy.  Tatum soils are now restricted to soils formed from sericite schist, phyllite, or other fine-grained metamorphic rocks. Tarrus soils are now mapped in the Carolina Slate Belt.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 84 centimeters (6 to 33 inches) (Bt horizons).\nParalithic contact--soft weathered bedrock at 112 centimeters (44 inches)"
