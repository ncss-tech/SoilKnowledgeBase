  "OVERVIEW": "The Trackler series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy colluvium and residuum from fine-grained igneous rocks, predominantly rhyolite.  These soils are on mountain ridges, knobs, and benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

Adelphia, Brumbaugh, Cotaco, Delanco, Dillard, Holmdel, Whiteside, and Woodstown soils are deeper than 60 inches to a lithic contact.  In addition, Adelphia and Holmdel soils contain glauconite.  Blairton and Fenwick soils have a lithic contact from 20 to 40 inches.  Cana soils contain small pebbles of glacial origin.  Tuscarawas soils contain channer size shale fragments.  Wharton soils do not have a 2Bt horizon."

The soils formed in loamy materials weathered from acid igneous rocks.  The residuum and most of the colluvium is from rhyolite rocks but some of the materials have deposits from granite rocks.  Soils on summit positions often have a loessial component in their upper profiles.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 40 to 47 inches."

Delassus soils have a fragipan.  Hassler soils formed in residuum from granite.  Knobtop soils are moderately deep and fine-silty.  They are all on similar landscape positions as Trackler.  Irondale, Killarney, and Taumsauk are loamy-skeletal and are on steeper slopes.  Taumsauk soils are shallow and Irondale soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Killarney soils are very deep and well drained.  Skranka soils have more clay, a higher base saturation, and are lower in the landscape.  The well drained Syenite soils are moderately deep to granite bedrock and are on side slopes at lower elevations.  Midco, Secesh, and Relfe are freer drained and are on lower terraces and flood plains."
