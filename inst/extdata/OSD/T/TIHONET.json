  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 0 through 35 percent throughout and typically consist of gravel size granite, gneiss, and schist. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid. Human transported materials range from 0 to 40 centimeters.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 0 through 2. They commonly consist of a thin layer of hemic or sapric material.\nSome pedons have an A, ^A, or ^Ap horizon that has hue 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand through coarse sand or their mucky analogs. The horizon is massive or single grain and consistence is friable through loose. When used for cranberry production, the ^Ap horizon commonly consists of anthropotransported material consisting of a mixture of organic material and sand. Excavated areas that have been abandoned for long periods may develop thin A horizons.\nSome pedons have a Bw or ^Bw horizon that has hue 2.5Y, value 5, and chroma 3 or 4. Texture is sand or loamy fine sand. The horizon is massive or single grain and consistence is friable through loose.\nSome pedons have ^Cg horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma 2. The ^Cg horizon typically has common redoximorphic features. Texture is coarse sand or sand and their gravelly analogs.  The horizon is massive and friable.\nThe 2Cg or 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. The 2C horizon typically has common redoximorphic features. Textures range from loamy fine sand through coarse sand and their gravelly analogs. The horizon is single grain and consistence is friable through loose. Some pedons have fine sandy loam to silt loam textures below 40 inches. Some areas have an iron-rich layer with redder hues that is caused by a fluctuating water table."

Arloval, Carrolls, Conrad, Dair, Forbar, Gothenburg, Norway, Tryon, Tyre, and Wanser soils are from outside of Region R. Arloval soils formed in alluvium and receive less annual precipitation. Barren (T) and Jamaica (T) soils formed in 100 centimeters or more of anthrotransported soil material. Carrolls soils have volcanic ash within the particle size control section. Conrad, Dair, Forbar, and Junius soils have carbonates within a depth of 60 inches. Gothenburg and Norway soils formed in alluvium and are neutral through moderately alkaline. Rhodesfolly (T) soils are subaqueous. Stafford soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and have thicker sola. Tryon soils formed in alluvial and eolian sediments and receive less rainfall. Tyre soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock. Wanser soils are alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tihonet soils are level to nearly level soils on outwash plains. These areas were formerly moderately well to excessively drained soils but have been excavated down to the depth of the water table, primarily for mining sand and gravel and for preparation for cranberry production. The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial materials derived mainly from granite, gneiss, and schist. Some pedons used for cranberry production have anthropotransported soil materials at their surface up to 40 centimeters thick. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 through 1270 millimeters, mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 through 52 degrees F. (7 through 11 degrees C.), and mean growing season ranges from 100 to 195 days."

These are all natural soils that have not been excavated. Carver, Deerfield, Hinckley, Merrimac, and Windsor soils are all better drained. Rainberry, Mashpee, and Massasoit soils have Spodic horizons. Freetown and Swansea soils are organic. Birdsall and Walpole soils have Cambic horizons. Scarboro soils have Histic epipedons. Wareham soils have A horizons that are 15 to 25 centimeters thick."
