These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from various volcanic rocks. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters, and hot, dry summers with occasional rain storms.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 120 to 200 days."
