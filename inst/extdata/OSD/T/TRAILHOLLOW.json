  "OVERVIEW": "The Trailhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Trailhollow soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
