Fren soils contain 15 to 30\npercent ash to a depth of 25 inches and contain secondary\ncarbonates at 20 to 35 inches.  Iver soils contain primarily\nsilty material in the upper part of the particle-size control\nsection and have a lithologic discontinuity at 27 to 38 inches.  Lobert soils typically contain durinodes in the B horizon.  Ola\nsoils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Redmount soils\nlack a cambic B horizon and have a very gravelly 2C horizon at 20\nto 36 inches.  Shively soils are mildly alkaline throughout the profile."
