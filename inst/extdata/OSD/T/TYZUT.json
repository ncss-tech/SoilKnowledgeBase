  "OVERVIEW": "The Tyzut series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium  derived from limestone.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

(R layer)\nThe surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, \"Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979.\"\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nTaxonomic version:  Seventh Edition, 1996.\nThis series was formerly called Tyzak.  The type location for the Tyzak series is being moved to Albany County, Wyoming where a new concept and description is to be developed.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
