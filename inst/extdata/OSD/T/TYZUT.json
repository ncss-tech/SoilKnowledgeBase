(R layer)\nThe surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, \"Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979.\"\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nTaxonomic version:  Seventh Edition, 1996.\nThis series was formerly called Tyzak.  The type location for the Tyzak series is being moved to Albany County, Wyoming where a new concept and description is to be developed.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
