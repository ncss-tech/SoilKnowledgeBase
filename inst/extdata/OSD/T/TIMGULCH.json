Blewett soils have a component of volcanic ash and have 5 to 20 percent soft sandstone fragments.  Fivebit soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Franktown soils have 5 to 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Thirstygulch soils have a Bw horizon and 10 to 20 percent volcanic glass in the A and AB horizons. Wintercanyon soils have a Bw horizon and are strongly to slightly acid in the particle-size control section."
