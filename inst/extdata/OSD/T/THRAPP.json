  "OVERVIEW": "The Thrapp series consists of moderately deep and deep to densic material, moderately well drained soils formed in till and some glaciofluvial material with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on toeslopes and drainage sideslopes of glaciated mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
