  "BYREV": "Rev. AGH; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "11/2018",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tequesta series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils in depressional areas, fresh water swamps and marshes, and broad low flats adjacent to organic soils.  They formed in stratified marine sandy and loamy sediments on the Lower Coastal Plain.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 62 inches.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the Oa and A horizons, and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the B and 2C horizons.\nThe Oa or Oap horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 2.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Where the thickness is more than 6 inches, the value is 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray and brown range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg/Eg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, or olive range from none to common.  The Eg part consists of tongues or tubular intrusions from the Eg horizon; these range from few to common.  Texture of the A part is sand or fine sand.  Texture of the B part is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizon has the same range of colors as the Btg/Eg horizon.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Btg/Eg horizon.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam.  In some pedons, it consists of stratified layers or lenses and streaks of sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 8.  Lenses and pockets of sandy loam or sandy clay loam may occur in some pedons.  In many pedons, all or part of this horizon is a mixture of sand and shell.  Nodules of calcium carbonate range from few to many.  Texture is sand or loamy sand."

They formed in marine sandy and loamy materials under conditions favorable for the accumulation of thin deposits of hydrophytic plant remains.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 58 to 66 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 74 to 76 degrees F."

All of these soils are on similar positions.  EauGallie and Wabasso soils have spodic horizons and do not have histic epipedons.  In addition, Wabasso soils have argillic horizons below the Bh horizon.  Floridana, Jupiter, and Manatee soils are Mollisols.  In addition, Floridana soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness while Jupiter soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  Holopaw soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness and do not have histic epipedons.  Jupiter soils have limestone within a depth of 20 inches.  Okeelanta and Tomoka soils are have organic layers up to 51 inches in depth.  Pineda soils sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  Riviera soils do not have a histic epipedon and are slowly permeable.  Sanibel soils so not have argillic horizons and are sandy throughout.  Winder soils do not have a histic epipedon and have an argillic horizon within a depth of 20 inches."
