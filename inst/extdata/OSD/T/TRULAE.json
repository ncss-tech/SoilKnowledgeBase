It is not below 41 degrees F at any time.  The soil between 6 and 18 inches is moist in all parts from January 1 to May 15 and dry in all parts from July 1 to November 1. Cracks range from 2.5 to 8 cm wide at the surface and 1 to 2 cm at depths of 20 inches from May 15 to November 15 where not irrigated.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 48 to 60 inches in December through March.\nThe A and AC horizons are 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3; or 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/4.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Intersecting slickensides and sphenoids occur throughout the A horizon.  It is noneffervescent to slightly effervescent.\nThe Cn and Ckn horizons are 10YR 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/4, 6/2; or 5Y 4/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4; or 5Y 6/4.  In some horizons there are few to many faint to prominent mottles with colors 7.5YR 4/6; 10YR 4/6; 2.5Y 4/2; 5Y 5/1 or 6/1.  Clay content ranges from 60 to 65 percent in the Cn horizon and 30 to 40 percent in the Ckn horizon.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15.  ESP ranges from 15 to 50.  Intersecting slickensides occur throughout the upper C horizon."

Capay soils have a fine texture control section and are moderately well drained.  Eelpoint soils have a xeric moisture regime and are well drained.  Oswald soils have siltstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Triangle soils are very poorly drained and have a fine texture control section.  Wekoda soils are poorly drained and have a fine texture control section.  Willows soils have color of lower chroma and a fine texture control section."

SAR determined by versinate method.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
