  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches and is less than one-half the thickness of the mollic epipedon.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in most subhorizons of the control section, and there is no subhorizon as much as 3 inches thick above the bedrock that has as much as 15 percent.   Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is usually gravelly loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 52 percent sand with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the control section and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 inch to 19 inches in diameter.  The calcium carbonate equivalent of the whole soil including rock fragments less than 3 inches in diameter ranges from 8 to 39 percent and remains constant or increases with increasing depth. Mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tarryall soils are on moderate to steeply sloping hills and ridges where limestone bedrock lies moderately close to the surface.  The soil formed in parent materials weathered residually from the limestone or locally transported downslope.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is approximately 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer."
