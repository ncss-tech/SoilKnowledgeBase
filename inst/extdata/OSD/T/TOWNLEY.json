  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments, mostly shale or rarely sandstone channers and parachanners, range from 5 to 35 percent in the surface layer and upper part of the solum and from 5 to 95 percent in the lower solum and substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely to strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Ap and AB horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 3 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Eroded horizons are redder with clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay textures.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 4 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has similar textures to the Bt horizon, but it is commonly variegated throughout with lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red.\nThe CB or C horizons, where present, also have similar textures to the Bt horizon; are variegated in shades of gray, brown, red, or yellow; and are commonly made up of mostly relict weathered shale that grades with depth to more consolidated shale strata.\nThe Cr horizon is consolidated shale that can be ripped with heavy machinery."

Albertville, Bonwier, Brockroad, Catharpin, Coghill, Corryton, Cunningham, Cuthbert, Kirvin, Luverne, Masada, Mayodan, McQueen, Peakin, Sweatman, Tatum, Uwharrie, and Vance soils lack paralithic contacts within 40 inches of the soil surface. Badin soils have a lithic contact with 40 inches. Bengal and Carnasaw soils have an irregular boundary between the Bt horizon and the underlying tilted bedrock. Galilee soils lack shale fragments and allow more sand in the Bt horizon. Nason soils are weathered from schist and lack shale fragments in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The regolith is clayey residuum weathered from shale or interbedded sandstone and shale. Average annual air temperature near the type location is 62 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 53 inches."

Hartsells and Linker soils have less than 35 percent clay in their argillic horizons and weathered from sandstone. Hector and Montevallo soils are shallow and lack argillic horizons. Hector soils weathered from sandstone bedrock and Montevallo soils have more than 35 percent shale fragments in the subsoil. Nauvoo soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section and weathered from sandstone bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."
