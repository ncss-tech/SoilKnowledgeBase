  "OVERVIEW": "The Teller series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to sloping soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 953 mm (37 in).",
