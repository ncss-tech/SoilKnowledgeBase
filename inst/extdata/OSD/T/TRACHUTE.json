  "OVERVIEW": "The Trachute series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in mixed eolian and alluvium from sandstone and shale on terraces and benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 6 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Jenrid and Shotnick soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 51 degrees F. and also have precipitation distributed evenly throughout the year and are more moist in May and June. Sodaspring and Toole soils are saline-sodic."
