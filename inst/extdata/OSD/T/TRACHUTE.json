Fang, Geer, Kumiva and Piltdown soils have volcanic ash, glass, or other pyroclastic material in the control section. Jeddito soils have contrasting stratification in the control section. Jenrid and Shotnick soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 51 degrees F. and also have precipitation distributed evenly throughout the year and are more moist in May and June. Sodaspring and Toole soils are saline-sodic."
