  "OVERVIEW": "The Thunderbird series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rock.  Thunderbird soils are on ridges, hills and mesas.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
