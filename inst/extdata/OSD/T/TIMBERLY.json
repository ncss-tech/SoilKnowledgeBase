The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 degrees to 40 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is less than 47 degrees F. Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock commonly is greater than 60 inches.\nd.pth to the IIC2 horizon ranges from 30 to 50 inches. The A and B horizons and the upper part of the C horizon range from fine sandy loam to very fine sandy loam and have 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. The A2 horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 through 5 moist and dry.\nThe IIC2 horizon is loamy sand or sandy loam and has 35 to 70 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Timberly soils are on glaciated peaks in the Cascade Mountains between 5,500 and 6,500 feet elevation. Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent. The soils formed in moderately coarse or medium textured eolian deposits and moderately coarse textured glacial till of andesitic and basaltic origin. The glacial till is less than 2,000 years old and the overlying eolian deposits are younger. Minor amounts of volcanic ash and pumice are incorporated. The climate is humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 120 inches, falling as rain in the early autumn and late spring and snow in the late autumn, winter and early spring. Average annual maximum snow pack ranges from 10 to more than 15 feet. Rainfall amounts are relatively low in the summer. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. The average July temperature is 56 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 33 degrees to 38 degrees F."
