  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Timberly series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits overlying glacial till of andesitic and basaltic origin.  Timberly soils are on glaciated peaks in the Cascade Mountains and have slopes of 5 to 80 percent. The mean precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Timberly soils are on glaciated peaks in the Cascade Mountains between 5,500 and 6,500 feet elevation. Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent. The soils formed in moderately coarse or medium textured eolian deposits and moderately coarse textured glacial till of andesitic and basaltic origin. The glacial till is less than 2,000 years old and the overlying eolian deposits are younger. Minor amounts of volcanic ash and pumice are incorporated. The climate is humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 120 inches, falling as rain in the early autumn and late spring and snow in the late autumn, winter and early spring. Average annual maximum snow pack ranges from 10 to more than 15 feet. Rainfall amounts are relatively low in the summer. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. The average July temperature is 56 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 33 degrees to 38 degrees F."
