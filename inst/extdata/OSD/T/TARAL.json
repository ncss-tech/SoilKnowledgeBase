  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 15 to 38 inches.  The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay, less than 35 percent rock fragments, and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Colors occur in horizontal or convoluted streaks and patches due to frost churning.  Texture is silt, mucky silt loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 3, 4, or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent subangular gravel and 0 to 15 percent subangular cobble.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Aycab soils have a paralithic contact within 20 to 40 inches.  Coutis, Earcree, Hailman, Naz, and Tosp soils have MAST greater than 35 degrees F.  Foxvire and Moonlight soils have cambic horizons.  Gardners Fork soils have 20 to 35 percent shale fragments in the control section.  Razorba soils are calcareous throughout.  Shook and Skyway soils have a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches."

Slopes range from 20 to 45 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Strelna and Nerelna series on the same landforms.  Strelna soils are the permafrost counterpart of the Taral series.  The organic mat of the Strelna soils is undisturbed, resulting in better insulation, lower soil temperature, and permafrost within the control section. Nerelna soils are silty throughout the profile."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Taral soils have native vegetation of white spruce, quaking aspen, paper birch, and willows.  Most areas have been burned, resulting in the transition from Strelna to Taral soils.  The successional state of vegetation in a given area is closely related to the fire history."
