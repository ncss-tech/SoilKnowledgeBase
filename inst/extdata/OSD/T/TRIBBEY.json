  "OVERVIEW": "The Tribbey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on narrow flood plains in river valleys in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 889 mm (35 in).",
