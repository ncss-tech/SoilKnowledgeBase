Depth to indurated rhyolite bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and\nchroma of 2 or 3.  It is stony silt loam or stony loam.  Content\nof coarse fragments make up 25 to 50 percent by volume.  About 15\nto 25 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter, and 10 to\n25 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma\nof 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly loam,\ncobbly silt loam, or cobbly loam.  Content of coarse fragments\nmake up 35 to 65 percent by volume.  About 35 to 50 percent by\nvolume is less than 76 mm in diameter, and 0 to 15 percent by\nvolume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma\nof 3 to 6.  It is very gravelly loam.  Content of coarse fragments make up 70 to 80 percent by volume and are less than 76 mm in diameter.  Reaction is slightly acid.\nThe R layer is indurated rhyolite that is tilted more than 20\ndegrees from horizontal."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brewster, Eckert, Kiti,\nLampshire, and Palopinto series in the same family and the Aledo, Atascosa, Eckrant, Shidler, Woodford, and Yates series of similar families.  Brewster, Eckert, Lampshire, and Palopinto soils lack B horizons and are dry for longer periods of time.  In addition, Eckert, Kiti, and Palopinto soils are more alkaline in reaction.  Also, Kiti soils formed over tilted limestone.  Aledo soils have carbonatic mineralogy and are more alkaline in reaction.  Atascosa soils have an argillic horizon.  Eckrant soils have more than 35 percent clay content in the control section.  Shidler soils have\nless than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Woodford soils have\nsiliceous mineralogy and formed over tilted sandstone.  Yates\nsoils lack a mollic epipedon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Timhill soils are on the highest parts of the Arbuckle Mountains.  They are on the sloping tops and the strongly sloping to steep shoulder and back slopes.  The soil formed in material weathered from tilted rhyolite of Cambrian age.  Slopes\nare 5 to 30 percent.  The climate is subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation is 36 to 38 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range\nfrom 46 to 62."
