The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages between 35 and 85 percent coarse fragments and has free carbonates in the lower part.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.  Gravel content ranges from 30 to 55 percent, cobbles from 5 to 15 percent, and stones from 0 to 20 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, and strongly or violently effervescent."
