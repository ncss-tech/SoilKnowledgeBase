    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Crocamp series. The Crocamp soil is formed in colluvium and is 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact.  The Dollarlake, Fruitcreek, Granitemountain and Leespeak soils are similar.  The similar soils are isotic.  In addition, Fruitcreek and Leespeak soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Granitemountain soils have 4 to 8 percent clay. Dollarlake soils have higher base saturation (eutric)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toats soils are on open backslopes of mountains usually with southerly aspects. Elevations are 4,600 to 5,500 feet. Slopes are 15 to 35 percent. These soils formed in glacial till with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F. The average annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."

Burget soils are on shoulders, and ridges and are shallow to a paralithic contact. Crocamp soils are on backslopes and shoulders and are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock. Longswamp soils are moderately well drained soils with a mollic epipedon on footslopes and drainage sideslopes. Myerscreek soils are formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick. Sitdown soils are formed in sandy-skeletal outwash or till with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick."
