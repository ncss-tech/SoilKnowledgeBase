  "OVERVIEW": "The Toats series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till from granitic and metamorphic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on open backslopes of mountains usually with southerly aspects. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F. The average annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F.

Longswamp soils are moderately well drained soils with a mollic epipedon on footslopes and drainage sideslopes. Myerscreek soils are formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick. Sitdown soils are formed in sandy-skeletal outwash or till with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick."
