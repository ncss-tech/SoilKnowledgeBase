  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (Ap and A horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 9 to 20 inches (Bw horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 20 to 36 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons and parts of the Bw and C horizons).\nThis revision of April 2005 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Sodic Xeric Haplocalcids based on vegetative production and correlation to an Upland rangeland ecological site for most acres of Thiokol.  More measurements of sodium levels are needed to determine whether the Sodic subgroup classification is warranted for most acreage of Thiokol.  Low rainfall phases of Thiokol and phases of Thiokol in Idaho will be correlated to a series with an aridic moisture regime.\nThe active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data.\nIn Utah some phases of this series are correlated with Semidesert range sites.\nIn future correlations, areas currently mapped Thiokol that are in nonirrigated cropland will be correlated as Sodic Calcixerepts.\nIn August 1994 the classification was changed from Xerollic Calciorthids to Sodic Xeric Haplocalcids.  This incorporated the sodic feature and updated the series according to the Aridisol amendment.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 216-217, Table 9 of the Soil Survey of Box Elder County, Utah, Eastern Part.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
