  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 68 F. These soils are usually dry for 6 months or more during most years, mainly during the spring to autumn. The fine earth fraction contains 60 to 90 percent quartz or other forms of soils. The soil is lithochromic with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6. The calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15 percent and any one horizon has less than 5 percent secondary carbonates. Very fine to medium gypsum or lime segregations are below 20 inches in some pedons in virgin areas. The A1 horizon has 0,2 to 0.75 percent organic matter. The control section is dominantly fine sand or sand but can be stratified with thin strata up to 6 inches thick of loamy fine sand or loamy sand. Gravelly strata are in some pedons with the gravel ranging up to 1/2 inch in size and to 30 percent by volume. The gravel content in the control section average less than 15 percent.\nCompeting Series and their Differentiae: These are the Bluepoint, Brazito, Maynard Lake, Moapa Pintura, and Yturbide series. Bluepoint soils have loamy fine sand or loamy sand control section with more than 10 percent silt plus clay. Maynard Lake soils have loamy sand control sections with more than 20 percent volcanic ash, glass or other pyroclastic materials, Moapa soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Pintura soils are noncalcareous. Yturbide soils have control sections with more than 10 percent silt plus clay and 15 to 35 percent gravel.\nSetting: Toquop soils are on smooth, nearly level broad terraces adjacent to perennial stream and slightly convex nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans at elevations of 1,400 to 400O feet. Slope gradients range from O to 4 percent. These soils formed in very deep sandy alluvium derived primarily from unconsolidated calcareous sandy Tertiary basin fill material, or weakly consolidated. sandstone of older geologic age, with minor admixtures of limestone. The climate is arid with hot summers and mild winters. The mean annual precipitation is between 5 and 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 66 F.  The average monthly temperature ranges from 42 to 45 F.\nin January and from 81 to 83 F. in July, and the growing season ranges from about 220 to 270 days.\nPrincipal Associated Soils: These are the Baseline, Black Butte, Calico, Mormon Mesa, and Overton soils. Baseline soils have sandy over fine textured control sections. Black Butte soils have fine loamy over sandy textured control sections. Calico soils have coarse loamy over fine textured control sections. Mormon Mesa soils have dense, very thick, indurated lime hardpans. Overton soils have fine textured control sections.\nDrainage and Permeability: Excessively drained; very slow runoff; very rapid permeability. A temporary water table occurs in small areas where the soils are subject to seepage from adjacent irrigated lands or irrigated canals. Under natural conditions the water table is estimated to be at depths greater than 20 feet.\nUse and Vegetation: Where water is available for irrigation much of the soil is cultivated to alfalfa and assorted vegetable row crops.  Nonirrigated areas of these soils are used for grazlng The vegetation is principally honey mesquite, creosoteDush, Indian ricegrass, and assorted annuals.\nDistribution and Extent: Along the Virgin River and its tributaries in Nevada, Arizona, and Utah and along other streams in central Arizona.  The series is of moderate extent.\nSeries Established: Beaver Creek Area, Arizona, 1965.\nRemarks: Toquop soils were classified as Regosols. Brazito and Toquop soils appear to overlap in their range in characteristics in several properties. Further studies are needed to confirm differentiating criteria.\nOSED scanned by NSSQA.  Last revised by state on 9/73.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
