  "OVERVIEW": "The Tamalco series consists of moderately well drained soil on till plains. These very deep soils are very shallow to moderately deep to sodium. They formed in loess, or in loess and mixed loess and drift, that overlies a paleosol. These soils contain 15 percent or more exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1,016 mm (40 inches).",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tamalco soils are on convex summits and sideslopes of ridges and on sideslopes of drainageways on the loess-covered till plains of the Illinois episode. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Tamalco soils typically formed in loess. Some pedons formed in loess and the underlying mixed loess and drift. Tamalco soils are underlain, at a depth of 1.0 to 2.0 meters (3.5 to 6.5 feet), by the Farmdale Geosol. The Farmdale soil is underlain by the Sangamon Geosol at depths greater than 200 cm (80 inches). The paleosol may or may not have been truncated by erosion prior to loess deposition. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1,067 mm (36 to 42 inches), frost-free period is 180 to 200 days, and elevation is 137 meters (450 feet) to 229 meters (750 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Darmstadt soils are on talfs, lower broad convex summits, or on similar sideslopes nearby. The somewhat poorly drained Hoyleton and Oconee soils are on talfs, or lower summits, and do not have natric horizons. The moderately well drained Richview soils do not have a natric horizon and are on slightly higher summits nearby."
