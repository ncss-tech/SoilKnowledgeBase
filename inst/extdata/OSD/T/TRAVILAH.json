  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 21 to 39 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Partially weathered serpentine channers range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon and up to 30 percent in the B and C horizons.  Few boulders are present in some pedons.  Reaction is medium acid to mildly alkaline in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Thin A1 horizons, where present, have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  They are silt loam or loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have hue of 2.5Y in the lower B horizon.  The B horizons are silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, is commonly multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, green, and black.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Travilah soils are on the northern portions of the Piedmont Plateau uplands, commonly associated with diabase and/or schist.  These soils are on broad convex ridges; slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  They have developed in residuum weathered from serpentine.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 51 to 57 degrees F."
