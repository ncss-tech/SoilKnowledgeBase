  "OVERVIEW": "The Tustell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Tustell soils are on fan piedmont remnants and partial ballenas.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
