  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tarquin soils occur on dissected fan remnants and side slopes of hills. Slopes are 9 to 30 percent. Elevations are 50 to 198 meters (160 to 645 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone and conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1900 to 2290 millimeters (75 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 275 to 325 days."
