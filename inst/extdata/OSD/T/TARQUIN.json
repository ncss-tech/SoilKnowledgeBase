  "OVERVIEW": "The Tarquin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed  colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone and conglomerate. Tarquin soils are on dissected fan remnants and hills and have slopes of 9 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
