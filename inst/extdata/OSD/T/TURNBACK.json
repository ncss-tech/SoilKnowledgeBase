  "OVERVIEW": "The Turnback series consists of moderately deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium, residuum, and eolian deposits derived dominantly from sandstone.  Turnback soils are on hillslopes and summits.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   These soils typically effervesce throughout the profile but may be leached as much as 8 inches in some pedons.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw cambic horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Clay ranges from 5 to 15 percent with total fines greater than 15 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos.  Some pedons have few gypsum crystals in the lower part of this horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry,  4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Clay ranges from 5 to 15 percent with more than 15 percent total fines.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos.  Carbonates range from 4 to 8 percent but do not qualify for a calcic.  Some pedons have secondary accumulations of gypsum.\nThe Cr or material at the paralithic control is soft, calcareous sandstone.  Some discontinuous horizons of hard sandstone may occur beneath some pedons."
