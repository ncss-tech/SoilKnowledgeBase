  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 70 percent.  When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks remain open from 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and wedge-shaped peds begin at a depth of 10 to 25 inches.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with  microknolls about 2 to 10 inches above the microdepressions.  Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdpression ranges from 3 to 10 feet.  Colors with chroma of 2 or less in the subsoil are considered to be litho-chromic.  Mottles with chroma of 3 or more, or redox concentrations, are considered to be relic or litho-chromic.\nThe A horizon has colors of brown or gray in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral with values of 2 through 4, chroma of 1 to 3.  More than half of the pedon has a value of 3 or more within 7 inches.  The texture is silty clay or clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss and Bkss horizons are in hues of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, values of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 and 3.  Mottles in shades of brown and gray range from none to common.  Few to common masses and pitted concretions of calcium carbonate are in most pedons. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizons range from clay to weakly tuffaceous siltstone and mudstone.  Colors are olive, yellow or brown and in hues 2.5Y and 5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 2 and 3 with few to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and olive.  Masses and pitted concretions of calcium carbonate range from none to few.  Masses of gypsum crystals range from none to few. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  The C horizon commonly contains less calcium carbonate with increasing depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burkeville and Redco series in the same family.  Similar soils are Raylake, and Wiergate.  Burkeville and Wiergate soils are very deep and have colors in hues of 10YR, to 5Y.  Raylake soils are more acid and lack carbonates.  Redco soils are very deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tahoula soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in weakly consolidated calcareous tuffaceous sediments mainly of the Catahoula geologic formation.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 46 to 56 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 70 degrees F.   Frost free days range from 235 to 260.  Elevation ranges from 350 to 550 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."

Browndell, Corrigan, and Rayburn soils are on nearly level to steep uplands and have argillic horizons.  In addition, Browndell soils have a solum ranging from 10 to 20 inches thick.  Corrigan soils are dominated by gray in the upper part.  Rayburn soils are dominated by red in the upper part."
