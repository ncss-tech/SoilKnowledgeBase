Bogart soils have rock fragments dominantly of sandstone, shale, and quartz. Centerburg, Cygnet, Houcktown, Jenera, Tuscola, Vallonia, Vanlue, and Williamstown soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. In addition, Cygnet and Houcktown soils have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section. Haney soils have more than 2 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Jugtown, Nicely, Scattersville, and Swampoodle soils do not have carbonates within 140 cm (55 inches). Reaville soils have bedrock within 102 cm (40 inches)."
