  "OVERVIEW": "The Timbercrater series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in ash fall deposits of pumice and ash.  Timbercrater soils are on ridges, mountain flanks and mountain tops and have slopes of 0 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 14 to 25 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum has andic soil properties throughout and have 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass, 1.0 to 2.5 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 50 to 85 percent phosphate retention, 3 to 12 percent 15-bar air-dry moisture content and 4 to 13 percent moist 15-bar water content.  The weighted average of 8xSi+Fe is 5 to 8.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent pumice fragments.\nSome pedons lack an A horizon and have an albic horizon (E) up to 3 inches thick; when this occurs slopes are typically less than 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam and it contains 15 to 35 percent pumice paragravel and 0 to 10 percent andesite gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 60 percent pumice paragravel.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry.  It is ashy sand, ashy loamy sand, or pumice and contains 70 to 95 percent pumice paragravel."

If this property is not present, runoff, depending on slope, may be low.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL S00OR-035-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
