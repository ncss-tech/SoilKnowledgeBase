  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 14 to 25 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum has andic soil properties throughout and have 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass, 1.0 to 2.5 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 50 to 85 percent phosphate retention, 3 to 12 percent 15-bar air-dry moisture content and 4 to 13 percent moist 15-bar water content.  The weighted average of 8xSi+Fe is 5 to 8.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent pumice fragments.\nSome pedons lack an A horizon and have an albic horizon (E) up to 3 inches thick; when this occurs slopes are typically less than 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam and it contains 15 to 35 percent pumice paragravel and 0 to 10 percent andesite gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 60 percent pumice paragravel.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry.  It is ashy sand, ashy loamy sand, or pumice and contains 70 to 95 percent pumice paragravel."

The soils formed in ash fall deposits of pumice and ash from Mt. Mazama.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F and the frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAndic soil properties - from 2 to 16 inches\nOchric epipedon\nAshy-pumiceous - the profile contains greater than 65 percent pumice fragments\nVitri (greatgroup) - the solum averages 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass and has an air-dry 15-bar moisture content of 3 to 12 percent\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and features found in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nRunoff is moderate due to the hydrophobic nature of the surface horizon.  If this property is not present, runoff, depending on slope, may be low.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL S00OR-035-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
