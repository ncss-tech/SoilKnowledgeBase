  "OVERVIEW": "The Truhoy series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Truhoy soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
