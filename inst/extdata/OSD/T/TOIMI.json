Rock fragment content averages less than 35 percent, by volume, in the particle size control section.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon (duff layer).\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is stony loam, stony fine sandy loam, stony sandy loam, or their non-stony, gravelly or cobbly analogues. Rock fragment content by volume ranges from 2 to 30 percent with 2 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones and boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon up to 8 cm thick but this occurs in less than 50 percent of all pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or their stony, cobbly or gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content by volume ranges from 2 to 30 percent with 2 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones and boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC or 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2BCd horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand or gravelly coarse sandy loam or their very gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content by volume ranges from 15 to 45 percent with 15 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 2 percent stones and boulders.  The moist 1/3 bar bulk density of the fine earth fraction is from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cm3. It is moderately acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Greysolon, Normanna, Soudan and Wahlsten series. The Greysolon and Wahlsten soils have bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 cm.  The Normanna soils formed in Superior Lobe till with substratum colors having hue of 5YR. Soudan soils have dense till with greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section and have sandy textures in the middle third of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on convex ridgetops and back slopes of drumlins and moraines. Slopes typically are 5 to 18 percent, but range from 1 to 45 percent. They formed in a coarse loamy mantle and the underlying dense coarse loamy basal Rainy Lobe till of Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 mm. Annual frost free days range from 90 to 120 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 200 to 600 meters."

The somewhat poorly drained Brimson soils are on plane to slightly convex slopes, typically below the Toimi soils. The very poorly drained Bugcreek soils are on toeslopes or in drainageways and depressions.  The poorly drained Nevens soils are on plane to slightly concave summits and footslopes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second (0.20 to 2.0 inches per hour) in the upper part and .01 to .42 micrometers per second (0.0015 to 0.06 inches per hour) in the lower part.  The Toimi soils have a perched seasonal high saturation as high as 46 cm below the surface in spring in normal years. After rainfall events, a higher water table may be perched for brief periods of time. At the contact between the mantle and the dense till there is commonly a concentration of redoximorphic features that has a shallow penetration into the dense till along fractures and rock sockets."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 cm below the surface (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 89 cm (Bw horizons); oxyaquic subgroup based on saturation within 102 cm of the surface; isotic mineralogy based on lab data from the NSSL.\nThe previous classification of this soil was coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Dystrochrepts.\nThe designation of the 2BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to NSSL pedon number 95MN-137-541 for additional analysis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
