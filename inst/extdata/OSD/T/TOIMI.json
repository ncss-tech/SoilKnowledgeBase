Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 mm. Annual frost free days range from 90 to 120 days.

The Toimi soils have a perched seasonal high saturation as high as 46 cm below the surface in spring in normal years. After rainfall events, a higher water table may be perched for brief periods of time. At the contact between the mantle and the dense till there is commonly a concentration of redoximorphic features that has a shallow penetration into the dense till along fractures and rock sockets."

Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart."
