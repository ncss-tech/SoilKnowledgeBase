  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is over 60 inches.  The soil is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizons have colors in hues of 10YR or 7.5 YR, values of 3, and chromas of 2 to 4 inclusive.  They range from sand to sandy loam inclusive.  Black concretions in these horizons have matrix colors in hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, values of 4 through 6, and chromas of 6 through 8.  Mottles range from few to common, from fine to medium, and are red or dark red.\nGray mottles are usually in the lower B horizon.  The B horizons are dominantly clay.  Structure is moderate or strong subangular blocky and clay films are thin patchy or thin continuous."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aceitunas, Guanajibo, Guerrero, Jobos, Vega Alta, and Yunque series.  The Aceitunas soils lack plinthite.  The Guanajibo, Guerrero, Jobos, and Vega Alta soils have lower organic matter content in the upper B horizon.  The Guanajibo, Jobos, and Vega Alta soils have thinner B horizons.  The Yunque soils lack plinthite and have yellowish brown upper B colors and hues become redder with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Torres soils occur in gently sloping coastal plains and trapped valleys among the haystack hills, on slope gradients of 2 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in iron rich, fine textured sediments overlain by coarser textured sediments high in quartz grains.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation varies from 60 to 80 inches and the mean annual temperature from 76 to 79 degrees F."

The Almirante soils lack the thick, dark sandy A horizons.  The Bayamon and Matanzas soils have redder colors throughout and lower cation exchange capacity and lack the thick sandy surface layers."
