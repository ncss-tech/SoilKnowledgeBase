  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lesliecreek(AZ) and Sprone (TX) series. Lesliecreek soils are more moist with mean annual precipitation of 16 to 20 inches. Sprone soils formed in loamy alluvial sediments derived mainly from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age and Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age and are on the Southern High Plains (MLRA 77) and are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Toyah soils are on nearly level flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slope gradients are mostly less than 1 percent but some are as much as about 2 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous loamy alluvium derived from soils formed in limestone, sandstone, and volcanic rocks.  The climate is arid to semiarid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 65 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240 and elevation ranges from 2,450 to 3,000 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dalby, Hoban, Patrole, Pima and Verhalen series.  Dalby and Verhalen soils have intersecting slickensides, and cracks that are 0.4 or more inches wide that extend to 30 inches or more and remain open most of the year.  They are in playas and upland depressions. Hoban soils have ochric epipedons, and a regular decrease in organic matter and are on higher upland positions.  Patrole soils have ochric epipedons, and fine-silty over clayey 10 to 40 inch control sections and are on similar positions."
