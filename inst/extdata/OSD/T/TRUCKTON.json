  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Truckton soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches.  Base saturation typically is more than 80 percent and ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above depth of 50 inches and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter. Within the sand fraction a high percentage is medium and coarser angular sand which has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  The soils range from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 70 degrees  F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically coarse sandy loam and has 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand.  Loamy sand or coarser soils are excluded from the above range.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Eastonville, Julesburg, Manter, Mawer, and Torrington series.  Eastonville soils have noncontrasting loamy coarse sand or coarse sand C horizons.  Julesburg soils have loamy sand or sand C horizons, have only small amounts of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand, and lack the hard setting characteristics of the Truckton soils.  Manter soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Mawer soils have noncontrasting sandy-skeletal substrata.  Torrington soils overlie soft bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Truckton soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping fans, terraces, valley side slopes, hills and ridges.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 or more percent.  The soils formed in locally transported parent materials derived from arkose beds.  In some pedons the parent arkose beds are shallower than 40 inches but are of such low contrast that they cannot be consistently identified.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bresser and Bijou soils.   Bresser soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons.  Bijou soils lack mollic epipedons.  Truckton soils occur in some landscapes in a topographic sequence with the Blakeland and Besser soils."
