  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuntsa series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt and sandstone.  Tuntsa soils are on fan terraces, and on toeslopes and footslopes of stable landslides, and have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
