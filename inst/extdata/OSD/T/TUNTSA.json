Breece soils contain gravelly horizons with fragments of granite, and are moist during May and June. Breeton soils are moist during May and June. Coberly soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Dotsero, Hedoes and Parshall soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations. Klizhin soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section less than 60 percent of the time that the soil is above 41 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches and mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.  Ruso soils have stratified sand and gravel within 40 inches."

Tuntsa soils formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary basalt and sandstone. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 7,600 to 8,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
