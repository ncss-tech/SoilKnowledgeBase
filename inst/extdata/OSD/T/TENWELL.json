  "REVDATE": "12/2015",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenwell series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. The Tenwell soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
