  "OVERVIEW": "The Tallcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, lake terraces, outwash terraces and lake plains in valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
