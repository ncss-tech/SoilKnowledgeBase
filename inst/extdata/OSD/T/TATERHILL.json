    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cottonbend, Egyptgrove, Fanchon, McClung, Nolichucky, Trimble, and Wyrick series. Cottonbend, McClung, and Trimble soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Egyptgrove soils have a Btd horizon. Fanchon soils have a 3Bt horizon. Nolichucky soils have rounded sandstone and quartzite fragments. Wyrick soils typically have fewer rock fragments in the 2Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Taterhill soils are typically on foot slopes and occasionally on high strath terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium derived mainly from loess and the underlying valley fill materials. Elevations are commonly 850 to 1,150 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Poynor soils have a loamy-skeletal over clayey particle-size class and are on side slopes. Scholten and Tonti soils have fragipans. Scholten soils are on side slopes and have a loamy-skeletal particle size class. Tonti soils are on ridge tops."
