  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Taterhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands. They formed in slope alluvium derived mainly from loess and the underlying valley fill materials. These soils are on gently to moderately sloping foot slopes and high strath terraces in MLRA 116A. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
