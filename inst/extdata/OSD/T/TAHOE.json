The soils have an aquic moisture regime.\nWater features:\nSeasonal high water table:  0 to 25 cm.\nFlooding: Frequent\nPonding: Frequent\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral\nBase saturation: Is very low (less than 10) when the influence of the andesitic lahar is strong and as high as 60 in the lower horizons when the influence of the granodiorite is stronger.  The A horizons have a base saturation of less than 50 percent.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tahoe soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. The headwaters of these areas are predominantly granodiorite and andesitic lahar. Elevation is 1888 to 2431 meters. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 483 to 1700 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C. The frost free season is 20 to 60 days. Snotel data has shown that some of these areas are subject to cold air drainage."
