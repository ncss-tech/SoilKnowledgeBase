  "OVERVIEW": "The Tidings series consists of deep well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  These soils formed in materials weathered from sandstone containing strata of siltstone and shale.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches.",
