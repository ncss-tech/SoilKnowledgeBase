  "OVERVIEW": "The Threek series consists of very deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from volcanoclastic material.  Threek soils are on sideslopes and summits of glacial valley trains and outwash terraces. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
