  "OVERVIEW": "The Tripoli series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 30 to 70 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying till. Tripoli soils are on nearly level or slightly concave positions on dissected till plains of low relief on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
