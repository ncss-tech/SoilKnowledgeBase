    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is 40 to 72 inches. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 80 inches. Thickness of the loess mantle is 24 to 40 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the A, Ap, and Bt horizon, from 0 to 20 percent in the 2Bt and 2BC horizon, and 0 to 30 percent in the 2C horizon.\nThe upper part of the control section (A or Ap horizons) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick that has a value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam with 12 to 25 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand.\nThe second part of the control section (BE horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam.\nThe third part of the control section (Bt horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam, with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand.\nThe fourth part of the control section (2Bt horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are few to many. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and their channery analogues. It has 30 to 55 percent clay and less than 20 percent sand.\nThe lower part of the control section (2BC and 2C horizons) have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. They are silty clay loam, silty clay, and their channery or gravelly analogues. They have 27 to 45 percent clay and less than 20 percent sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashburn, Blocher, Deuchars, Gallipolis, Jeneva, Percell, and Stonehead series. Ashburn soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Blocher soils have free carbonates in the control section. Gallipolis soils are on stream terraces and do not have residual materials in the control section. Jeneva soils formed in loess, a thin layer of pedisediment, and a paleosol on Illinoin till plains. Percell soils formed in 45 to 70 inches of loess, and the underlying lacustrine sediments. Stonehead soils have less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tarhollow soils are on unglaciated uplands on the Allegheny Plateau. They formed in a mantle of loess 24 to 40 inches thick and in the underlying residuum weathered from siltstone, shale, or limestone. Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches."

The moderately well drained Aaron soils are on ridgetops and have thinner loess mantles. The well drained Gilpin and Westmoreland soils are on summits and steep sideslopes and have a thinner loess mantle. The moderately well drained Keene soils and the well drained Wellston soils are underlain by sandstone and siltstone on summits. The well drained Westmore soils are on similar landscape positions."

Permeability is moderate to moderately slow in the loess mantle and moderately slow to slow in the residuum. An intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet from December to April."
