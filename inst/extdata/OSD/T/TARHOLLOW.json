  "OVERVIEW": "The Tarhollow series consist of deep or very deep, moderately well drained soils on unglaciated uplands. These soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum of siltstone or shale on uplands. The thickness of the loess mantle is 24 to 40 inches thick. Permeability is moderately slow to moderate in the silty material and moderately slow to slow in the underlying material. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
