  "BYREV": "Rev. TEF-LDC-RJB",
  "REVDATE": "06/2015",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Taintor series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on crests of interfluves on dissected till plains and treads on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C (51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters (37 inches).",
