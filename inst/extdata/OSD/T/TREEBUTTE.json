  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the solum and volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 10 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 60 to 75 percent rock fragments and 2 to 6 percent clay.  Depth to the lithic contact is 14 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid throughout.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5  moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.  The texture is extremely stony coarse sandy loam, extremely stony sandy loam, or very stony sandy loam.  It has 20 to 30 percent gravel, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 25 to 35 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Treebutte soils are on shoulders and broad ridges of mountains at elevations of 4,800 to 7,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic and metamorphic rock with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  The average annual temperature ranges from 35 to 40 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges from 60 to 90 days."
