  "OVERVIEW": "The Toags series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous rocks. The Toags soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).",
