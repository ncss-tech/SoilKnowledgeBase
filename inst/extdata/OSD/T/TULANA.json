  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F.; and the mean January soil temperature is about 28 degrees F.  The soils are ponded under natural conditions.  The upper part of the soil is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and the lower part is mildly alkaline to extremely acid.  Ranges in soil reaction are reflective of drained and undrained conditions.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 23 inches thick.  Bulk density at 1/3 bar water retention ranges from about 0.40 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter throughout the soil.  The soils have high amounts of diatoms, sponge spicules, and amorphous materials.  Mucky layers 4 to 10 inches thick are common at depths below 20 inches.  Pumiceous ash layers 1 to 6 inches thick are common at depths below 35 inches. The organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.  A silty light gray volcanic ash layer 6 to 27 inches thick is immediately under the mollic epipedon, but is less than 14 inches cumulative inches thick within 24 inches of the surface.  The particle-size control section has less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material and 10 to 30 percent clay with the weighted average being over 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and 0 to 2 dry. The 15 bar water is about 45 to 65 percent.  Organic matter is 10 to 20 percent.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is 50 to 85 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 7 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.  It is silt, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  The C horizon below depth of 35 inches is stratified silt loam to fine sand. Base saturation (sum of cations) is 30 to 45 percent."

The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches.  The mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.
