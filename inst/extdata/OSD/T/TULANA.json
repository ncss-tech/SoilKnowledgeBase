Former classification: medial, nonacid, mesic Mollic Andaquepts.\n3/2003: The superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document was not updated.\n4/2022: Updated the soil textures with diatomaceous modifiers for all silty textures. Added an ashy modifier to the C1 horizon.\nFurther investigation is needed to confirm fine-silty (vs. coarse silty) particle-size class, and to confirm that Aquandic subgroup criteria are met; lab data from other Tulana pedons are inconclusive with regard to Aquandic subgroup criteria."
