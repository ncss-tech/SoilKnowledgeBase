  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thompsonville soils are on outwash terraces, outwash plains, and glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits and the underlying loamy materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F). Frost-free period is 110 to 120 days. Elevation is 183 to 366 meters (600 to 1,200 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained or very poorly drained Dair soils, the somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils, the moderately well drained Covert soils, and the excessively drained Kaleva and Grattan soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the soil is sandy throughout. The somewhat poorly drained Milnichol soils form a drainage sequence with Thompsonville soils."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 102 cm (18 to 40 inches) for 30 or more days between October and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately low in the loamy material. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and slow in the loamy material."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in woodland. Mature forests are mostly red maple, northern red oak, paper birch, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and red pine. Balsam fir and quaking aspen are in most stands. Some areas are used for cropland and pastureland. Corn, small grains, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas formerly used as cropland are now idle or planted to pine trees."
