  "OVERVIEW": "The Thompsonville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits over stratified silty and loamy materials. These soils are on outwash terraces, outwash plains and glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Balsam fir and quaking aspen are in most stands. Some areas are used for cropland and pastureland. Corn, small grains, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas formerly used as cropland are now idle or planted to pine trees."
