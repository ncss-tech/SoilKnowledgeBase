The soil reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless the surface has been limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy sand or their mucky analogues.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles are in shades of brown or yellow.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles are in shades of yellow or brown.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe Cg horizon has colors of the BCg horizon and in addition, has hue of 5GY or 5G, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or sandy loam."

Arapahoe, Johnston, Mullica, Pickney, Pocomoke, Portsmouth, Rutlege, Weeksville, and Weston series are in closely related families.  Arapahoe and Mullica have mixed mineralogy.  Arapahoe is also nonacid.  Johnston and Pickney soils have an umbric epipedon more than 24 inches thick.  Pocomoke, Portsmouth, and Weston soils have argillic horizons.  Rutlege soils are sandy throughout.  Weeksville soils are coarse-silty."
