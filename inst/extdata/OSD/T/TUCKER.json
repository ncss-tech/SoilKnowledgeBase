  "OVERVIEW": "The Tucker series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in recent alluvium from welded tuff and basalt.  They are on alluvial terraces and flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
