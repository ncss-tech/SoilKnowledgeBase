  "OVERVIEW": "The Tantalus series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash and cinders.  Tantalus soils are on uplands and have slopes of 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 100 inches and mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F.",
