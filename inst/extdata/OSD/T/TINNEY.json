Amarose soils have series control sections that range to neutral and have hue of 2.5YR.  It also has Btk horizon with 25 to 40 percent clay.  The base of the argillic horizon is greater than 60 inches.  Berino soils do not have cambic horizons.  Grizzle soils are moderately deep to sandstone.  Gulch soils have accumulations of gypsum in the profile.  Headquarters soils have calcic horizons within 20 inches of the surface.  McNeal soils have calcic horizons within 20 inches of the surface.  Redona soils have up to 15 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Amarose and Redona soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.  McAllister soils do not have a cambic horizon above the argillic horizon."
