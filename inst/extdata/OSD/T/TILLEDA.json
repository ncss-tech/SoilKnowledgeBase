  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Carbonates are typically below a depth of 60 inches, but are at depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons. The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and from 15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 10 percent throughout the pedon. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from  strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 4. This horizon does not meet the chemical criteria for a spodic horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nTilleda soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon or both). The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5 YR; value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is typically loam, but is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam in some pedons."

Keshena soils are in similar landscape positions in the less sloping areas where there is a perched seasonal high water table within a depth of 40 inches. Menominee soils are adjacent where there is a sand mantle on the till.  Solona soils are adjacent in lower lying positions and are somewhat poorly drained.  In some places, near the mesic-frigid lines, the somewhat poorly drained Symco soils are in low lying postions and are classified as mesic."
