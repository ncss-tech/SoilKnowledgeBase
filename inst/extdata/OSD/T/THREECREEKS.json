  "OVERVIEW": "The Threecreeks series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt mixed with loess. Threecreeks soils are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
