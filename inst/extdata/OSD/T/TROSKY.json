  "OVERVIEW": "The Trosky series consists of poorly drained soils formed in a mantle of silty material over glacial outwash on uplands. These soils have moderately slow or moderate permeability in the upper mantle and rapid permeability in the underlying sand and gravel.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Free carbonates typically are in all horizons but in some pedons the upper 10 inches or less of the A horizon lack free carbonates.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 14 to 24 inches. The depth to the 2C horizon range from 24 to 40 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon is less than 15 percent, but larger amounts are in the lower part of the B horizon in some pedons. The 2C horizon has 10 to 40 percent by gravel of mixed lithology. The A and B horizons typically lack gravel. However, in some pedons the horizon above the 2C horizon contains as much as 10 percent gravel. Between depths of 10 inches and the top of the 2C horizon the soil averages between 22 and 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent--typically less than 10 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, or is N 2/0 or N 3/0. Redoximorphic concentrations are in this horizon in some pedons. It typically is a silty clay loam but silt loam is included in the range. The reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has a matrix of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Redox depletions range from distinct to prominent. The B horizon typically is silty clay loam but silt loam is included in the range. Also, the lower few inches of this horizon in some pedons is sandy loam, loam, or clay loam. The reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly has redoximorphic features. It typically is coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or gravelly loamy coarse sand, but some pedons have a thin C1 horizon that is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. The C horizon ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils typically are on plain positions, and less commonly on slightly convex or slightly concave outwash plains and valley trains. Slope gradient is less than 2 percent. Trosky soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of silty aeolian or glaciofluvial deposits that are underlain by glacial outwash sand and gravel. These materials primarily were deposited during the pre-Cary substage of the Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual temperature is about 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 19 to 27 inches.  The frost free period ranges from 120 to 170 days.  Elevation ranges from 890 to 1950 feet above sea level."
