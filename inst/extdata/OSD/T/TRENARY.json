  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 1 to 20 percent in the substratum.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and from 0 to 15 percent in the substratum.  Stone content ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe A horizon has 5YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 1.  The E horizon has 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  In cultivated pedons, the A and E horizons are mixed into a dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) plow layer, 7 to 9 inches thick.  The A and E horizons are dominantly fine sandy loam, but the range includes sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid. The Bs horizon has 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bs horizons range from strongly acid to slightly acid.  Pedons with no Bhs horizons have a Bs1 horizon with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 that are strongly acid or moderately acid.  The Bhs and Bs horizons are dominantly fine sandy loam, but the range includes sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and silt loam.\nThe E' horizon has 2.5YR to 7.5YR hue, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Some pedons have E/B horizons, with E material with colors, texture and reaction similar to the E' horizon.  The E' horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has 2.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is dominantly loam or sandy clay loam and can range to sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 27 percent.  This horizon contains continuous films and clay flows.  At the juncture of the E' and Bt horizons, the outer portion of the peds typically are composed of E' material while the central portion is Bt material. Pedons that do not have a separate Bt horizon have glossic B/E horizons.  Some pedons have BC horizons. Reaction of the Bt horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is dominantly sandy loam but includes loam, fine sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Clay content ranges from 5 to 18 percent. It ranges from moderately alkaline to neutral.  Cobbles of red sandstone and dolomitic limestone are common throughout the profile, being most abundant in the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Montcalm, Sagola, and Ubly series.  The Montcalm soils have lamellae below the argillic horizon and 15 percent or less combine content of silt and clay in the substratum.  The Sagola soils have hue of 7.5YR in the C horizon.  The Ubly soils have more than 18 percent clay in the 2C horizon.  Closely related soils are the Alcona, Cheboygan, Goodman, Greylock, Mequithy, Newot, Padus, Padwet, and Sarona series.  All of these series have more active clay mineralogy than the Trenary series.  In addition, the Greylock soils average 8 to 15 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Mequithy soils are underlain by a lithic contact at depths from 20 to 40 inches.  Alcona soils are underlain by stratified silt to loamy sand from 20 to 40 inches.  Cheboygan soils have loamy sand or sand textures in the upper 20 to 40 inches.  Goodman and Sarona soils do not have free carbonates within depths of 60 inches.  Newot soils are underlain by dense till (Cd horizons) at depths from 40 to 80 inches.  Padus and Padwet soils have stratified sand and gravel outwash within depths of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trenary soils occupy nearly level to rolling areas on ground moraines and end moraines with dominant slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  Occasional hilly areas contain slopes up to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Shoepac, Charlevoix, Emmet, Ensley, Longrie, Mackinac, Munising, and Onaway soils.  The moderately well drained Shoepac, somewhat poorly drained Mackinac and Charlevoix and the poorly drained Ensley and Angelica soils form a drainage sequence with the Trenary soil.  The well drained Greylock, Emmet, Longrie, Munising, and Onaway series are commonly associated soils in similar landscape positions."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 6 inches (A and E horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 2 to 6 inches and from 17 to 26 inches (E and E' horizons); spodic horizon - the zone from 6 to 17 inches (Bhs and Bs horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 26 to 37 inches (Bt horizon).\nThe moderately well drained phase of this soil is no longer within the series concept.  The Shoepac soil replaces this phase.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
