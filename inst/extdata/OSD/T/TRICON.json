    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the petrocalcic horizon are 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are normally noncalcareous to depths of 8 to 20 inches.  These soils have a ustic moisture regime bordering aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is typically silt loam but includes loam and light clay loam.  This horizon has weak or moderate structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It ranges from heavy clay loam through light clay and heavy silty clay loam.  This horizon has moderate or strong structure.\nThe petrocalcic (Ccam) horizon has a wavy upper boundary and is continuous across a pedon without cracks.  Fifty percent of this horizon is weakly cemented (can be chipped with a spade) and 50 percent is indurated.  A laminar surface occurs  on 25 percent of this horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tricon soils are typically on broad upland plains.  Elevation is 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes dominantly range from 0 to 3 percent but range to 5 percent near some of the drainageways.  The soils formed in old alluvium and eolian sediments.  Purgatoire and Dakota sandstone are commonly beneath the petrocalcic horizon at an unknown depth.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The average annual temperature is 50 to 58 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is about 29.  The frost free season is about 140 to 180 days."

Bernal, Crews, Pastur, and Travessilla soils are shallower than 20 inches.  Also, Pastura and Travessilla soils lack argillic horizons.  Dioxice soils lack a petrocalcic horizon, and Patri soils lack a petrocalcic horizon within 40 inches."
