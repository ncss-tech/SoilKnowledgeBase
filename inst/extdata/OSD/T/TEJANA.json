  "OVERVIEW": "The Tejana series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in local alluvium derived from volcanic ash and cinders over sandstone on plains and mesas.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
