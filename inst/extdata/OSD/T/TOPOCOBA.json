  "OVERVIEW": "The Topocoba series consists of shallow to hardpan, well drained soils on plateaus and mesas.  These soils formed in alluvium from limestone and sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
