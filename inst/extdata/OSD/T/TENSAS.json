Acadia, Lagrue and Natalbany soils do not have a loamy 2BC horizon within a depth of 40 inches. Baldwin, Forestdale, and Midland soils have a dominantly gray and dark gray subsoil. In addition, Baldwin soils have a hyperthermic soil temperature regime. Dundee and Galvez soils are loamy throughout the subsoil. Openlake and Tunica soils do not have an argillic horizon. In addition, Tunica soils have an abrupt textural change."

They are on low natural levee positions of the Mississippi River and along narrow ridges in a ridge-swale topography. The soils formed in stratified alluvium of the Mississippi River. The clays are dominated by smectites; the coarser fraction below the discontinuity is mixed mineralogy. The climate is warm and humid with mean annual rainfall of 52 inches and mean annual temperature about 66 degrees F. Average January temperature 49 degrees F., and average July temperature 82 degrees F. at the type location."

    "content": "REMARKS: Tensas soils were reclassified from an Aeric Ochraqualf to an Aeric Epiaqualf in 2000; and from an Aeric Epiaqualf to a Chromic Vertic Epiaqualf in 2002 based on data from the type location pedon and other sampled pedons in Louisiana.  The depth range to the discontinuity was also decreased from 20 to 18 inches to agree with typical pedons from several previously correlated survey areas. The series was updated in 2004 to allow silty clay loam or clay loam in the lower part of the Btg horizon, and value 6 and slightly alkaline reaction in the substratum. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon ------- 0 to 4 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon ------ 5 to 19 inches (Btg horizons)\nAquic conditions ------ 4 to 9 inches (Btg1 horizon)\nEpisaturation --------- 0 to 11 inches (A and Btg1 horizons)\nLithologic Discontinuity -- 19 inches (top of the 2Bg horizon)"
