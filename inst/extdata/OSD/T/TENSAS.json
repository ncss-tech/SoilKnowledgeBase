    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Acadia and Natalbany series in the same family, and the Baldwin, Dundee, Forestdale, Galvez, Lagrue, Midland, Openlake and Tunica series in closely related families. Acadia, Lagrue and Natalbany soils do not have a loamy 2BC horizon within a depth of 40 inches. Baldwin, Forestdale, and Midland soils have a dominantly gray and dark gray subsoil. In addition, Baldwin soils have a hyperthermic soil temperature regime. Dundee and Galvez soils are loamy throughout the subsoil. Openlake and Tunica soils do not have an argillic horizon. In addition, Tunica soils have an abrupt textural change."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tensas soils are on convex slopes with gradients of 0 to about 8 percent. They are on low natural levee positions of the Mississippi River and along narrow ridges in a ridge-swale topography. The soils formed in stratified alluvium of the Mississippi River. The clays are dominated by smectites; the coarser fraction below the discontinuity is mixed mineralogy. The climate is warm and humid with mean annual rainfall of 52 inches and mean annual temperature about 66 degrees F. Average January temperature 49 degrees F., and average July temperature 82 degrees F. at the type location."

Alligator and Sharkey soils are on lower areas, are very-fine textured throughout, and do not have an argillic horizon. Dundee soils are on higher positions on the natural levees. Goldman soils are adjacent to Tensas soils on similar positions and are coarser textured."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Tensas soils were reclassified from an Aeric Ochraqualf to an Aeric Epiaqualf in 2000; and from an Aeric Epiaqualf to a Chromic Vertic Epiaqualf in 2002 based on data from the type location pedon and other sampled pedons in Louisiana.  The depth range to the discontinuity was also decreased from 20 to 18 inches to agree with typical pedons from several previously correlated survey areas. The series was updated in 2004 to allow silty clay loam or clay loam in the lower part of the Btg horizon, and value 6 and slightly alkaline reaction in the substratum. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon ------- 0 to 4 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon ------ 5 to 19 inches (Btg horizons)\nAquic conditions ------ 4 to 9 inches (Btg1 horizon)\nEpisaturation --------- 0 to 11 inches (A and Btg1 horizons)\nLithologic Discontinuity -- 19 inches (top of the 2Bg horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization analyses were run on samples from the type location pedon by NSSL, Lincoln, Nebraska (S96LA-107-005). Additional chemical test data are available for the survey area typical pedons and are published in the Soil Survey Reports of Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana (S79LA-009-022), Franklin Parish, Louisiana (S80LA-041-017), and Concordia Parish, Louisiana (S82LA-029-003); and fertility test data are available for the survey area typical pedons and are published in the Soil Survey Reports of East Carrol Parish, Louisiana (S83LA-035-007), Richland Parish, Louisiana (S86LA-083-011), and LaSalle Parish, Louisiana (S84LA-059-004).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
