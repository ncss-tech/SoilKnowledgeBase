  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Latah, Quicksell, and Setnum series. Latah soils have redoximorphic features in the Bt horizons and are somewhat poorly drained. Quicksell soils have mollic epipedons 10 to 16 inches thick, have 5 percent gravel throughout, and have 20 to 40 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Setnum soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact."

The soils formed in older loess, probably mostly of the recent or Pinedale surface, Early Bull Lake or Pre Bull Lake. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
