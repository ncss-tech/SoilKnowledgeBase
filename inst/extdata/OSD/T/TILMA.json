  "OVERVIEW": "The Tilma series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess. Tilma soils are on loess plains and hills, mainly near drainageways. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
