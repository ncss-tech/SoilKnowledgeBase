Ashmed, Bitter and Timosea soils are dry in the moisture control section during the summer months. Blind soils average fewer rock fragments and have higher clay content in the control section. They also receive more total rainfall and have a MAAT of 59 to 64 degrees F. Bluebird soils receive more total precipitation and have higher clay content in the control section. Highland soils have bedrock at 30 to 40 inches and average fewer rock fragments in the control section. Khyber soils have 40 to 80 percent of the gravel fraction in the 2 to 5 mm range. Nellake soils have more total rock fragments in the control section and are formed in granitic material. In addition, Khyber and Nellake soils do not have a layer with visible gypsum crystals within the argillic horizon. Pinaleno, Soledad, and Topawa soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days, cumulative, between July and October. In addition, Pinaleno soils have a calcic horizon, Soledad soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the control section, and Topawa soils have a MAST of 69 to 72 degrees F. Werewolf soils do not have 40 to 80 percent of the total gravel fraction in the 2 to 5 mm range. In addition, Werewolf soils do not have 1 percent or more visible carbonates throughout the argillic horizon."

The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."

They have sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and do not have an argillic horizon. Crosgrain soils do not have an argillic horizon, have a duripan within 20 inches and are found on steeper remnants and ballenas. Goldivide soils have an argillic horizon with an upper boundary at a depth of 20 or more inches, and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Goldivide soils are found on similar landscape positions but lack a patina or pavement surface. Langwell soils are found on adjacent hills, are 20 inches or less to a lithic contact, do not have an argillic horizon, and have a loamy particle-size control section."
