  "OVERVIEW": "The Towner series consists of very deep, well or moderately well drained soils that formed in wind and water deposited sands over glacial till or lacustrine sediments.  Permeability is rapid or moderately rapid in the upper part and moderate or moderately slow in the 2Bk and 2C horizons.  These soils are on sand-mantled till or glaciolacustrine plains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.   The lower A horizon below depths of about 19 inches has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand.  The A horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon.  A stony or gravelly layer is at the contact between the sandy mantle and the 2Bk horizon in some pedons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or silt loam.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue, value of 4 to 6, and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam or clay loam glacial till containing up to 19 percent coarse fragments, but some is silt loam or silty clay loam lacustrine sediments.  In addition, some pedons contain pockets or layers of sandy or clayey materials in some pedons.  The 2C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a C horizon above the 2C horizon."

Dickey and Maddock soils commonly are on nearby more sloping, higher lying areas.  Maddock soils are sandy.  Egeland and Serden are on nearby glaciolacustrine and outwash plains.  Egeland soils are coarse-loamy and Serden soils are sandy and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Embden, Grimstad, Hecla, Swenoda, and Ulen soils are on nearby deltas and lake plains.  Embden soils are coarse-loamy and pachic.  Grimstad and Ulen soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches.  Hecla soils have mottles with chromas of 2 or less within 40 inches of the surface.  Swenoda soils are coarse-loamy and pachic."
