  "OVERVIEW": "The Tombar series consists of moderately deep over carbonate-cemented hardpan, well drained soils that formed in material derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Tombar soils occur on mountain slopes and hills of 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
