  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tremona series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in interbedded sandy, clayey, and loamy residuum derived from sandstone, claystone, and shale.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on broad ridges on inland dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 990.6 mm (39 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
