    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Terino soils are on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, and terraces.  Slopes are usually 2 or 3 percent but range from about 1 to 12 percent.  The elevation is 3,400 to 5,700 feet.  The soils formed in dominantly very gravelly sediments derived primarily from such rocks as rhyolite, andesite and chert.  The mean annual air temperature is 58 to 68 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 16 inches with a summer maximum."
