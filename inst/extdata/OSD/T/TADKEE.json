Rock fragments, dominantly gravel, ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the A horizon, 0 to 20 percent in the Bg horizon, and 2 to 8 percent in the underlying loamy glacial till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or their mucky and gravelly analogues. The reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues. The reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nA Cg horizon is present in some pedons. Colors and textures are similar to that of the Bg horizon.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 2. It is loam or clay loam. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
