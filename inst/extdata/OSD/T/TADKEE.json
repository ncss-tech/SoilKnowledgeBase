  "REVDATE": "08/2006",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tadkee series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in a mantle of sandy material underlain by loamy glacial till at 20 to 40 inches on lake beaches on moraines. Permeability is rapid in the sandy materials and moderate in the loamy glacial till. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Rock fragments, dominantly gravel, ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the A horizon, 0 to 20 percent in the Bg horizon, and 2 to 8 percent in the underlying loamy glacial till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or their mucky and gravelly analogues. The reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues. The reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nA Cg horizon is present in some pedons. Colors and textures are similar to that of the Bg horizon.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 2. It is loam or clay loam. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
