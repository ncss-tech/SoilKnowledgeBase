  "OVERVIEW": "The Tokio series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in recent sandy eolian deposits over calcareous, loamy lacustrine deposits from the Tahoka Formation of Pleistocene age. Tokio soils are on nearly level and very gently sloping eolian plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 millimeters (19 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
