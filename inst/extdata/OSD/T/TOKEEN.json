The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 F, the mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.  The coarse fragment content of the particle-size control section ranges from 15 to 35 percent and is dominantly gravel size.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, and a value moist of 2 or 3.  The texture ranges from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly loam.\nThe B horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR, value moist of 2 through 5, and chroma moist of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam or loam with less than 35 percent coarse fragments.\nIn some pedons, a C horizon may be present above the bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tokeen soils occur on rocky convex backslopes and valleysides, are formed from colluvium from granitic rocks, and are underlain by granitic rocks.  The climate is humid maritime with a mean annual precipitation in excess of 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 degrees F and the mean summer air temperature is 55 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 100 percent.  Elevation ranges from 50 to 2000 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Karta, Kina, Kogish, Maybeso, McGilvery, Tolstoi, and Wadleigh series.  Karta and Wadleigh soils are formed from glacial till on hillslopes and valleysides. Kina, Kogish, and Maybeso soils are poorly drained organic soils in depressional areas.  McGilvery soils are partially decomposed forest litter resting directly on bedrock and are on hillslopes.  Tolstoi soils are shallow mineral soils on hillslopes."

The overstory vegetation is dominantly western hemlock with lesser amounts of Sitka spruce and western redcedar.  The understory vegetation consists largely of blueberry, rusty menziesia, devil's club, and mosses."
