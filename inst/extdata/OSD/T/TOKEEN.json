  "OVERVIEW": "The Tokeen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from granitic rock.  Tokeen soils are on convex backslopes from 5 to 100 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is in excess of 100 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 F, the mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.  The coarse fragment content of the particle-size control section ranges from 15 to 35 percent and is dominantly gravel size.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, and a value moist of 2 or 3.  The texture ranges from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly loam.\nThe B horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR, value moist of 2 through 5, and chroma moist of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam or loam with less than 35 percent coarse fragments.\nIn some pedons, a C horizon may be present above the bedrock."

Karta and Wadleigh soils are formed from glacial till on hillslopes and valleysides. Kina, Kogish, and Maybeso soils are poorly drained organic soils in depressional areas.  McGilvery soils are partially decomposed forest litter resting directly on bedrock and are on hillslopes.  Tolstoi soils are shallow mineral soils on hillslopes."
