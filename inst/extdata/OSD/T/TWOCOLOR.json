  "OVERVIEW": "The Twocolor series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lateral moraines of glaciated mountain slopes.  Twocolor soils formed in volcanic ash over till dominated by granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
