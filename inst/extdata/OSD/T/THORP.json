The depth to horizons with more than 10 percent sand ranges from 76 to 137 cm (30 to 54 inches). The mollic epipedon is 25 to 36 cm (10 to 14 inches) in thickness. The common clay mineral in the upper silty layers is smectite and in the lower loamy layers is illite. The particle-size control section averages between 27 and 35 percent clay and less than 10 percent fine sand or coarser. Carbonates are not present above 102 cm (40 inches).\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam. Clay content ranges from 20 to 27 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline depending upon liming practices.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam. Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features commonly have chroma of 1 to 8. The Btg horizon typically is silty clay loam, but some pedons are silt loam in some subhorizons. Clay content ranges from 22 to 35 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btg or 2BCg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 8. Typically it is sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, silt loam, or sandy loam. Many pedons contain strata of silty clay loam, loamy sand, or sand. Average clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent, and average sand content ranges from 10 to 55 percent. Volume of rock fragments is less than 10 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 8. It typically is stratified; textures include sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam. Some pedons contain thin strata of sand or loamy sand. Clay content ranges from 5 to 30 percent, and sand content ranges from 15 to 75 percent. Volume of rock fragments is less than 15 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

Corley, Ebbert, Edgington, Normal, Speed, and Vesser soils average less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Knight soils do not have horizons with more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 137 cm (54 inches). Marissa soils average less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section and have mean annual soil temperature of more than 12 degrees C (54 degrees F)."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches), frost-free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 155 to 396 m (510 to 1300 feet) above sea level."

Where drained, the apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In undrained conditions, the apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the solum and high (14.11 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and moderately rapid in the underlying material."

These soils will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if new series are needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches) (Ap and A horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 36 to 48 cm (14 to 19 inches) (Eg horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 48 to 127 cm (19 to 50 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and 2Btg4 horizons); aquic conditions - chroma of 1 or 2 and masses of iron accumulation in all horizons below the mollic epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Illinois sample numbers 21238-21248; data from another pedon in the same map unit and near the typical pedon.\nIn Iowa, the native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Rice Cutgrasses, Softstem Bulrushes, Needle Spikerushes, Broadfruit Burreeds, Pickerel Weeds, Broadleaf Cattails, Water Smartweeds, American Water Lilies, Yellow Pond Lilies, American Lotuses, Small Pondweeds, Sago Pondweeds, and Arrowheads.
