  "OVERVIEW": "The Thorp series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash or sandy loam till. They are on broad low summits or in depressions on outwash plains, stream terraces, or till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches).",

Carbonates are not present above 102 cm (40 inches).\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam. Clay content ranges from 20 to 27 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline depending upon liming practices.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam. Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features commonly have chroma of 1 to 8. The Btg horizon typically is silty clay loam, but some pedons are silt loam in some subhorizons. Clay content ranges from 22 to 35 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btg or 2BCg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 8. Typically it is sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, silt loam, or sandy loam. Many pedons contain strata of silty clay loam, loamy sand, or sand. Average clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent, and average sand content ranges from 10 to 55 percent. Volume of rock fragments is less than 10 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 8. It typically is stratified; textures include sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam. Some pedons contain thin strata of sand or loamy sand. Clay content ranges from 5 to 30 percent, and sand content ranges from 15 to 75 percent. Volume of rock fragments is less than 15 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

In undrained conditions, the apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years.
