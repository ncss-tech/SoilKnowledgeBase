Percent by volume of coral or limestone gravel sized fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 3.  Texture is muck or gravelly muck with a rubbed fiber content of less than 10 percent and an unrubbed fiber content of 15 to 50 percent.\nThe 2R horizon is hard but rippable coral limestone."
