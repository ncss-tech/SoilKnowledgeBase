  "OVERVIEW": "The Tips series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in material weathered mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
