  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Particle-size data is available for this pedon. The April 1993 revision placed the Tomotley series in fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Endoaquults. In several older soil surveys in South Carolina, and possibly other states, soils correlated Tomotley may have siliceous mineralogy. Those soils are outside the range of the series and no geographically associated soils that have siliceous mineralogy were listed in the April 1993 revision of the Tomotley series.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil properties recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from depths of 7 to 42 inches (Btg1 and Btg2\nhorizons)\nREVISED=7/9/96,MHC\nMLRAS=153A, 153B, 133A\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\nNC0167 TOMOTLEY    0-2    60- 70   200-270    45-55   5-100\nSOI-5    FloodL FloodH  Watertable    Kind    Months   Bedrock\nNC0167    NONE   RARE     0-1.0     APPARENT  NOV-APR  >60\nSOI-5    Depth    Texture         3-Inch   No-10   Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0167   0-7      LS LFS           0-0    95-100   2-10     1-8\nNC0167   0-7      SL FSL           0-0    95-100   5-20     2-10\nNC0167   0-7      SIL L            0-0    95-100   5-27     2-11\nNC0167   7-42     FSL SCL CL       0-0    95-100  18-35     4-8\nNC0167  42-50     FSL SCL SC       0-0    95-100  15-45     3-9\nNC0167  50-72     VAR\nSOI-5    Depth    -pH-     O.M.
