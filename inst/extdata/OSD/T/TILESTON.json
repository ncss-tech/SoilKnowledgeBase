  "OVERVIEW": "The Tileston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Tileston soils are on glaciated mountain slopes and moraines.  Slopes range from 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

(B/E and part of the Bt horizons)\nAlbic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 7 inches.  (E horizon)\nGlossic horizon:  The zone from 7 to 13 inches.  (E/B horizon)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 36 inches.  (B/E and Bt horizons)\nThe base saturation of this series is being studied. It is assumed that base saturation (by sum of cations) is greater than 35 percent at a depth of 125 cm below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon. Hence the base saturation is high enough to place this series in the Alfisols class and not in the Ultisols.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
