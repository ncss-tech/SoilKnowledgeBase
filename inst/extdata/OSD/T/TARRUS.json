    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout unless limed.  Rock fragments of quartz or other fine-grained rock range from 0 to 40 percent in individual horizons throughout.  Flakes of mica may be present throughout the soil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.   It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Eroded areas include clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow, red, or brown.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction and contains more than 30 percent silt or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, have hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow, red, or brown. Other colors occur as streaks or mottles in some pedons.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow, red, or brown. It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, slightly fractured to highly fractured argillite or other fine grained metavolcanic rock"

Georgeville and Herndon soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Nanford soils have Bt horizons that are 5YR or yellower."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tarrus soils are on gently sloping to very steep uplands.  The slopes are generally convex; gradients are mostly between 4 and 15 percent, but the extreme range is from 0 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from argillite or other fine-grained metavolcanic rocks of the Carolina Slate Belt.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 50 inches.  Length of growing season ranges from 175 to 240 days."

Alamance and Kirksey soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Gundy soils have a base saturation greater than 35 percent.  Lignum soils have iron depletions in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon. Goldston soils have paralithic contact at less than 20 inches."
