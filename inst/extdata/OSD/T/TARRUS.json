  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Tarrus series are deep and well drained. They have moderate permeability.  They formed in residuum from argillite or other fine-grained metavolcanic rocks of the Carolina Slate Belt.  These soils are on uplands of the Piedmont physiographic region.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout unless limed.  Rock fragments of quartz or other fine-grained rock range from 0 to 40 percent in individual horizons throughout.  Flakes of mica may be present throughout the soil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.   It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Eroded areas include clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow, red, or brown.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction and contains more than 30 percent silt or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, have hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow, red, or brown. Other colors occur as streaks or mottles in some pedons.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow, red, or brown. It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, slightly fractured to highly fractured argillite or other fine grained metavolcanic rock"
