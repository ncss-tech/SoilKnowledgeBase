  "OVERVIEW": "The Tourn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium and residuum derived from andesitic tuff. Tourn soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

This change better represents the soil series as mapped presently.\nThe revision of January 2004 updates the taxonomic class from Medial Xeric Haplocryands, changes temperature regime to frigid, updates horizon designations, and recognizes the presence of an argillic horizon.\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 inches (A1, A2 and the BA horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 37 inches (A1, A2, BA, and the Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 37 inches (Bt horizon).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 37 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 37 inches (Bt horizon)."
