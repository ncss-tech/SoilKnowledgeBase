Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,000 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 56 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: The revision of December 2004 changes the classification to Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls based on re-description of the recovered type location. This change better represents the soil series as mapped presently.\nThe revision of January 2004 updates the taxonomic class from Medial Xeric Haplocryands, changes temperature regime to frigid, updates horizon designations, and recognizes the presence of an argillic horizon.\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 inches (A1, A2 and the BA horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 37 inches (A1, A2, BA, and the Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 37 inches (Bt horizon).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 37 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 37 inches (Bt horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
