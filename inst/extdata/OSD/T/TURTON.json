Bearden soils have a calcic horizon and are at edges of swales and depressions.  Eckman, Embden, Gardena, Swenoda and Towner soils do not have a natric horizon and are on slightly higher parts of the landscape.  In addition, Eckman and Gardena soils have a coarse-silty control section; Embden and Swenoda soils have a coarse-loamy control section; and Towner soils are sandy over silty lacustrine sediments.  The poorly drained Stirum soils are in slight depressions."
