  "OVERVIEW": "The Twinpeaks series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained soils that are moderately permeable in the upper part and very slowly permeable in the petrocalcic horizon.  These undulating soils formed in gravelly loamy alluvium derived from chert and limestone.  They occur on alluvial fans and pediments situated below chert and limestone hills.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.",
