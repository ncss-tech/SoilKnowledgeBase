    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Twinpeaks soils are on alluvial fans and pediments below and adjacent to hills and mountains. The soils formed in very gravelly sediments derived primarily from chert and limestone bedrock. Slopes are dominantly 1 to 8 percent but range up to about 20 percent. The elevation ranges from 3,500 to 4,500 feet. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 65 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches with a summer maximum. Frost free period range from 210 to 260 days"

Bissett soils are shallow and very shallow to a lithic contact over limestone bedrock.  Bullis soils occur on similar landforms, but are very deep and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  Buckear soils are shallow and very shallow to a paralithic contact over shale bedrock.  Catto soils are shallow and very shallow to a lithic contact over chert bedrock.  Coyanosa soils are shallow and very shallow to lithic contact over sandstone bedrock.  Paisano soils occur on similar landforms, but do not contain an argillic horizon.  Stillwell occur on alluvial flats below Twinpeaks soils, and do not contain an argillic horizon."
