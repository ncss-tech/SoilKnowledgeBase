The soil between the depths of 7 and 21 inches is dry in all parts from June to October and is moist in some part the rest of the year.  The particle-size control section averages 30 percent clay and has a range of 11 to 15 percent fine sand or coarser, including fragments up to 7.5 cm in diameter.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2, or 6/4 dry.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/3, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2, or 4/4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe upper Bt horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 6/3, 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, or 4/4 dry.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or loam, and contains about 10 to 15 percent more clay than the A horizon.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe lower Bt horizon colors are 10YR 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/3, 6/4, or 6/6 dry.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3, or 4/4.  Textures are clay loam, silty clay loam or stratified very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam and very gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.  Some pedons have a perched water table at 36 to 50 inches from December through March."
