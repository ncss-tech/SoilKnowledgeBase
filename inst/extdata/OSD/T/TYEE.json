  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts for 90 to 105 consecutive days following summer solstice in most years.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 18 inches thick.  Rock fragments (mostly angular fine 2 to 20 mm pebbles) average 10 to 35 percent.  The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.55 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.40 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The soil averages 3 to 10 percent clay.  Base saturation (by sum of the cations) is assumed to be 50 to 75 percent throughout.  Reaction is slightly acid or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 1 through 3 moist.  Some pedons have a gravelly coarse sandy loam lower surface layer.  The A horizon is 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Some pedons are stony.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam, and is 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is sandy  loam, or coarse sandy loam.  It averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tyee soils are on mountainsides and ridge tops that generally have a south aspect at elevations of 1,000 to 3,600 feet, although north slope phases are recognized.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.   These soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and slope alluvium from granite, quartz diorite, granodiorite quartz monzonite, or gneiss mixed with loess and a small amount of volcanic ash in the upper part.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist  winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to l8 inches.  The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 70 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 110 to 155 days."

Entiat soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Skanid and Swakane soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Also, Swakane soils have a lithic contact at 10 to 20 inches."
