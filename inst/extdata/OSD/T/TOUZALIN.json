  "OVERVIEW": "The Touzalin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy fluvial sediments of Holocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level to undulating flood plains in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA-77E).  The slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
