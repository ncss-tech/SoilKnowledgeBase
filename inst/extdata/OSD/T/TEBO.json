  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tebo soils are on glaciated uplands, intermediate in position between the outwash plains and the higher basaltic mountainous areas.  Slopes are 1 to 65 percent.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 800 feet.  These soils formed in glacial drift high in basalt.  Tebo soils are in a humid marine climate with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  They have an annual precipitation of 50 to 70 inches.  The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days."
