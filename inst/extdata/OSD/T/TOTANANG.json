  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Totanang soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 61 to 152 cm (24 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. These soils are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days."

The somewhat poorly drained Lafayette soils have grayer profiles and are in slightly lower lying positions on the landform. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Mahalaland soils have dominantly gray profiles and are in lower lying areas. The well drained Waupecan soils are on slightly higher landform positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 76 to 107 cm (2.5 to 3.5 feet) during the winter and spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loess, high in the outwash subsoil, and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the loess, moderately rapid in the outwash subsoil, very rapid in the underlying material."

In areas that are forested, oaks and maple are the most common tree species. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, chiefly blue stem."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was mapped as Waupecan, moderately wet, in Tippecanoe and Warren Counties Indiana. Transect information from these counties indicate the need for a new series. Loess capping was typically thicker than Tippecanoe. The typical pedon above was previously correlated Waupecan, moderately wet, in Warren County.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 158 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nRepresentative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153444 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
