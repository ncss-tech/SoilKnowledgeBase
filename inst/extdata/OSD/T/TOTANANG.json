  "OVERVIEW": "The Totanang series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The Totanang soils formed in loess and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Loess capping was typically thicker than Tippecanoe. The typical pedon above was previously correlated Waupecan, moderately wet, in Warren County.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 158 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nRepresentative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153444 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
