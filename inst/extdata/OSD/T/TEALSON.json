  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 6 to 16 inches. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The control section is usually sandy loam but averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons. It ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bucklon, Devoe, Fifer, Fusulina, and Sawpit series.  Bucklon, Fusulina, and Sawpit soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Devoe soils are calcareous throughout and have a higher bulk calcium carbonate equivalent due to the presence of small limestone gravel and flat fragments.  Fifer soils are calcareous throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tealson soils are on gently to steeply sloping upland hills and ridges where soft sandstone bedrock occurs near the surface.  Slopes typically range from 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in thin deposits of moderately coarse textured parent material weathered from underlying calcareous soft sandstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. The average annual temperature is 40 degrees F., and average summer temperature is 56 degrees F."
