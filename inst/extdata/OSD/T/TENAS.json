    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is less than 47 degrees F. The upper part of the control section is dominated by volcanic ash. The remainder of the control section has mixed mineralogy and has 20 to 30 percent clay. The control section averages 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 18 inches thick. The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 36 inches. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It has weak granular or blocky structure and is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is clay loam and may be gravelly. This horizon is moderately acid to strongly acid."

They formed in volcanic ash over andesite residuum. These soils occur in a cold, subhumid climate. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches, occurring mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. The frost free period is 80 to 100 days."
