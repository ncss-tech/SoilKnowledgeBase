  "OVERVIEW": "The Tibson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alpine till, alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived mainly from limestone, dolomite, sandstone and argillite rock.  These soils are on moraines, stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, mountains, hills, ridges and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
