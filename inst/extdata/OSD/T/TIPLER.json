  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the loamy mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 24 to 40 inches.  The sandy outwash has more than 85 percent sand.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel typically increases with depth in the loamy mantle and ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 50 percent as an average in the stratified sandy outwash but ranges from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but it ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon.  Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; anc chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs but in some pedons, it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon less than 3 inches thick with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nTipler soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons or both).  The E' part has colors and textures like the E' horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; anc chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above. Some pedons with a B/E horizon do not have a Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt or 2BC horizon with hue or 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs."

Annalake and Padwood soils have stratified loamy and sandy textures (lacustrine deposits) and average less than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Goodwit soils have a 12 to 40 inch thick mantle with more than 50 percent silt and have less than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Newood and Sarwet soils have less than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Peavy soils do not have a glossic horizon. Shoepac soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Padus soils do not have redox features or a seasonal high water table.  Padwet soils have redox accumulations and a zone of near saturation within 40 inches but do not have a water table."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tipler soils are on glacial lake plains, outwash plains, outwash terraces, and in outwash areas within morainic topography.  They formed mostly in loamy alluvium or eolian deposits underlain by stratified sandy outwash.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1900 feet."

The well drained Padus soils, the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils, and the poorly drained Minocqua soils form a drainage sequence with the Tipler soils.  The well drained Goodman, Laona, Sarona, and Soperton soils and the moderately well drained Argonne, Goodwit, Sarwet, and Wabeno soils are nearby where the parent material is till.  The moderately well drained Manitowish soils are nearby where the loamy deposits are thinner over the sand and gravel."
