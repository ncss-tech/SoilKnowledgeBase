  "OVERVIEW": "The Tulelake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine deposits from mixed sources. Tulelake soils are in reclaimed former lake basin or intermittent lake basins and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
