A seasonal high water table is present at a depth of 3 feet above ground  surface to 3 feet below ground from December through April. During the summer and early fall months the water table drops to a depth of 3 to greater than 6 feet. Distinct or prominent mottles occur throughout the profile.  Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent in the upper 8 inches of the profile and is less than 1 percent below 10 inches. Organic matter content decreases irregularly with increasing depth. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, or 2.5Y 4/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 4/1, 5/1, or 2.5Y 4/2. Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2, 6/1, 6/2, or 2.5Y 4/2. Moist color is N 3/0; 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, or 2.5Y 4/4. The upper part of the C horizon to a depth of 20 inches has a moist chroma of 0, 1, or 2. Moist chroma of 2, 3, or 4 occur in some subhorizon between 20 and 30 inches. It is stratified silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline. The lower part of the C horizon is calcareous in most but not all pedons."
