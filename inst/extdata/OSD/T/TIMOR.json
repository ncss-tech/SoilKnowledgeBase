  "OVERVIEW": "The Timor series consists of deep to hardpan, moderately well drained soils formed in granitic alluvium.  Timor soils are on low fan terraces or alluvial fans.  Slopes is 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of about 12 and 45 inches is usually dry in all parts from June to October unless irrigated, and moist in all parts from December to April.  Distinct and prominent mottles in hues of 5YR or 7.5YR are usually present at depths of 30 to 48 inches.  Clay content is 2 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, or 4/3 and moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.  This horizon has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe Bk horizon is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4 and moist color is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, or 3/3.  It commonly is loamy sand, but includes loamy coarse sand or sand in the lower part of some pedons.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bqkm horizon is 10YR 7/3, 7/2, 7/1, 6/2 or 6/1 and moist color is 10YR 5/2 or 2.5Y 5/2."
