    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to Bk horizon is 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to duripan is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of about 12 and 45 inches is usually dry in all parts from June to October unless irrigated, and moist in all parts from December to April.  Distinct and prominent mottles in hues of 5YR or 7.5YR are usually present at depths of 30 to 48 inches.  Clay content is 2 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, or 4/3 and moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.  This horizon has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe Bk horizon is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4 and moist color is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, or 3/3.  It commonly is loamy sand, but includes loamy coarse sand or sand in the lower part of some pedons.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bqkm horizon is 10YR 7/3, 7/2, 7/1, 6/2 or 6/1 and moist color is 10YR 5/2 or 2.5Y 5/2."

Elevations are 20 to 40 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs in winter months.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 to 61 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 260 to 280 days."
