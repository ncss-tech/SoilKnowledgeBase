  "OVERVIEW": "The Tanglenook series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on high floodplains, terraces, basins, and footslopes. They formed in silty and clayey alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

The average clay content of the particle size control section is 40 to 55 percent and the average sand content is 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 56 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, commonly a value of 3, but ranges to 4 or 5 as depth increases, and chroma of 1 or 2.  A few or common fine mottles of high and low chroma are in the Bt and lower horizons.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam, with 35 to 60 percent clay.  Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg or BCg horizon, if present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y or gleyed, value of 2.5 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.  Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Cg horizon is similar to the Btg horizon, but soils that have thin strata of silt loam or silty clay loam with clay of 25 to 35 percent are within the range of the series."
