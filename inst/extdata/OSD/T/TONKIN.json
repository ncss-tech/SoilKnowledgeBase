    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tonkin soils are on alluvial terraces or lake plains at elevations of 1,770 to 1,800 meters. Slope are 0 to 1 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived primarily from shale, quartzite, conglomerate, limestone, and siliceous rocks. The climate is cool semiarid. Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. Mean annual temperature is 5 to 6 degrees C. and the frost free season is 80 to 100 days."
