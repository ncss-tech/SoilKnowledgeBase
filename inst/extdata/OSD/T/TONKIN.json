  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonkin series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived primarily from shale, quartzite, conglomerate, limestone, and siliceous rocks. Tonkin soils are on alluvial terraces or lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual soil temperature is about 225 mm and the annual soil temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
