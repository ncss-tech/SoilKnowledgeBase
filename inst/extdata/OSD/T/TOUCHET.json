These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay.  Mottles are in the lower part of the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon below 40 inches that is very gravelly sand, very cobbly sand, or very gravelly sandy loam"

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Covello soils are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in the A horizon and are somewhat poorly drained.  Hermiston, Mondovi, and Onyx soils lack mottles in the particle-size control section.  Pedigo soils are calcareous and strongly alkaline throughout the A horizon.  Powder soils are usually dry and are calcareous in the lower part of the A horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Touchet soils are on flood plains at elevations of 500 to 1,000 feet.  They formed in recent alluvium mostly from loess.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  These soils are in a climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The average January temperature is about 32 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 73 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 150 to 170 days."

Walla Walla soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick, lack mottles, and have a regular decrease of organic carbon with depth.  Yakima soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
