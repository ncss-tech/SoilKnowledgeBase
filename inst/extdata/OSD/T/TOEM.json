Rock outcrops and stones are common.  These soils formed in place from granitic rock in a humid climate having an average annual precipitation of 640 to 1525 mm, most of which occurs as snow. The average annual temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C, the mean January temperature is -3.3 degrees C, and the mean July temperature is 13.3 degrees C.  Frost-free season is less than 90 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Toem soils were formerly classified in the cryic temperature regime because of the concept that an O horizon needed to be thicker than 3 inches to qualify as an O horizon. Now, the Toem soils are assumed to have O horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The Toem pedon description in Soil Survey Investigation Report No. 24, pg. 318-319 is used as the typical pedon; NSSL Number S68CA-017-023.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
