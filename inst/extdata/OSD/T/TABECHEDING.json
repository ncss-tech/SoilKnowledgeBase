Aimeliik is under forest vegetation, Palau under anthropic savannah, and Babelthuap and Ngardmau under degraded anthropic savannah.  Babelthuap and Ngardmau soils contain 30 to 75 percent ferritic and gibbsitic concretions.  Ngatpang soils formed in marine terrace deposits but are moderately well drained and have an oxic horizon."
