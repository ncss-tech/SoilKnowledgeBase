These soils, with the exception of the Ngatpang soils, are well drained upland soils formed in residuum derived from highly weathered volcanic rock.  Aimeliik is under forest vegetation, Palau under anthropic savannah, and Babelthuap and Ngardmau under degraded anthropic savannah.  Babelthuap and Ngardmau soils contain 30 to 75 percent ferritic and gibbsitic concretions.  Ngatpang soils formed in marine terrace deposits but are moderately well drained and have an oxic horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Laboratory data indicates that the C horizon has a high shrink-swell potential (COLE = 0.155 for C1).  However, due to very high moisture conditions of both in situ and disturbed samples, shrink-swell potential should be rated moderate, except where interpretation for pottery is concerned.\nLocal pronunciation of the word Tabecheding is \"Tabeding.\"\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Sample No. S79 TQ 632 004 characterized by National Soils Lab, Lincoln, Nebraska.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
