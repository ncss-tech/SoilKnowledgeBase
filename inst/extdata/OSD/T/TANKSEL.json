  "OVERVIEW": "The Tanksel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from basalt with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface horizons.  These soils are found on hillslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
