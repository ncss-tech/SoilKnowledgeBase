These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 100 to 120 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 29 inches.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent on air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments by volume. Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to [SW2]3, dry or moist.  It is ashy loam with 15 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 7 percent stones, 0 to 7 percent cobbles, and 5 to 20 percent gravel. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 3 percent.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly ashy loam, ashy loam, or stony ashy silt loam with 15 to 27 percent clay.

These soils formed in colluvium from basalt with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface horizons.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,300.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with hot dry summers and cold wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 80 to 135 days."
