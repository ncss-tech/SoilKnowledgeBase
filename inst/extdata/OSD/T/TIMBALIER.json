  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to clayey mineral layers ranges from 51 inches to more than 100 inches.  Salinity is high or very high.  Conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 8 to more than 16 dS/m in some layer within a depth of 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the surface tier and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower tiers.  The n-value is more than 1 throughout.  The organic fraction is dominantly herbaceous material but some pedons have thin strata of woody peat and/or wood fragments.  Mineral content of the organic layers ranges from 30 to 70 percent.\nThe surface tier (0 to 12 inches) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Fiber content after rubbing ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Some pedons have a mineral over-wash surface layer 2 to 16 inches thick.\nThe subsurface tier (12 to 36 inches) and bottom tier (36 to 48 inches) have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Rubbed fiber content averages between 1 and 10 percent of the organic volume.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is moderately fluid or very fluid clay, mucky clay, or silty clay.  Some pedons have an Ag horizon with value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 2."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Lafitte and Maurepas series in the same family, and the Allemands, Terra Ceia, and Kenner series.  Allemands, Kenner, and Maurepas soils have low salt content.  Lafitte soils have less salinity in the control section and are in brackish marshes.  Terra Ceia soils are nonsaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Timbalier soils are on low Gulf coastal saline marshes at elevations of less than 1 foot.  They commonly adjoin the open Gulf or saltwater bays and are flooded very frequently or frequently with saltwater.  Slopes range from 0 to 0.2 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 67 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lafitte series and the Bellpass, Clovelly, and Scatlake series.  Bellpass and Clovelly soils have mineral layers 30 cm or more thick that have the upper boundary within the control section below the surface tier.  Lafitte and Clovelly soils are in brackish marshes.  Scatlake soils are on slightly higher elevations and are fluid mineral soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Timbalier soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible or ponded.  Permeability is rapid in the organic layers.  Water is at a depth of 0.5 foot below the soil surface to 1 foot above most of the time.  During tropical storms, tidal floodwater is as deep as 4 feet or more."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for wildlife habitat and recreation.  This soil has many small areas of open water.  The vegetation at the type location is 80 percent smooth cordgrass, 10 percent saltgrass, and 5 percent marshhay cordgrass.  Other plants common to this soil are needlegrass rush, bushy sea-oxeye, woody glasswort, and maritime saltwort.  Black mangrove grows on this soil only in a belt adjacent to the coastline of the Gulf."
