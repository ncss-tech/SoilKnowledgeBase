  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Telferner series.  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.  The classification of this series was changed in 2016 during the update of MLRA 150A. The previous classification of Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs was based on a preliminary anlaysis of data from study of similar soils. A more detailed analysis of the data indicated that reduction only occurred during abnormally wet times. During normal years, these soils do not reduce or saturate long enough for oxyaquic criteria. The series classification supports mixed mineralogy and is based on reference samples tested for mineralogy by Texas A&M University.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon: 23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 in) (E horizon)\nAbrupt textural change: 41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 in) (Bt1 horizon)\nVertic feature: Cracks and/or wedge-shaped aggregates within the upper part of the argillic horizon.\nArgillic horizon: 41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 and Bt5 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data pending on pedons for project C2017USTX035.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
