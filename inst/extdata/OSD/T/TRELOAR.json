Blake, Haynie, Lowmo, and Peers soils contain less sand in the upper part of the control section, lack contrasting textures, and occur on similar landforms. Kenmoor soils have more clay in the lower part of the control section and are on similar landforms. Sarpy soils are better drained, lack contrasting textures and occur on similar but slightly higher landforms."

Permeability is rapid in the upper part and moderate in the lower part. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) is 42 to 141 micrometers per second in the upper sandy part and 4-14 micrometers per second in the lower loamy part. In undisturbed areas an apparent water table has an upper limit of 51 to 100 centimeters (20 to 39 inches) during November to May in most years. These soils are subject to frequent and occasional flooding."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formed primarily by levee failures and the resultant sand deposition from blow holes. Reclamation resulted in extremely variable soil horizons which change in very short distances. The name is from a small village in Warren County.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: orchic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 centimeters (7 inches) (Ap horizon); depth to strongly contrasting particle size  71 centimeters (28 inches) (top of 2Bw1 horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 71 to 114 centimeters (28 inches to 45 inches) (2Bw horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data; University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri; Pedon ID M0721903 is data for the OSD typical pedon; Pedon IDs M0707115, M0713907, M0721916, M0713909, M0718317, M0707108, M0702740, M0718905, M0718906, M9601901 and M0702725, are additional data used for the series range in characteristics.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
