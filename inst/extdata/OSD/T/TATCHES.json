Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The Plainfield, Coloma, and Benona soils have more sand in the upper part of the profile. The Benona soils have a spodic horizon. The Milarch soils have finer textures in the upper part of the profile. They all are on landscape positions similar to those of the Tatches soils."
