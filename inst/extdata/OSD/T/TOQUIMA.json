  "OVERVIEW": "The Toquima series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Toquima soils are on mountains. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
