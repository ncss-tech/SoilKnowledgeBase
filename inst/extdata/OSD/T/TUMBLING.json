    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Christiana, Dunmore and Shottower series are in the same family. Christiana soils developed in unconsolidated sediments on the Upper Coastal Plain. Dunmore soils developed in clayey residuum of limestones and dolomites. Shottower soils developed in old alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, limestone, shale and siltstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slope gradients range from 2 to 45 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atkins, Berks, Craigsville, Dekalb, Ernest, Frederick, Jefferson, Lily and Weikert series. Atkins and Craigsville soils have less clay in the subsoil and occur on floodplains. Berks, Dekalb, Lily and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock and occur on convex ridgetops and side slopes. Ernest soils have a fragipan and are on similar landscapes. Frederick soils have more clay in the subsoil and occur on convex ridgetops and side slopes. Jefferson soils have less clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscape positions."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now within the range of the Tumbling series were previously correlated as Nolichucky, Jefferson and Allen series in published soil surveys. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 through 6 inches (Ap horizon)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 60 inches (Bt horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Ranges for morphology, chemistry and particle-size distribution are based on 9 pedons. Mineralogical classification is based on 2 pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
