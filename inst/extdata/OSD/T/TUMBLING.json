  "OVERVIEW": "The Tumbling series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material derived from sandstone, quartzite and shale on colluvial fans and concave footslopes. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
