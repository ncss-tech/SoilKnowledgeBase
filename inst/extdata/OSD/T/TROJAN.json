    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trojan soils are on hills and mountains.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite and basalt in California or schist and argillite in Utah.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,900 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 28 inches including an annual snowfall of 24 to 36 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 39 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of January 2004 updates the taxonomic class from  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class is estimated based on properties of similar soils in major land resource areas 21 and 22A.  Trojan soils in MLRA 47 may need correlation in the future to another series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 67 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 67 inches to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 30 inches (Bt1 horizon and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
