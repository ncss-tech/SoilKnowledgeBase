    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a fractured lithic contact is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 degrees to 58 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 32 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to September 15.  The particle-size control section (6 to 26 inches) averages from 27 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction of the solum is slightly to strongly acid (in some cases the surface horizon may be neutral).\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 7.5YR 4/2, 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 or 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4.  Only the upper 2 to 5 inches have moist values and chromas which qualify for a mollic epipedon.  It is loam or gravelly loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4 or 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4 or 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6.  It is very gravelly clay loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Base saturation by Hach Kit (sum of cations) 50 inches below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 17 percent."
