The Bw horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value moist of 2, 3 or 4; and chroma moist of 2, 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, silt, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Klawasi and Tolsona soils.  Klawasi soils are on lacustrine terraces and have less than 10 inches of a loess mantle over clayey substratums.  Tolsona soils are on similar landforms and are the permafrost counterparts of the Tsana soils.  Due to disturbance of the organic mat, the permafrost table and water table have dropped below the control section in the Tsana soils."
