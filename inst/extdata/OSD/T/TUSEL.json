  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tusel soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on north-facing backslope and summit positions.  Soil slippage and slumps are common in some areas. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite, chert, and shale with surficial deposits of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,960 meters.  The climate is dry-subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 380 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is less than 70 days."

Soils mapped with the Tusel series with volcanic and conglomerate parent material should be checked for glass in the argillic and probably correlated to another series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
