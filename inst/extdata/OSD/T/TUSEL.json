  "OVERVIEW": "The Tusel series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite, chert and shale with surficial deposits of loess and volcanic ash.  Tusel soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tusel soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on north-facing backslope and summit positions.  Soil slippage and slumps are common in some areas. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite, chert, and shale with surficial deposits of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,960 meters.  The climate is dry-subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 380 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is less than 70 days."
