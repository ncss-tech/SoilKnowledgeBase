Penoyer soils do not have horizons with secondary carbonates, average less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and are intermittently moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative in summer months.  Smaug soils do not have horizons with secondary carbonates and formed in lacustrine deposits with platy structure.  Yipor soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C and average less than 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Toano soils are on alluvial flats, fan skirts, inset fans, lagoons, and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
