  "OVERVIEW": "The Toano series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Toano soils are on alluvial flats, fan skirts, inset fans, lagoons, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
