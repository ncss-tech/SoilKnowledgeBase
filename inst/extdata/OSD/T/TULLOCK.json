  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils typically effervesce throughout but some in some pedons the A horizon is leached.  Depth to paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The soil has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days between July 15 and October 25. The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or warmer for 175 to 192 days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or fine sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon.  When present, it has hue or 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is soft calcareous sandstone which may be interbeded with conglomerate or shale in some areas."
