  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tullock series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils formed in residuum, alluvium or eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  They are on dunes, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soil has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days between July 15 and October 25. The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or warmer for 175 to 192 days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or fine sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon.  When present, it has hue or 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is soft calcareous sandstone which may be interbeded with conglomerate or shale in some areas."
