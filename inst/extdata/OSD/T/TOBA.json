  "REVDATE": "11/2016",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Toba series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sands. Toba soils are on axial stream floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
