  "REVDATE": "09/2008",
  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Travelers series consists of shallow, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt, andesite and/or rhyolite.  Travelers soils are on basalt flows, mesas and hillslopes capped by basalt, and have slopes of 1 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
