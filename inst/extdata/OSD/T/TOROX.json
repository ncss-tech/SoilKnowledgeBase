Through MLRA update activities the majority of the units were found to fit an Aquic subgroup and did not meet the requirements of an Aquollic subgroup (Toronto). Also those units had a bulk density of 1.45 to 1.70 g/cm3 in the lower part of the series control section whereas Xenia soils have a bulk density of 1.70 to 1.90 g/cm3.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 25 to 107 cm (10 to 42 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons); discontinuity at a depth of 64 cm (25 inches) - the contact between the Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons."
