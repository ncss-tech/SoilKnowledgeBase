  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum is 28 to 46 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 65 degrees. The soil between depths of about 8 and 25 inches is dry most of the year and is not moist for as long as 60 consecutive days in winter and spring. Rock fragments are in the form of fine gravel and they are less than 10 percent of all horizons. The soils are calcareous in all parts. Distinct lime segregations do not occur within 40 inches of the surface. The A horizon is grayish brown to light yellowish brown (10YR 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4). It is dominantly sandy loam, but in some pedons or parts of some pedons the upper few inches are loamy sand or sand, especially under shrubs. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is massive or has weak platy structure in the upper part. The B2t horizon is grayish brown to light gray (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2). It is sandy loam or heavy sandy loam with about 14 to 18 percent clay and has 3 to 6 percent more clay absolute than the A horizon. The B2 horizon is strongly or very strongly alkaline and has 15 to 30 percent exchangeable sodium in all parts. This horizon is massive or has weak coarse angular or subangular blocky structure. The C horizon is grayish brown to light olive brown (10YR 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 5/4). It is sandy loam or loamy sand and is uniform in texture or has some stratification."

Lost Hills soils have prismatic structure in the argillic horizon. (See Remarks).  Onite and Sonoita soils have 7.5YR and 5YR hues in the argillic horizon.  Onite soils are dominantly noncalcareous in the A and B horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tray soils are nearly level and are along the rim or in basins at elevations of 2,300 to 2,400 feet. They formed in alluvium dominantly from granitic sources. The climate is arid with long hot summers and cool somewhat moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 9 inches. Average January temperature is 44 degrees., average July temperature is 82 degrees., and mean annual temperature is 63 degrees.  The freeze-free season is 240 to 260 days."

Pond soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Rosamond soils lack argillic horizons. Sunrise soils lack argillic horizons and have distinct calcic horizons within a depth of 40 inches."
