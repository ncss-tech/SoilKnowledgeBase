Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Ireteba, Popson, and Victorville series.   Anthony, Gila, Grabe, Ireteba, and Rucker soils have dominant hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.    Junction soils contain moderate amounts of gypsum in the profile. Excelsior, Popson and Victorville soils receive their precipitation in the winter and are dry in the soil moisture control section from April to December."

These soils formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches, occurring mostly as thunderstorms in July and August and gentle rains in November through March. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F. The average frost-free season is 10 to 195 days."

Harrisburg soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths of less than 40 inches.  Leeds soils are in a fine-loamy family. Pintura soils have fine sand or loamy fine sand control sections. St. George soils are in a coarse-silty family and are high in gypsum content."
