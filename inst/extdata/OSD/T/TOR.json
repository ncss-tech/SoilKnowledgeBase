  "REVDATE": "4/98",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tor series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a thin mantle of glacial till overlying sandstone, siltstone, or shale bedrock. These soils are on bedrock controlled benches and steps on hillsides, mountain sides and upland flats. Bedrock is at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 19 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in the A horizon and 35 to 50 percent in the B and C horizon. Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Some undisturbed pedons have a thin Oi horizon at the surface. Also, some pedons have gray sandy loam E horizons.\nThe B or Bg horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 2 or 3, and redox concentrations are present. If the chroma of the matrix is greater than 2 then >50 % of ped faces have chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky or prismatic. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon, if present, has color and texture similar to the B horizon. It has plate-like divisions or it is massive."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.;  mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches; and the frost free period ranges from 100 to 130 days.

Halcott soils are better drained and on drier parts of the same landscapes. Elka, Lewbeach and Willowemoc are very deep soils. Mongaup and Vly soils are better drained and moderately deep. Onteora and Suny soils occur in the same general landscape positions but are very deep to bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Original classification placed Tor in the great group of Haplaquepts. Because of changes established in the 5th and 6th editions of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the great group of Endoaquepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - 2 to 7 inches (A horizon)\n2) Cambic horizon - from 7 to 19 inches (Bg horizon)\n3) aquic moisture conditions - as evidenced by reduced low chroma (2 or less) matrix colors and redoximorphic features from within 20 inches of the soil surface (Bg horizon -7 to 19 inches)\n4) Lithic - bedrock starting within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface at 21 inches. Mineral soil surface starts at 2 inches.\nSoil Interpretation Record: NY0343, NY0344\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
