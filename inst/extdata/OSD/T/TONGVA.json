Arujo soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to granitic paralithic material, and have a mean summer temperature that differs by greater than 25 degrees F. from the mean winter temperature. Botella, Chico, Corona, Elkhorn, Havala, Lockwood, and Saltcanyon soils are all greater than 60 inches to rock. McCoy soils are 25 to 40 inches to granitic paralithic material and have Bt horizons that are slightly to moderately alkaline. Sapwi soils have very gravelly, very cobbly or very stony textures in the lower part of the argillic horizon, and they lack paralithic horizons."

These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from weathered andesite and basalt. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 500 to 3100 feet (152 to 945 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches (457 to 610 millimeters), the mean annual temperature is 60 to 73 degrees F. (16 to 23 degrees C.), and the frost free season is to 290 to 365 days."
