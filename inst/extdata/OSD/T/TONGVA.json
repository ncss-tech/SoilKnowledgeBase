  "OVERVIEW": "The Tongva series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from weathered andesite and basalt. Tongva soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches (533 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F. (16 degrees C.)",

Arujo soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to granitic paralithic material, and have a mean summer temperature that differs by greater than 25 degrees F. from the mean winter temperature. Botella, Chico, Corona, Elkhorn, Havala, Lockwood, and Saltcanyon soils are all greater than 60 inches to rock. McCoy soils are 25 to 40 inches to granitic paralithic material and have Bt horizons that are slightly to moderately alkaline. Sapwi soils have very gravelly, very cobbly or very stony textures in the lower part of the argillic horizon, and they lack paralithic horizons."
