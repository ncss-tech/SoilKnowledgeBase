  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tineoyler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, predominantly sandstone.  Tineoyler soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C).",
