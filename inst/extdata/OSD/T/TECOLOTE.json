    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 1 to 4 inches. (A horizon)\nAlbic horizon: 4 to 13 inches. (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 30 to 46 inches. (Bt horizon)\nType location was moved from Lincoln County, NM to El Paso County, CO on 5/01.  The series range was narrowed to MLRAs 48A and 49. It is unclear whether the historical climax plant community at the type location includes Douglas-fir or whether it is only ponderosa pine. At the El Paso County type location there is no pinyon-juniper vegetation, which was on the original type location in New Mexico; this is now outside the series concept. The moisture regime subclass is left as typic ustic on the 11/2007 revision, but if it can be verified that this series typically has a Douglas-fir climax plant community, the classification will likely be updated to a Udic subgroup, udic ustic moisture subclass.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
