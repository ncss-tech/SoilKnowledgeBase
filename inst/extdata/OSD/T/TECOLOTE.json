  "OVERVIEW": "The Tecolote series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed mainly in material weathered from felsite. Tecolote soils are on sideslopes, backslopes, and toeslopes of mountains and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 1 to 4 inches. (A horizon)\nAlbic horizon: 4 to 13 inches. (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 30 to 46 inches. (Bt horizon)\nType location was moved from Lincoln County, NM to El Paso County, CO on 5/01.  The series range was narrowed to MLRAs 48A and 49. It is unclear whether the historical climax plant community at the type location includes Douglas-fir or whether it is only ponderosa pine. At the El Paso County type location there is no pinyon-juniper vegetation, which was on the original type location in New Mexico; this is now outside the series concept. The moisture regime subclass is left as typic ustic on the 11/2007 revision, but if it can be verified that this series typically has a Douglas-fir climax plant community, the classification will likely be updated to a Udic subgroup, udic ustic moisture subclass.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
