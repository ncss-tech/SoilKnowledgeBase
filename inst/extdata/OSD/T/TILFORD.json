  "OVERVIEW": "The Tilford series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in local alluvium and residuum derived from reddish siltstone and silty shale.  Tilford soils are on on backslopes and footslopes of fans, terraces, and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 445 mm (17.5 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
