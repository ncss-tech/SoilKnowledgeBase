    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 69 to 72 degrees F. These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 80 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. Salinity ranges from moderate to strong, electrical conductivity ranges from 3.5 to 40.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 5 to 40. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent. Organic matter content decreases irregularly or remains above 0.35 percent to a depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak thin platy, weak fine granular or weak medium subangular blocky structure and is single grained in some pedons This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy clay loam, clay loam or light silty clay loam. The control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. It is moderately to strongly alkaline."

Binton soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section. Jocity soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and moist value of 4 or 5. San Mateo soils are moist more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  and the surface soils are 1 to 3 units darker in value. Drum soils have calcic horizons. Yuba soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Boysen soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of 8 percent or less, are highly stratified, and are mainly 1 unit value darker in color. Youngstown and Lostwells soils have less than 1 percent exchangeable sodium."
