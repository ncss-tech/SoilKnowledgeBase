  "OVERVIEW": "The Tadina series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable upland soils that formed in thick sandy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to undulating terraces of the Brazos, Colorado, and Navasota Rivers and their tributaries.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Similar soils include the Arenosa, Faula, Nimrod, and Stidham series.  Catilla soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite in the Bt horizon.  Desan soils do not have redoximorphic features with chromas of 2 or less in the Bt horizon.  Matilo soils have a paralithic contact between 60 and 80 inches.  Navasan soils are moderately well drained and have a water table between 3 and 5 feet.  Padina soils developed in Tertiary age sediments.  Patilo soils are dry in the moisture control section for slightly longer periods and, in addition, Patilo soils are moderately well drained.  Plains soils have sola between 60 and 80 inches thick and have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 59 to 64 degrees F.  In addition, Plains soils occur in areas that receive significantly less precipitation.  Arenosa soils do not have Bt horizons.  Faula soils have Bt horizons with lamellae.  Nimrod and Stidham soils have A horizons less than 40 inches thick."
