Similar soils include the Arenosa, Faula, Nimrod, and Stidham series.  Catilla soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite in the Bt horizon.  Desan soils do not have redoximorphic features with chromas of 2 or less in the Bt horizon.  Matilo soils have a paralithic contact between 60 and 80 inches.  Navasan soils are moderately well drained and have a water table between 3 and 5 feet.  Padina soils developed in Tertiary age sediments.  Patilo soils are dry in the moisture control section for slightly longer periods and, in addition, Patilo soils are moderately well drained.  Plains soils have sola between 60 and 80 inches thick and have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 59 to 64 degrees F.  In addition, Plains soils occur in areas that receive significantly less precipitation.  Arenosa soils do not have Bt horizons.  Faula soils have Bt horizons with lamellae.  Nimrod and Stidham soils have A horizons less than 40 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tadina soils are on terraces of the Colorado, Brazos, and Navasota Rivers and their tributaries.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent, with concave and convex surfaces.  The soil formed in thick sandy beds of alluvium that appear to have been reworked somewhat by wind.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F; and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches.  Frost free days range from 240 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 150 to 300 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 54 to 64."
