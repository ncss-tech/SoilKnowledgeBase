  "OVERVIEW": "The Truce series consists of soils that are deep over claystone bedrock. These well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loamy colluvium and/or slope alluvium over clayey residuum derived from claystone of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on gently sloping to steep, convex ridges. Slopes are typically 1 to 5 percent, but range from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

Climax vegetation is an open post oak savannah with tall and mid grasses such as indiangrass, big and little bluestem, and sideoats grama. Most areas contain other woody plants such as blackjack oak and elm with invading mesquite, cedar, and lotebush. Present herbaceous vegetation consists mainly of sideoats grama, Texas needlegrass, hairy grama, threeawns, sand dropseed, and other low producing perennials and annuals with western ragweed, Engelmann-daisy, bundleflower, prairie clover, primrose, and gayfeather."
