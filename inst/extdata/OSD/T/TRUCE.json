Climax vegetation is an open post oak savannah with tall and mid grasses such as indiangrass, big and little bluestem, and sideoats grama. Most areas contain other woody plants such as blackjack oak and elm with invading mesquite, cedar, and lotebush. Present herbaceous vegetation consists mainly of sideoats grama, Texas needlegrass, hairy grama, threeawns, sand dropseed, and other low producing perennials and annuals with western ragweed, Engelmann-daisy, bundleflower, prairie clover, primrose, and gayfeather."
