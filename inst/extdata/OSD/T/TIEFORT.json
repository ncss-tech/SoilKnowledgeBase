Blind (T), Bluebird (T), Pinaleno, Soledad, and Topawa soils receive summer precipitation.  Ashmed soils have control sections characterized by more than 60 percent rock fragments.  Bitter, Nellake and Timosea soils are deep and very deep, respectively.  In addition Bitter soils have C horizons of very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly or very cobbly sand.  Highland soils are deeper to a lithic contact, and have a layer characterized by secondary silica accumulation."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tiefort soils are on mountains.  Slope ranges from 30 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from dominantly extrusive volcanic rock.  Elevations are 3,000 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm winters.  Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 59 to 66 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F. and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days."
