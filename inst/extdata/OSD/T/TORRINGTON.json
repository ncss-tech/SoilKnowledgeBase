  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "JWW/MCS",
  "REVDATE": "08/2002",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Torrington series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and eolian deposits derived from noncalcareous sandstone.  These soils are on nearly level and undulating hillslopes, tablelands, benches, and terraces. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Torrington soils are typically noncalcareous, but some pedons may contain few segregated masses of lime above the bedrock.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 10 to 31 inches.  Rock fragments are typically 0 to 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  These soils are usually dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section for more than 90 days between June 30 and October 30 in most years.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe AB or BA horizon, when present, has the same range in characteristics as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures include very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent sand, with greater than 15 percent being fine or coarser.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand with less than 15 percent clay."

They formed in residuum and eolian materials derived from noncalcareous fine grained sandstone. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Elevations are 4500 to 5500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow in April, May, and June. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 105 to 135 days."
