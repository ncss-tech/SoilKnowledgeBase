  "REVDATE": "08/2017",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tobosa series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived from limestone. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on dissected plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 558 mm (22 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
