  "OVERVIEW": "The Turnerville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick, weakly calcareous eolian silts that have been partially reworked by water in some areas. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: In some pedons the E1 horizon is discontinuous. The solum ranges from 30 to 60 or more inches thick. Usually these soils are noncalcareous to depths in excess of 60 inches but are weakly and inconsistently calcareous below depths of 40 inches in some pedons. Organic carbon in the surface horizons ranges from .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with depth. The soil is 60 to 100 percent base-saturated. Rock fragments are usually less than 3 percent and range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F.\nThe E2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has thick platy structure but it has granular or fine subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silty clay loam or silt loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon usually has subangular blocky structure but has very weak prismatic structure in some pedons. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It is neutral or slightly alkaline."

The soils formed in thick, weakly calcareous, eolian silts that have been partly reworked by water in places. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation in most months. Mean annual air temperature is about 30 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 50 to 75 days."
