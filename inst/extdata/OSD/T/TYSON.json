Tyson soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between the depths of 5 and 15 inches is dry in all parts from June to October and is moist in all parts from November to May.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is less than 50 percent in some part.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/2, or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 2/2, 3/2, or 3/3.  The A horizon is gravelly or very gravelly loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and 20 to 60 percent coarse fragments.  It is neutral through moderately acid and becomes more acid with depth.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 45 to 85 percent.  The AB horizon, where present, has higher chroma, and is more acid with lower base saturation than the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, or 6/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 4/2, or 4/4.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.  It is moderately acid through very strongly acid.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 40 to 60 percent."

The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, with about 10 to 30 inches of snow.  Mean January temperature is 40 degrees F; mean July temperature is 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 110 to 250 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (A, AB horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 24 inches (Bw horizon)\nTyson soils were formerly classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Ultic Haploxerolls.  Further investigation in Lake and Mendocino counties found that base saturation (ammonium acetate) was less than 50 percent.  The Tyson soil as published in the Mendocino National Forest Area report has base saturation (ammonium acetate) less than 50 percent, but appears to be Pachic and would be outside the series as now defined.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
