  "STATES": "CO,ID,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Targhee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from rhyolitic tuff, gneiss, granite, or basalt rock sources.  These soils are on mountain slopes and landslides.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
