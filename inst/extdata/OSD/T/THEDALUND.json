  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 79 degrees F.  Normally, these soils are calcareous throughout but they are leached for a few inches in some pedons.  Some visible secondary calcium carbonate occurs inconsistently and at variable depths.  The particle size control section is generally loam or light clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 55 percent and sand from 15 to 50 percent with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The horizon is usually granular but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.  It is mildly alkaline or strongly alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.5).\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is loam or clay loam with more than 18 percent clay.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6) and contains 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Shavano soils have a lithic contact between a depth of 20 and 40 inches, Sixmile soils have hue of 5YR or redder."

The soils formed in thick calcareous alluvial fan materials derived from sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F."
