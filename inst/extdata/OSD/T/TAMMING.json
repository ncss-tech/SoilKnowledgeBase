  "OVERVIEW": "The Tamming series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess, and slope alluvium, and colluvium from basalt and some volcanic ash.  Tamming soils are on south facing canyon walls and mountainsides and have slopes of 30 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent angular basalt fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 25 inches thick.  The A horizon is 6 to 15 inches thick.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The A2 horizon is cobbly silt loam, very gravelly silt loam, or very cobbly silt loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  The fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam and is very gravelly, very cobbly, or cobbly.\nThe 2Bt2 & 2Bt3 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.
