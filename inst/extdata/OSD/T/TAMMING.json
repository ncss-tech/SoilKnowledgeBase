    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to basalt is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent angular basalt fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 25 inches thick.  The A horizon is 6 to 15 inches thick.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The A2 horizon is cobbly silt loam, very gravelly silt loam, or very cobbly silt loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  The fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam and is very gravelly, very cobbly, or cobbly.\nThe 2Bt2 & 2Bt3 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is very gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in loess, colluvium and slope alluvium from basalt and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Elevation ranges from 1,800 to 4,000 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F and the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F.  Mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 125 days."
