  "OVERVIEW": "The Tamaneen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or glaciofluvial deposits. These soils are on stream terraces, relict stream terraces, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
