  "OVERVIEW": "The Tolby series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in coarse textured stony colluvium from acid igneous rocks. These soils are on convex mountain slopes with slopes ranging from 25 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
