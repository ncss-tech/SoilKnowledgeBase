Often, as a result, the permafrost and the water table will drop below the series control section.\nTanacross is the Alaska State Soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory data S04AK-068-003 from Denali Borough, Alaska, samples by SSL Lincoln, NE, 07/04\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
