  "OVERVIEW": "The Turnercrest soils consist of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in eolian or alluvium deposits and residuum derived from soft sandstone.  They are on bedrock-controlled hills, fan remnants, ridges and structural benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to soft, calcareous sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are typically calcareous throughout but may be leached as much as to 6 inches in some pedons.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or warmer and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days. The particle-size control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 7 to 18 percent clay and 52 to 80 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos throughout the soil.  Rock fragments may be present but break down on pretreatment and do not have lithic properties.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5  moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Depth to the base of the Bw horizon is less than 10 inches.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Some pedons have thin layers of loamy fine sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has a paralithic contact to soft, calcareous sandstone.  The sandstone has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y."
