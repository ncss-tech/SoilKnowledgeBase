  "OVERVIEW": "The Takpochao series consists of very shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on limestone plateaus, sideslopes and escarpments. They formed in sediments overlying coralline limestone.  Slopes range from 3 to 99 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 87 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Takpochao soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus, often adjacent to the coast, and are on side slopes and escarpments of limestone plateaus.  The limestone is derived from a coral reef complex. They formed in residual and colluvial sediments, possibly with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 3 to 99 percent.  Elevation is 16 to 1,529 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. variation between summer and winter.  Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 90 inches, most of which falls between June and November."
