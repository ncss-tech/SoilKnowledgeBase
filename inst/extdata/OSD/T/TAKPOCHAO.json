  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Takpochao soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus, often adjacent to the coast, and are on side slopes and escarpments of limestone plateaus.  The limestone is derived from a coral reef complex. They formed in residual and colluvial sediments, possibly with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 3 to 99 percent.  Elevation is 16 to 1,529 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. variation between summer and winter.  Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 90 inches, most of which falls between June and November."
