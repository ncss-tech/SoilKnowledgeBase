Blackmagic and Dona Ana soils contain 5 to 15 percent rock fragment in the PSCS. Berino and Mcnew soils contain 0 to 5 percent rock fragment in the PSCS.  Brenda soils have gravelly coarse sand in the lower part of the profile below the argillic horizon. Cornville soils have calcic horizon at 25 to 32 inches depth. Hap soils have 2.5YR hues. Hap, Kidwell and Mohave soils are noneffervescent in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Blackmagic, Jagerson, Kidwell, Lanip and Poachie soils receive most of the precipitation in the winter are moist for less than 20 days cumulative in the summer and occur in MLRA 30. Poachie soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the PSCS. Cornville, Hap, Madurez, soils are not calcareous through out the pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on alluvial fans and footslopes of large hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in gravelly coarse to moderately fine textured alluvium derived mainly from igneous rocks.  The climate is arid continental.  Elevations range 1,800 to 5,900 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches and there is a marked summer maximum.  The average annual temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 14.  The frost free season is 180 to 230 days."

Black grama, bush muhly, and tobosa are the principal grasses and most areas have large amounts of creosotebush and/or tarbush and some mesquite, yucca, and cacti.  In some areas where water is available and slope permits these soils are irrigated and cultivated.  Small grains and cotton are the main crops."
