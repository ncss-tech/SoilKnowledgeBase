  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toecane soils are along drainageways, on benches and fans, and in coves in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., the frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges from 46 to 64 inches. Elevation ranges from 1,500 to 4,800 feet. Slope ranges from 2 to 95 percent, but is dominantly 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered primarily from felsic high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks such as metagraywacke, gneiss, schist, and granite."

Ashe, Buladean, Cashiers, Chandler, Chestnut, Cleveland, Edneytown, Edneyville, Evard, Fannin, Huntdale, Micaville, Plott, Pigeonroost, Saluda, Trimont, Unaka and Watauga soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, have C horizons of saprolite, and are on locally higher summits and side slopes. Greenlee soils do not have A horizons with value of 3 or less that are thicker than 6 inches. Saunook soils are in a fine-loamy family and have an argillic horizon. Tusquitee soils are in a coarse-loamy family. Cullasaja, Haywood, and Tuckasegee soils have umbric epipedons. Sylva soils are poorly drained and Whiteside soils are moderately well drained. In addition, Sylva and Whiteside soils are on less-sloping colluvial positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid in the lower part. Surface runoff is very low on gentle slopes where the forest litter has not been disturbed and medium or high on very steep slopes where litter has been removed. The seasonal high water table is greater than 6 feet throughout most of the year. These soils receive surface and subsurface water from surrounding uplands and seeps and springs are common."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Toecane soils are used for woodland. Native species include yellow-poplar, eastern hemlock, yellow birch, sweet birch, northern red oak, black cherry, red maple, Fraser magnolia and cucumbertree. At elevations above 4,000 feet yellow birch replaces yellow-poplar as a common tree. Common understory plants include rhododendron, striped maple, serviceberry, Carolina silverbell, trillium, hay scented fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, woodfern, and New York fern. Some of the less stony or bouldery areas are used for pasture."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Toecane soils are associated with residual soils that are on relatively stable landscapes. These soils were formerly included with the Cullasaja or Greenlee series. Cullasaja soils have an umbric epipedon and Greenlee have an ochric epipedon and lack the umbric intergrade property.\nParticle-size analysis of the fine-earth fraction of three pedons of Toecane indicate the clay content of the Bt horizons commonly range from about 15 to 25 percent. Most pedons have clay content that doubles from the eluvial horizon (AE) to the illuvial horizon (Bt). Weighted average clay content from a depth of 10 to 40 inches ranges from about 12 to 18 percent.\nThe 7/98 revision places this soil in active CEC activity class. Class placement is based on similar soils in the region\nsuch as Thunder, Edneyville and Edneytown.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nHumic feature - zone from soil surface to 8 inches (A and E horizons) with moist value of 3 or less and dry value of 5 or less.\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (A and AE horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 30 inches (Bt and BC horizons).\nLoamy-skeletal feature - average content of more than 35 percent by volume rock fragments in the particle-size control section (8 to 28 inch depth).\nSIR = NC0228\nMLRA = 130\nRevised: 9/94-BPS,JAK; 10/95-BPS,JAK; 9/96-BPS,DHK; 7/98-DHK; 3/03-MKC\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from North Carolina State University, Department of Soil Science, Raleigh, NC for the following pedons: S92NC-199-008.\nNASIS Data Map Unit ID: NASIS data for the typical pedon in Yancey County, NC are represented by DMU ID # 370233.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
