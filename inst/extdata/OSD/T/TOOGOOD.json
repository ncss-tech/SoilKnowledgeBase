  "OVERVIEW": "The Toogood series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sand and gravel deposits. These soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
