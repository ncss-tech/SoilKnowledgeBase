Esplin, Pastern, Pastura, and Rolie soils do not have bedrock within 60 inches of the surface. Promontory soils have rhyolite bedrock below the hardpan.

These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations. Elevations range from 4500 to 6000 feet. The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. The frost-free period is 150 to 165 days."
