  "OVERVIEW": "The Terro series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to soft bedrock.  They formed on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, fan remnants, terraces and plateaus in residuum, alluvium, colluvial slopewash or eolian materials derived primarily from soft sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments as channers range from 0 to 10 percent.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma 1 to 3.  It has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with clay ranging from 10 to 18 percent.  Oriented clay occurs as bridges holding mineral grains together.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate is 0 to 4 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is soft calcareous sandstone or sandstone interbedded with shale."
