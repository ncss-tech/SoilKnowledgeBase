The soils formed in material mainly of diatomaceous earth, volcanic ash, and  alluvium. Tisch soils are in subhumid to humid climates having cool relatively dry summers and mild moist  winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches. Mean January temperature is 40 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 160 days."
