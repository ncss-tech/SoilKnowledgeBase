  "OVERVIEW": "The Tohobit series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid below.  Slopes  are 0 to 4 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
