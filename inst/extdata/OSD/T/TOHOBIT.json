Bartonflat soils have sand and gravel at 3 to 12 inches and lack a water table.  Bromaglin soils are noncalcareous to below 7 inches and lack a water table.  Bursteadt soils are on valley flats and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Dawtonia soils are on fan terraces, lack mollic epipedons and have argillic horizons.  Zer soils are on fan terraces, are well drained and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections."
