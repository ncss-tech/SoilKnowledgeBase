  "BYREV": "Rev. TES/KFS/LWH",
  "REVDATE": "12/2008",
  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Toldohn series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium from shale and sandstone. The Toldohn soils are on escarpments and sideslopes of mesas, cuestas, ridges, breaks, and hills. Slope is 8 to 40 percent. The mean average precipitation is 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
