  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toldohn soils are on escarpments and sideslopes of mesas, cuestas, ridges, breaks and hills. Elevation is 6,800 to 8,000 feet. These soils formed in slope alluvium from sandstone and shale. Slope is 8 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches which occurs as intense summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rain or snow. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
