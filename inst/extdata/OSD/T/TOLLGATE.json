  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F.  Tollgate soils are usually dry and are dry for about 50 to 70 consecutive days in late summer.  The soils are moist for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the spring and early summer.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 14 inches thick and the solum thickness is 30 to 50 inches.  Strongly contrasting textures or bedrock are at depth greater than 40 inches.  The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is gravelly or cobbly loam or clay loam with 15 to 50 percent rounded and angular rock fragments.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction, has 18 to 35 percent clay, and has 35 to 50 percent angular or rounded rock fragments by volume.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The C horizon commonly contains 40 to 75 percent angular or rounded rock fragments and loamy interstitial material.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Ashue soils have contrasting very gravelly or cobbly sand below a depth of 30 inches.  Babbington soils have sola 15 to 22 inches thick and have calcareous material at depths ranging from 15 to 22 inches.  Badenaugh soils are slightly or medium acid in the lower part.  Collard soils have sola 20 to 27 inches thick above very cobbly loamy sand.  Haw soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Searles soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Shroe soils have more than 35 percent clay in the B2t horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tollgate soils are on nearly level to steep alluvial and colluvial fans and mountain footslopes at elevations of 2,700 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes of 3 to 15 percent are most common and range up o about 45 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from rhyollitic and similar acid igneous rock sources.  The climate is semiarid and summers are relatively dry.  The average frost free season is 90 to 140 days and the mean annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches including 1 to 4 feet of snow."
