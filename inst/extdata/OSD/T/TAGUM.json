  "OVERVIEW": "The Tagum series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Tagum soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
