These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,380 to 2,870 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
