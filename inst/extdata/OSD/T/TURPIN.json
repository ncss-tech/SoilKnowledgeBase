  "OVERVIEW": "The Turpin series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks.  Turpin soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
