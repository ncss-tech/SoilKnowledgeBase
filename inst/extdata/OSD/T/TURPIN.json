    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Turpin soils are on lake terraces.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks with surface mantles of eolian material.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,495 meters.  The climate is arid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
