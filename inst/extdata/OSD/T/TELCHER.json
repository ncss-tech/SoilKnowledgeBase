Uncoated silt grains are common on surfaces of peds in the lower A and upper B horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value of 3 through 5, and moist chroma of 3 through 6. It is clay loam, gravelly clay loam , or silty clay loam and contains from 5 to 35 percent gravel by volume. This horizon has a clay increase of about 1.4 times that of the eluvial horizons and has clay films on both vertical and horizontal faces of peds and in some pores."
