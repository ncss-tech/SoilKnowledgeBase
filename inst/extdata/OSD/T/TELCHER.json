  "OVERVIEW": "The Telcher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt or other volcanic rocks. Telcher soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
