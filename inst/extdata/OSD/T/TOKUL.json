The classification was not changed, but the OSD was reformatted and English units were converted to metric units. Laboratory data indicates that the andic soil properties may not always extend to the cemented till and a strongly contrasting particle-size class may be warranted. Further field investigation and laboratory sampling is recommended. The cementing agents in the 2Bsm horizon also require additional investigation. In some historic surveys that included the Tokul series, this material was recognized as ortstein.\n12/2015--This OSD was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting; no major technical changes were made."
