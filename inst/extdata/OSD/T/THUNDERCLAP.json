  "OVERVIEW": "The Thunderclap series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium over residuum weathered from granitoid and gneissic rock. Thunderclap soils are on fan aprons over pediments. Slopes range from 4 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 200 millimeters (8 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",

Cinco soils have effervescence in the A horizon and average 15 to 35 percent fine gravel in the control section. Pilotwell soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 centimeters) to a paralithic contact. Inyo, Wheelridge and Whitewolf soils do not have bedrock within two meters. In addition, Inyo soils are formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits and Wheelridge soils have strongly or violently effervescent Bk horizons."
