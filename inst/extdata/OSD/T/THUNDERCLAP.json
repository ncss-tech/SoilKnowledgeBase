  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cinco (CA), Inyo (CA), Pilotwell (CA), Wheelridge (CA) and Whitewolf (CA) series. Cinco soils have effervescence in the A horizon and average 15 to 35 percent fine gravel in the control section. Pilotwell soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 centimeters) to a paralithic contact. Inyo, Wheelridge and Whitewolf soils do not have bedrock within two meters. In addition, Inyo soils are formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits and Wheelridge soils have strongly or violently effervescent Bk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thunderclap soils are on fan aprons over pediment. Slopes range from 4 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium over residuum weathered from granitoid and gneissic rock. Elevation ranges from 1,370 to 1,750 meters (4,495 to 5,740 feet). The climate is arid bordering on xeric with warm, dry summers, and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 250 millimeters (7 to 10 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees C (55 to 63 degrees F). The frost-free season is 210 to 270 days."
