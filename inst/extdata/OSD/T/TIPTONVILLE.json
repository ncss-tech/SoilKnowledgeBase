    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 35 to 65 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness.  Reaction in the A and C horizon is moderately acid to neutral and the B horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Iron depletions of chroma 2 or less are present within 40 inches of the soil surface.  The texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  Pedons that are loam or clay loam have a significant amount of very fine sandy.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Iron depletions and concentrations are in shades of gray and brown.  The texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam and is stratified with a variety of textures below about 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Deepwater is the only other series in this family.  Deepwater soils formed in a thin mantle of loess over residuum from shale on uplands.  Soils in closely associated families are the Caspiana, Catoosa, Dardanelle, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, and Reelfoot soils.  Caspiana, Catoosa, Dardanelle, Lula soils do not have iron depletions and are not saturated within 40 inches of the soil surface for a significant period.  Catoosa soils also have bedrock within 40 inches of the soil surface and Lula soils have bedrock within 60 inches.   Mason soils are not saturated in the upper 40 inches and have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick.  Mer Rouge soils formed in calcarous alluvium and are not saturated in the upper 40 inches.  Reelfoot soils are wetter and have iron depletions of chroma 2 or less within 16 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tiptonville soils formed in silty alluvium on stream terraces which are old natural levees of the Mississippi River.  These soils occupy some of the higher better drained sites on these ridges.  They also formed in silty colluvium at the foot of the loess bluff.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  At the type location average precipitation is about 49 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F."
