    "content": "REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Sauz series.  The series is separated based on the surface being calcareous and the absence of an argillic horizon.  Classification changed from Aeric Halaquepts to Typic Halaquepts 02/1997 based on colors of typifying pedon and series array.  Classification change 02/2003 added activity class.  Classification change 03/2005 activity class changed from active to semiactive based on lab data from the typifying pedon S88TX-261-005.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (Bkng1, Bkng2 and Bkng3 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (Anz1 and Anz2 horizons)\nCambic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bknz1, Bknz2, Bknz3, 2Bnzg1, 2Bnzg2 and 3Bknzg horizons)\nAquic Conditions: Reducing conditions occur during those periods when these soils are ponded.\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bknzg1 horizon, at the upper boundary of the 3Bknzg horizon; based on contrasting particle sizes.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU data from type location in Kenedy County, TX (S88TX-261-005).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
