The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Depth of the paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to the 2Bt horizon is 14 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and 50 to 60 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral throughout.  There is an absolute increase in clay of 20 to 30 percent between the A2 and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure and 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist and dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Structure is subangular or angular blocky to columnar.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  The upper part is silty clay or clay with 50 to 60 percent clay.  The lower part is clay, clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 60 percent clay."
