  "OVERVIEW": "The Tutuilla series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from meta-sedimentary material mixed with loess in the upper part.  Tutuilla soils are in basins and on side slopes and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Depth of the paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to the 2Bt horizon is 14 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and 50 to 60 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral throughout.  There is an absolute increase in clay of 20 to 30 percent between the A2 and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure and 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist and dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Structure is subangular or angular blocky to columnar.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  The upper part is silty clay or clay with 50 to 60 percent clay.  The lower part is clay, clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 60 percent clay."

Pomponio soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to shale.  Pritchard soils are mildly alkaline in the subsoil."
