  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Thornock soils are on loess-mantled basalt plains. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess and material weathered from basalt.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  Average annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 56 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 140 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,000 to 4,800 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kimama and Portneuf soils and the competing Portino and Trevino soils. Kimama soils are fine-silty, have argillic horizons, and are greater than 60 inches deep.  Portneuf soils are coarse-silty and are greater than 60 inches deep. Kimama soils are in depressional areas on basalt plains.  Portneuf and Portino soils are in areas on basalt plains where the deposits overlying the basalt are thicker.  Trevino soils are on basalt plains in areas of thinner loess deposits over the bedrock."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Thornock soils were previously classified as Lithic Xerollic Calciorthids.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 6 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 15 inches (Bk horizon)\nLithic contact - the contact with basalt at 15 inches (2R)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 15 inches (part of the Bk horizon).  In some pedons it encompasses the entire soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
