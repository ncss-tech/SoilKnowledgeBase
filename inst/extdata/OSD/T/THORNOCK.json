  "OVERVIEW": "The Thornock series consists of shallow, well drained soils  that formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess and material weathered from basalt.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Average annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 56 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 140 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,000 to 4,800 feet."

Kimama soils are fine-silty, have argillic horizons, and are greater than 60 inches deep.  Portneuf soils are coarse-silty and are greater than 60 inches deep. Kimama soils are in depressional areas on basalt plains.  Portneuf and Portino soils are in areas on basalt plains where the deposits overlying the basalt are thicker.  Trevino soils are on basalt plains in areas of thinner loess deposits over the bedrock."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Thornock soils were previously classified as Lithic Xerollic Calciorthids.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 6 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 15 inches (Bk horizon)\nLithic contact - the contact with basalt at 15 inches (2R)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 15 inches (part of the Bk horizon).  In some pedons it encompasses the entire soil."
