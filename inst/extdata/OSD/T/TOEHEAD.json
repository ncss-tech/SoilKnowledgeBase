  "OVERVIEW": "The Toehead series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from limestone, quartzite, sandstone and shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 61 degrees F.  In more than 7 out of 10 years the soils are moist in all parts of the moisture control section about 55 percent of the time soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F., and are moist for 65 to 75 consecutive days during the 120 days after the winter solstice.\nThe A and Bw horizons have a value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  This horizon is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline."
