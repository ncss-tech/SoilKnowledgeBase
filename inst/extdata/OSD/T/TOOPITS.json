  "OVERVIEW": "The Toopits series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Toopits soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
