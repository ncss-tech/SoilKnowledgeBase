  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuffit series includes dark moderately fine Solonetz soils of the glacial lake and stream terraces and gentle fan slopes in intermountain valleys in the Northern Rocky Mountains.  Their parent materials are derived from gray, green and reddish argillites of the Belt geological formation.  These soils occupy nearly flat, undulating and slightly depressed positions, and, in the lower places, receive some runoff from associated higher-lying soils.  They differ from the Demers soils in that they have darker surface soils and heavier surface and upper subsoil layers.  They are not so thoroughly leached of their lime carbonates in the upper part of their solum as Demers soils.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Within areas of these soils are soils in all stages of salinization and Solonetz development.  Little degradation of the clays, however, is apparent.  Bare or slick \"blowout\" spots common to Solonetz soils in higher better drained positions are rare in these soils.  Areas of these soils adjacent to or contiguous with till uplands may be underlain by till at a depth of 2 to 4 feet."
