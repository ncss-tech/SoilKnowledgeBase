    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon has more than 6 percent organic carbon. Gravel content in the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 80 percent, with 30 to 65 percent gravel and 5 to 40 percent cobble. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F. Reaction of the profile ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nAn A horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR to 5Y, value from 3 to 6, and chroma from 1 to 2.  Texture is commonly very fine sandy loam, but ranges to include silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma from 0 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges to include very fine sandy loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and loam.\nThe Bs horizons have hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 5, and chroma from 2 to 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges to include fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, and silt loam.\nA C horizon is present in some pedons."

Hydaburg and Sunnyhay are shallow organic soils occupying alpine landscapes.  Karta and Wadleigh soils are developed in till. McGilvery soils consist of forest litter over bedrock.  St. Nicholas soils are poorly drained.  Tonowek and Tuxekan soils are deep, formed from alluvium, and occur on river and stream terraces."
