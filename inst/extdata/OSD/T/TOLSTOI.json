  "OVERVIEW": "The Tolstoi series consists of shallow to bedrock, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum on gently sloping to extremely steep shoulders and backslopes of mountains and valleysides. Slopes range from 5 to 120 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F. Reaction of the profile ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nAn A horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR to 5Y, value from 3 to 6, and chroma from 1 to 2.  Texture is commonly very fine sandy loam, but ranges to include silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma from 0 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges to include very fine sandy loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and loam.\nThe Bs horizons have hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 5, and chroma from 2 to 6.
