  "OVERVIEW": "The Tranquillity series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, saline-sodic soils on low-lying alluvial fans and flood plains.  It formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rock.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, the mean annual air temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 245 to 255 days.",
