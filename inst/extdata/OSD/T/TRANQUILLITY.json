    "content": "REMARKS:  Previously mapped as Oxalis series in the Soil Survey of the Mendota Area, California, Series 1940, No. 18.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMAJOR DIAGNOSTIC HORIZONS:\n1. OCHRIC EPIPEDON--0 to 16 inches (Apl, Ap2,). 1.1  Moist colors have values greater than 3.5.\nOTHER DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS:\n1.  VERTISOL FEATURES 1.1  Unless irrigated, vertical cracks extend from the surface and range from 0.5 to 2 inches wide at a depth of 20 inches. 1.2  The typical pedon, which was cultivated and irrigated, had cracks to a depth of 21 inches.  The cracks usually close from December thru April for 100 to 151 consecutive days.  1.4  COLE values range from 0.13 to 0.14 cm/cm in the typical pedon. 1.5  Common intersecting slickensides occur in the typical pedon from 16 to 48 inches.\n2.  FINE FAMILY 2.1  NSSL results show 48 to 53 percent clay in the typical pedon. There is 52 percent clay from 10 to 40 inches.\n3.  SMECTITIC MINERALOGY 3.1  NSSL results show a predominance of smectite.  Cracking and fine particle size class are further evidence of the mineralogy.\n4.  THERMIC TEMPERATURE REGIME 4.1  Soil temperature regime is assumed to be thermic based upon data from Helm, CA (about 20 miles SE of typical site). 4.2  Based on two soil temperature sites 18 and 24 miles SE of the typical site with 3 years of quarterly data.  Soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.\n5.  PRECIPITATION\n5.1 MAP is about 8 inches based upon data from Mendota Dam, CA (MAP 7.7 inches about 5 miles N of the typical pedon).\n6.  SODIC SUBGROUP\n6.1  Tranquillity soils have, in one or more horizons within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface, an exchangeable sodium percentage of 15 or more (or a sodium adsorption ratio of 13 or more) for 6 or more months per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.\n6.2  In some pedons the Ap horizon is not saline-sodic due to reclamation practices.\nThe moisture control section data are as follows:\nJ   F   M   A   M   J   J   A   S   O   N   D MONTHS:   ]...]...]...]...]...]...]...]...]...]...]...]...]\nCRACKS    ]...]...]...]...]<-------214 DAYS---------->]...] OPEN\nCRACKS      ----151 DAYS-->]...........................]<-- CLOSED\nEXCEEDS 47 DEGREES F.\n[<------------------365 DAYS------------------->]\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data sample numbers 86P3123-3127 for the typical pedon.
