  "OVERVIEW": "The Twinbuttes series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in Tephra.  Twinbuttes soils are on cindercones and in pockets between lava flows.  Slope is 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
