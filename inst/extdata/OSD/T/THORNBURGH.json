    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 54 to 59 degrees F.  The solum ranges from 16 to 32 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 15 inches thick.  Channers or pebbles and angular or rounded cobbles with some stones range from 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section and C horizon.  The fine earth fraction of the particle-size control section is typically a loam but ranges to a sandy loam in the C horizon.  Clay ranges from 10 to 20 percent, silt from 10 to 40 percent, and sand from 35 to 75 percent.  Contrasting material or bedrock is at depths below 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is 5 to 20 percent channers or gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.   It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very channery or very cobbly loam, sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is very channery or very cobbly to extremely cobbly sandy loam, very channery loam, or very cobbly loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

Antrobus, Handran, and Midelight soils lack a cambic horizon Basinpeak soils have mean annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F.  and lack Bw horizons.  Fairydell soils are calcareous below the A horizon and have horizons of carbonate accumulations.  Foxmount, Grafen, Rockabin, and Supervisor soils have bedrock at a depth ranging from 20 to 40 inches.  Broad Canyon soils have sand and gravel substrata at a depth ranging from 20 to 40 inches.  Kamack soils have an O horizon 6 inches thick.  Farlow, Greyback, Silvercliff, Teemat, and Tiban soils have a continuous Ck horizon.  Decram, Krackle, Middlehill, and Parachute soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Gaia soils lack Bw horizons and have lamellae in the C horizon.  Klug soils have lime carbonate as pendants on coarse fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Lag soils lack channers but have dominantly gravel (70 to 95 percent) in the Bw and C horizons.  Fairydell soils have a Cqk horizon.  Maurice soils have mean annual soil temperature of 42 to 46 degrees F., have cambic horizons extending deeper than 40 inches, and have elevations of 4,000 to 7,000 feet.  Midfork soils are uniformly calcareous at a depth of 4 to 15 inches below the surface.  Antrobus and Sebud soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the finer-than-2mm fraction of the particle-size control section.  McCort soils have hues of 5YR in the lower cambic and C horizons.  Sup soils have mean annual soil temperatures warmer than 42 degrees F. and moderately acid soil reaction in the C horizon.  Sup soils are noncalcareous throughout and have moderately or slightly acid soil reactions.  Surdal soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Timmercrek soils have 65 to 85 percent rock fragments in the texture control section, and have lamellae in the C horizon.  Tineman soils have a horizon of gravelly sand or loamy sand in the lower part of the control section.  Wareagle soils have mean annual soil temperatures lower than 38 degrees F."
