It is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days between December and April, but the soil temperatures are below 5 degrees C during this period.  The moisture regime is Aridic but it borders on Xeric.\nSoil temperature:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.\nRock fragments:  15 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Some soil horizons have up to 45 percent gravel but the control section is less than 35 percent.\nDepth to bedrock:  10 to 20 inches to soft, fractured metasedimentary rock; 20 to 50 inches to hard fractured rock.\nReaction:  slightly acid or neutral\nA horizon\nHue:  10YR or 7.5YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma:  2 or 3, moist or dry\nTexture:  gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam\nClay:  10 to 22 percent\nOrganic matter:  1 to 2 percent\nB horizon\nHue:  10YR or 7.5YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma:  3 or 4, moist or dry\nTexture:  gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam or very\ngravelly loam\nClay:  18 to 30 percent"

These soils formed in material weathered from hard, fractured metasedimentary rock.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, mostly as winter snow.  Mean annual snowfall is 75 to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 39 to 47 degrees F.

Much of the acreage of this soil was chained in the 1960's  in an attempt to convert the vegetation from pinyon woodland into range grassland.  Natural potential plant community is mainly singleleaf pinyon with some western juniper, big sagebrush and desert bitterbrush."
