  "OVERVIEW": "The Tibbcreek series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountain plateaus and broad ridgetops.  These soils formed in material weathered from highly fractured metasedimentary rock.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
