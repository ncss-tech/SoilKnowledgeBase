  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 90 to 150 cm.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 100 to 150 cm.  Depth to hard bedrock is 180 cm or more.  Content of coarse fragments is 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the B horizon and 2 to 35 percent in the lower part of the B horizon, and 20 to 60 percent in the C.  Coarse fragments consist of angular red shale and rounded quartzite.  The soil is medium to very strongly acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6 except A1 horizons less than 10 cm thick commonly have value and chroma less than 4.  It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Hue of 5YR is restricted to the upper part of the B horizon.  The B horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or shaly analogues of these textures.  The particle-size control section averages more than 30 percent silt.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is shaly or very shaly analogues of silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay."

Albertville and Mattaponi soils have a B horizon in hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Badin soils contain slate fragments in the solum and C horizon.  Bengal and Brockroad soils have a lithologic discontinuity within 125 cm.  Bonvier and Kirvin soils contain fragments dominated by ironstone.  Catharpin soils have a lithologic discontinuity within 130 cm.  Carnasaw, Enders, Endsaw and Remlap soils have high shrink-swell.  Cullen, Fluvanna, Masada, McQueen and Urland soils do not contain coarse fragments of shale.  Cunningham, Cuthbert, Galilee and Townley soils have a paralithic or lithic contact within 100 cm.  Gritney soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part of the B horizon.  Luverne, Sweatman and Tatum soils contain flakes of mica.  Nason and Vance soils have B horizons in hue of 5YR or yellower.  Williamsville soils have a solum that range in thickness from 150 to 200 cm."

The soils formed in residuum weathered from red shale of Triassic age.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 15 degrees to 18 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 104 to 113 cm."

Creedmoor soils are along drainageways and in basins and have a mottled heavy clay argillic horizon.  Klinesville soils are on sloping to very steep slopes and have bedrock at a depth of 50 cm or less.  Manassas soils are along drainageways, in depressions, and on footslopes.  They have a fine-loamy particle size control sections.  Mayodan, Penn and Rapidan soils are on similar landscape positions as Totier soils.  Mayodan soils have a lighter colored surface horizon and have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Penn soils have a solum less than 90 cm thick.  Rapidan soils have dark reddish brown or dark red colors throughout the solum."
