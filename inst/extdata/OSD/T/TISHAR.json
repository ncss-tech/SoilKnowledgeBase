The soils are usually moist and dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the 120-period following the summer solstice.  The solum thickness and depth to soft bedrock range from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has 20 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 6 through 8 moist or dry.  It is very gravelly clay, or very gravelly silty clay, averaging 40 to 50 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metasedimentary, metavolcanic and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean January temperature is 40 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.
