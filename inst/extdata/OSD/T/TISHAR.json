  "OVERVIEW": "The Tishar series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metasedimentary, metavolcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Tishar soils are on footslopes and mountainsides in upland areas and have slopes of 3 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
