  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuffo series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff and tuffaceous sandstone.  Tuffo soils are on rock pediments, ash flows, and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
