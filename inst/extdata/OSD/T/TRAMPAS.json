  "OVERVIEW": "The Trampas series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from mixed sediments.  Trampas soils are on dissected old alluvial fans and plains and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
