  "OVERVIEW": "The Taylor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

It is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to Bt and E horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. In pedons having matrix chroma greater than 2 there are Fe depletions or subhorizons having chroma of 2 or less within the upper 10 inches. It is clay. It ranges from strongly acid to neutral, but the lower part may be slightly alkaline. Clay content ranges from 60 to 80 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay or silty clay. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay or silty clay, but in some pedons it has thin coarser textured varves. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nA sandy substratum phase is recognized where a 2C horizon is present below 60 inches. It has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, gravelly sand or gravelly coarse sand.

The slope gradient commonly is 0 to 8 percent, but ranges as high as 45 percent on sideslopes of drainageways. The soils formed in clayey calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits. The mean annual air temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 21 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 88 to 135 days. Elevation is about 1000 to 1600 feet above sea level."

The somewhat poorly Alango, poorly drained Indus and the very poorly drained Wildwood or Woodslake soils are in a hydrosequence with Taylor soils. Dalbo soils are on similar topographic positions as Taylor soils but are fine. The moderately well drained Baudette soils and the poorly drained Spooner soils are developed in lacustrine silts and are closely associated with Taylor soils in a few places."
