Consistence is slightly sticky and plastic throughout.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  The mean annual soil temperature is 75 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 5YR or 7.5YR, values and chromas of 3 or 4.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine and medium granular.\nThe Bt horizon has hues of 5YR or 2.5YR, values of 3 or 5, and chromas of 4 to 6.  Structure is moderate fine or medium subangular blocky. Clay films range from few faint to many distinct."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  The Caracoles, Islote, Juncal, Rio Lajas, San German, San Sebastian and Teja series are similar soils in related families.  The Caracoles, San German, and Teja soils lack B horizons.  The Islote soils are deeper to the calcareous sandstone.  The Juncal soils have thicker argillic horizons.  The Rio Lajas soils are sandy throughout.  The San Sebastian are calcareous and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their profiles."
