  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 3 percent, and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The soil is 60 to 100 percent base saturated and exchangeable sodium and potassium remain constant or decrease slightly with increasing depth.  The control section is usually light loam and has 7 to 18 percent clay, 25 to 55 percent silt and 30 to 60 percent sand, with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Usually this horizon has granular or crumb structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5 through 7.5YR."

Burnt Lake, Coski and Dinnen soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Clergern soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Sawcreek soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sula soils have a cambic horizon and formed in coarse textured loess over finer materials at a depth of 3 or more feet."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Teoculli soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans and valley-filling side slopes.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured, slightly to moderately acid sediments derived principally from gneiss and schist.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches, about half of which falls during the months of April through August.  The average annual temperature is 37 degrees F., and the average July temperature is 56 degrees F."
