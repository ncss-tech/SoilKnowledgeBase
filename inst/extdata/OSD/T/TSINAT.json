They formed in eolian material derived from Quaternary loess, volcanic ash, and pumice and alluvium derived from reworked loess and Tertiary basalt. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Tetilla soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches, do not have cemented pans, and occur on toeslopes of plateaus. Churipa soils are shallow to petrocalcic horizons, do not have calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders of plateaus."

(Ak horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 2 to about 14 inches. (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 14 to about 28 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nDuripan - The zone from 28 to about 46 inches. (Bkqm horizon)\nLithic contact - Indurated basalt bedrock at 54 inches. (2R layer)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 2 to 21 inches (Btk horizons)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 54 inches.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006..\nADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location has been sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S99NM-049-15.\nNote: This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the coarse silt or very fine sand fractions within 75 cm of the soil surface. It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony. In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low. Tsinat soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
