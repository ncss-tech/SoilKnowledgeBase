  "OVERVIEW": "The Trace series consists of very deep, well drained soils on low stream terraces.  These soils formed in about 2.5 to 5 feet of moderately permeable silty alluvium underlain by extremely gravelly alluvium with rapid to very rapid permeability.  Slopes range 0 to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.  Solum thickness and depth to rapidly or very rapidly permeable gravelly horizons ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Fragments of gravel range from 0 to 10 percent in the A and Bt horizons, about 15 to 60 percent in the 2BC horizon, and about 60 to 90 percent in the 2C horizon. The fragments are rounded and subrounded chert and range up to about 3 inches in diameter.  Each horizon is moderately acid or strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Where the value is 3, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  The texture is silt loam.\nThe BA horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles in shades of brown or yellow range from few to many.  The texture is silt loam and silty clay loam, except in the lower part, its range includes loam and clay loam.\nMany pedons have a 2BC horizon that has colors like the Bt or 2C horizon.  The fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The texture is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Mottles in shades of brown range from none to common."

Armour soils have 35 percent or less gravel in the C horizon and have moderate permeability.  Barnsdall, Dexter, Dossman, and Goodwill soils are free of rock fragments in the lower part of the subsoil.  Hicks soils have bedrock between 40 to 60 inches from the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trace soils are on low stream terraces.  Local relief above the nearest stream is commonly 10 to 30 feet.  Elevation is commonly 425 to 725 feet above mean sea level.  Slopes are linear and range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in silty alluvium of probable loess influence underlain by gravelly alluvium.  The rounded and subrounded pebbles are dominantly chert. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 53.3 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 58 degrees F."

Humphreys soils have between 15 and 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Pruitton soils are fine-loamy. Nolin soils do not have an argillic horizon in the subsoil and have few fragments above 40 inches.  Riverby soils are loamy-skeletal.  Paden soils have a fragipan in the subsoil.  Hawthorne and Biffle soils are moderately deep to hard limestone or a paralithic contact."
