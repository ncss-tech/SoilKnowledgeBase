Carlow, Chequest, Kings, and Streator soils contain more than 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section (B and C horizons). Cove soils are neutral to moderately acid and have more clay in the lower part of the series control section. Fults soils average more than 45 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section. Kalona soils have less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Lanyon soils have carbonates at a depth of 31 to 51 cm (12 to 20 inches) depth in the upper third of the series control section. Mackerlake soils have peraquic moisture regime  and have sodium adsorption ratio of greater than 13. Marna soils have more sand in the lower part of the series control section. Moline soils have carbonates within a depth of 127 cm (50 inches). Rosedell soils have carbonates ranging from 31 to 71 cm (12 to 28 inches), and the lower part of the series is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Waldorf soils average between 40 and 50 percent clay and less than 10 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. Woodbury soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 13.3 degrees C (56 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Titus soils are on flood plains of large streams. They occupy micro-highs, shallow depressions, and backswamps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in silty clay loam or silty clay slackwater sediments and may be stratified in the lower part. Climate is mid-continental with hot summers and cold winters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 13.9 degrees C (48 to 57 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1140 mm (30 to 45 inches), frost-free period ranges from 160 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 213 meters (340 to 700 feet) above mean sea level."

Ambraw soils are fine-loamy and are on similar or slightly higher parts of the flood plains nearby. Beaucoup soils are fine-silty and are on similar or slightly higher adjacent or nearby parts of the flood plains. Darwin soils have more clay in the control section and are on similar or slightly lower parts of the flood plains. The somewhat poorly drained Tice soils are fine-silty and are on higher parts of the flood plain."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow. Flooding typically occurs occasionally or frequently on Titus soils. Most areas protected by levees are rarely flooded."
