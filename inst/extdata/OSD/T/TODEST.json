  "OVERVIEW": "The Todest series consists of moderately deep to limestone, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian material, alluvium, and slope alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone. Todest soils are on dip slopes of cuestas. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
