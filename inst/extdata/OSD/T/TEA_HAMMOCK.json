In most areas, the natural vegetation has been removed and the existing vegetation consists of seagrass species under good to excellent water quality conditions or rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families under degraded or poor water quality conditions."
