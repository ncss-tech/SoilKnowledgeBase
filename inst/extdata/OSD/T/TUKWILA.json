  "OVERVIEW": "The Tukwila series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material stratified with diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash.  Tukwila soils are in depressions on stream terraces and glacial uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic material in which Tukwila soils formed ranges in thickness from 51 inches to more than 10 feet and is underlain with mineral layers ranging in texture  from loamy sand to silty clay.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are mostly derived from sedges and have 0 to 15 percent decomposing woody fragments.  Layers of diatomite, with combined thickness of 2 to 10 inches, occur at depths from 8 to 24 inches.  Thin layers of mucky peat, peat, sand, or sandy loam are in the control section of some pedons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 1 to 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry, and chroma of 0 to 6 moist and dry.  This layer has moderate to weak granular blocky,platy, or prismatic structure.  It is 5 to 25 percent fiber, less than 10 percent rubbed.  They are very strongly acid to strongly acid (pH 4.5 to 5.5 in water)."

In addition, Seattle soils lack diatomaceous earth strata and have more than 10 inches at hemic material above 36 inches.  Shalcar soils have a loamy substratum within 50 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are in depressions on stream terraces and glacial uplands at elevations of 25 to 750 feet.  They formed in organic materials with a few mineral layers.  Areas are saturated and often ponded in winter and early spring.  Tukwila soils occur in a mild climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 80 inches; the average January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 64 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 150 to 200 days."
