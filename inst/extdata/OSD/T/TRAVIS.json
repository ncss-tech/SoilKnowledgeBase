    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The boundary between the E and Bt horizon is abrupt or clear and there is more than 20 percent absolute clay increase between the E and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the A and E horizons are loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragments in the form of siliceous pebbles range from 0 to 35 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon, where present, has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe Bt1 horizon is sandy clay, clay, or gravelly clay.  Texture of the Bt2 horizon is sandy clay, or gravelly sandy clay. The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages about 45 percent clay with a range of 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction of the Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe BC horizon ranges from reddish brown to yellowish red or light red in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray ranges from none to common.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  Siliceous pebbles in the BC horizons range from a few to 75 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

The regolith consists of reddish clayey and loamy sediments assumed to be ancient terraces.  The climate is dry to moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 69 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 240 to 270 days and elevation ranges from 300 to 1200 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 40 to 64."
