  "OVERVIEW": "The Tamarindo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Tamarindo soils are on footslopes of interfluves of undulating plains. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
