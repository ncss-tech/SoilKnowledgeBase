Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."

Arojomil soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Clovis soils have a calcic horizon and occur on backslopes and footslopes. Kinsell soils are fine-silty, have a mollic epipedon, and are on floodplains and channels of valley floors. Raydawn soils are loamy-skeletal, have a calcic horizon, and occur on shoulders and backslopes."
