  "OVERVIEW": "The Tankridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from mudstone. Tankridge soils are moderately deep to paralithic bedrock materials with cracks closer than 10 centimeters apart. Tankridge soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2160 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
