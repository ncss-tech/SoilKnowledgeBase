  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Talmage soils are over 60 inches deep.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soil between a depth of 8 to 80 inches is dry, in all parts, from July through September and is moist in all parts from January to May.\nCoarse fragments average 35 to 90 percent in the 10 inch to 40 inch particle-size control section.  The fine fraction of the particle-size control section averages loamy very fine sand or finer.  Textures are stratified throughout the profile and organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.  It is moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/2, or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, or 7.5YR 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4, or 7.5YR 4/4.  The upper C horizon is stratified gravelly loam through extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It may have thin strata of gravelly loam.  The lower C horizon is very gravelly loamy sand through very gravelly coarse sand."
