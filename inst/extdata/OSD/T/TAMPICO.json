  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tampico series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in noncalcareous granitic sediments. These soils are on mountain slopes, toeslopes, valleys and fans. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Auzqui, Bynum, Redcloud, Thayne, Tilton and Wrenman soils are calcareous within 40 inch depths. Auzqui and Tilton soils also lack cambic horizons. Emerald soils do not have cambic horizons and the rock fragments are dominantly stones. Tamp soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 45 degrees F. Mean annual summer soil temperature is less than 56 degrees F., without 0 horizons. Teton and Wrenman soils have bedrock at less than 40 inch depths. Uhl soils do not have cambic horizons and less than 5 percent rock fragments."

Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  These soils formed mainly in noncalcareous sediments washed from granite and sandstone of nearby uplands. The climate is cool temperate continental with average annual air temperature ranging from 37 to 45 degrees F., and a mean annual July temperature of about 65 degrees F.  The annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches. The frost-free period is less than 90 days."
