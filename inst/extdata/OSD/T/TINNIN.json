  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of about 14 and 43 inches is usually dry in all parts from June to November unless irrigated, and moist in all parts from January to May.  Distinct and prominent mottles usually are present at depths of 22 to 48 inches.  The soil has 1 to 10 percent fine (2-5 mm) rounded gravel.  Clay content is 0 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, or 4/3 and 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3 moist.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  This horizon has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4, and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/3 or 3/4.  It commonly is loamy coarse sand or loamy sand, but includes sand in the lower part of some pedons.  The upper C horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline, and the lower C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in predominantly granitic alluvium.  Elevations are 5 to 110 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs in winter months.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 to 61 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 260 to 280 days."
