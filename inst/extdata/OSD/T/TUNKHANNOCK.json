  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunkhannock series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in water-sorted glacial material derived from reddish sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the substratum. Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches. Mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is 3 1/2 to 10 feet or more. Rock fragments, dominantly water rounded sandstone or siltstone range from 15 to 60 percent, by volume, in individual horizons of the B horizon and from 40 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragments average more than 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section. The soil ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid throughout, where unlimed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry color value is 6 or more. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nUndisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon that has a hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and a chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon. They have a hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6, with chroma of 5 or 6 only in the upper part. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The content of sand coarser than very fine sand averages less than 50 percent in the solum. Some pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR. Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have stratified silt and clay below a depth of 40 inches."

The Chamate soils are formed in colluvium derived from welded tuff that have flaked off the rock outcrops above these soils. Chenango soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout the B horizon. Oquaga soils are moderately deep."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F., and the frost free period ranges from 130 to 180 days.
