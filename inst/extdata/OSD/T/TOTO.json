  "OVERVIEW": "The Toto series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in herbaceous organic material over coprogenous material (sedimentary peat), marly material, and sand deposits on outwash plains, lake plains terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees).",
