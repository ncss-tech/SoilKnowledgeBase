    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toto soils are on broad low-lying areas and in depressional areas on outwash plains, lake plains, terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Toto soils formed in herbaceous organic material over coprogenous material (sedimentary peat), marly material, and sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

The very poorly drained Adrian, Edwards, and Houghton soils are on similar landform positions and lack coprogenous material. Houghton soils also have more than 30 cm (51 inches) of organic material. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Maumee soils are on slightly higher areas, and the entire series control section consists of mineral materials. The somewhat poorly drained Morocco and Watseka soils are on higher ridges and knolls, and the entire series control section consists of mineral materials."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the herbaceous muck, moderately low in the coprogenous material and marly material, and high or very high in the underlying sand. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the herbaceous muck, slow in the coprogenous material and marly material, and rapid in the underlying sand."
