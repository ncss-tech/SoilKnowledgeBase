These soils formed in eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash and pumice.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,345 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
