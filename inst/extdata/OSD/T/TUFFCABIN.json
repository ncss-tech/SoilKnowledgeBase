  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuffcabin series consists of deep to a buried duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash and pumice.  Tuffcabin soils are on beach ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
