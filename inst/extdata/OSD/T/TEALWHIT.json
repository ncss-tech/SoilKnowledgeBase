The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 140 inches.  The average January temperature is about 38 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 59 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 200 days."

All of these soils except Kydaka and Sekiu soils lack an aquic moisture regime.  Also, Aabab have less than 35 percent clay in the control section; Calawah and Queets soils are medial; Klone and Snahopish soils are medial, skeletal; and Ozette soils are medial and have a densic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Kydaka soils are medial and moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Sekiu soils are very fine and kaolinitic."
