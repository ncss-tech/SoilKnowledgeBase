Goldrun soils have fine sand particle-size control sections that are calcareous in the lower part and are slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline. Grandora and Hotsprings soils have particle-size control sections with more than 5 percent gravel. Incy soils average loamy sand of granitic eolian origin. Lachim, Painter, Quinton, Rinquin, and Walco soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Quincy and Winchester soils have particle-size control sections dominated by dark basaltic mineral grains."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toll soils are on alluvial fans, dunes, fan piedmonts, and terraces at elevations of 1,220 to 1,680 meters. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from mixed rocks. Climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C. The frost-free season is about 80 to 120 days."
