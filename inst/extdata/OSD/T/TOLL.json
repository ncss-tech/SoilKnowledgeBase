  "OVERVIEW": "The Toll series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and alluvium from mixed rocks. The Toll soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Goldrun soils have fine sand particle-size control sections that are calcareous in the lower part and are slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline. Grandora and Hotsprings soils have particle-size control sections with more than 5 percent gravel. Incy soils average loamy sand of granitic eolian origin. Lachim, Painter, Quinton, Rinquin, and Walco soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Quincy and Winchester soils have particle-size control sections dominated by dark basaltic mineral grains."
