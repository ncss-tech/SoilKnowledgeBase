The upper part of the control section has more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. When mixed, the control section averages more than 35 percent gravel and cobbles, and the matrix is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Surface stones or boulders are 0 to 3 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam or sandy loam. This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. It is very gravelly sand or loamy sand. This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

Antrobus soils formed in basaltic material and have more than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Grafen, Middlehill, Ramack, Supervisor, Surdal and Parachute soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Enochlake soils do not have a Bw horizon. Greyback, Farlow and Silvercliff soils have continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate. Broad Canyon, Handran, Kamack, Klug, Maurice, Midelight, Midfork, Sebud, Sawpit, Thornburgh and Tiban soils lack 2C horizons within 40 inches."
