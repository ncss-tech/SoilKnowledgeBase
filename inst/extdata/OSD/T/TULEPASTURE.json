  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series would qualify for a strongly contrasting family of clayey over ashy if such a class existed in Soil Taxonomy.  The mineralogy class of the upper part of the control section would be diatomaceous if the class was allowed in Mollisols, otherwise the class would be mixed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nHistic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (Oi and Oa horizons).\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 8 to 24 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 72 inches at certain times during normal years.\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (A2 horizon and parts of the A1 and 2C horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S97OR-037-004 (pedon # 98P0142).  The pedon has two horizons sampled at depths of 20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14 inches) and 36 to 60 centimeters (14 to 24 inches).  Volcanic glass content was also determined locally on three horizons of the typical pedon by optical grain counts using a polarizing petrographic microscope.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
