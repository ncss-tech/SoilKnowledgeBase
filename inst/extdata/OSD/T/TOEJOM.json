  "OVERVIEW": "The Toejom series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Toejom soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
