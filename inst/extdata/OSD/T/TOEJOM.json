Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,750 to 2,450 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

The native vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon with an understory of antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush, curl-leaf mountain mahogany, bluegrass, desert needlegrass, and scattered Jeffrey pine. This pedon is correlated to R026XY104NV, PIMO woodland."
