  "OVERVIEW": "The Terbies series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.  These soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 30 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
