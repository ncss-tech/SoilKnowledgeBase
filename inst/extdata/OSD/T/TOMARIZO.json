  "OVERVIEW": "The Tomarizo series consists of shallow and very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from dacitic breccia.  Tomarizo soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
