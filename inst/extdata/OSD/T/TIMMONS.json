  "OVERVIEW": "The Timmons series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Timmons soils are on nearly level to gently sloping, dissected marine terraces and have slopes 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

Elevations are 0 to 183 meters (0 to 600 feet). These soils form in marine deposits derived from mixed sources. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2285 millimeters (35 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 275 to 325 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 48 centimeters (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 48 to 152 centimeters (AB, Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 48 to 98 centimeters, averages 28 percent clay and 30 percent fine sand and coarser, by weight.(AB and Bt1 horizons)\nEdit Log: Timmons was originally proposed in 1965 with well and moderately well drained Map Units.  In 2009 Timmons was revisited and decision made to separate well and moderately well drained soils, as well as soils under forest canopy and isomesic from cleared or developed areas that are mesic. This resulted in four separate soil series. The typical pedon was changed in January of 2010 to reflect the well drained series concept on permanent pasture.\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNASIS User Pedon ID 07CA605382"
