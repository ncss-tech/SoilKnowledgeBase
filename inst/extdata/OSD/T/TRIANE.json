  "OVERVIEW": "The Triane series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in eolian material over local slope alluvium derived from shale.  They formed on playa rims with slopes of 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
