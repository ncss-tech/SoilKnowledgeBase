  "OVERVIEW": "The Top series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt with an influence of loess in the upper part.  Top soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The Cleymore soils are slightly acid or moderately acid throughout and have slickensides.  The LaPlatta and Mondey soils have secondary carbonates in the lower part of their profiles and lack vitrandic features.  Shar soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock.  Streek soils are moderately well drained and have slickensides.  Wickiser soils have secondary carbonates at a depth of 30 to 44 inches and are slightly or moderately alkaline throughout."
