The base saturation is less than 75 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches of the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 in the upper part and is 2 or 3 in the lower part of the horizon.  It has 15 to 30 percent glass and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.2 to 0.5 percent.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry to depth of 20 inches or more and may range to 4 moist and 6 dry below a depth of 20 inches.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cleymor, Laplatta, Mondey, Shar, Streek and Wickiser series.  All of these soils lack an O horizon except for the Cleymor soil.  The Cleymore soils are slightly acid or moderately acid throughout and have slickensides.  The LaPlatta and Mondey soils have secondary carbonates in the lower part of their profiles and lack vitrandic features.  Shar soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock.  Streek soils are moderately well drained and have slickensides.  Wickiser soils have secondary carbonates at a depth of 30 to 44 inches and are slightly or moderately alkaline throughout."

The soil formed in colluvium derived from basalt with an influence of loess in the upper part.  The climate is subhumid and has mean annual precipitation of 17 to 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F; and mean January temperature is about 29 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

Most areas with slopes of less than 15 percent have been cleared and are used for production for dryland grain and hay.  Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, pinegrass and elksedge.  This series is in what is called the Douglas-fir forest plant community."
