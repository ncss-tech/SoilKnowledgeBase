  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.  A few flakes of mica are in some pedons.\nTextures finer than loamy fine sand commonly are below the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section; but, if they are within the control section, their weighted average does not influence the sandy particle size class.  These horizons are buried surface layers, and are also noted by the irregular decrease of organic matter in the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam, or their coarse analogs.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 7.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or their coarse analogs.\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 or 1.  Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or rarely silty clay loam or their mucky analogs; or it is stratified with these and sandy textures.\nThe C or C'g horizon, below 40 inches where present, has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam, or their fine and coarse analogs, and is often stratified with other textures."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Duckston and Osier series in the same family, and the Bibb, Elloree, Johnston, Kinston, Muckalee, and Rutlege series in similar families.  Duckston soils have less than 5 percent silt plus clay in the control section.  Osier soils are dominantly sandy through a depth of 80 inches, and do not have thick strata of loamy material.  Bibb and Muckalee soils are coarse-loamy.  In addition, Muckalee soils are non-acid.  Elloree soils are Alfisols.  Kinston soils are fine-loamy.  Johnston and Rutlege soils have a thickened umbric epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Totness soils are on flood plains of streams in the Coastal Plain and Sand Hills.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  The soil formed in sandy and loamy fluvial sediments.  The stream channels are usually shallow and meandering.  The soils flood frequently and are subject to scouring and uneven deposition of overwash.  The climate is warm and humid with average annual temperature ranging from 62 to 66 degrees F., average annual precipitation ranging from 46 to 48 inches , and frost free season ranging from 220 to 240 days."

In addition, all except Alpin contain an argillic horizon.  Alpin soils contain lamellae."
