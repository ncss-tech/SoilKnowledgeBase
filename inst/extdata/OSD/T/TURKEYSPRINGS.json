  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Turkeysprings series consists of deep, well-drained upland soils on benches and on long, gentle dip slopes. They soils formed in material derived from limestone of the San Andres formation and modified in places by highly calcareous clayey shale of the Chinle formation. These soils occur at elevations of 7,200 to 7,800 feet, where the average annual precipitation is 19 to 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Turkeysprings soils are associated with the Kiln and Fortwingate soils.  They are deeper and less stony than the Kiln soils.  They are calcareous throughout the profile and lack an A2 horizon, which is present in the noncalcareous Fortwingate soils."
