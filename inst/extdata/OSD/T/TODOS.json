  "OVERVIEW": "The Todos series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from reddish sandstone and shale.  Todos soils are on foothills and uplands and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 62 degrees F.  and the soil temperature is never below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil becomes moist between depths of 4 and 12 inches in mid-November and remains moist until about mid-May.  It is usually dry the rest of the year.  Rock fragments make up about 5 percent of the soil volume except in horizons transitional to the parlithic contact where there is up to 20 percent gravel.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent in all parts of the soil profile.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter to a depth of 10 inches and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent at depths of 15 to 18 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark reddish brown or reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3) or dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2).  It is clay loam or light clay.  This horizon has weak to moderate granular or subangular blocky structure and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2t horizon is dusky red, reddish brown, dark reddish brown, or yellowish red (2.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4 or 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6).  It is clay with 35 to 48 percent clay, 6 to 10 percent (absolute) more clay than the A horizon.  This horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and the lower part is calcareous in most areas.\nThe Cr horizon is sandstone or shale and is shattered and decomposed to depth of several feet.  The parent material is reddish colored and imparts reddish colors to soils formed from it."
