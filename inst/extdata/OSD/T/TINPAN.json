  "OVERVIEW": "Tinpan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff.  Tinpan soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
