  "OVERVIEW": "The Thirtynine series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan remnants, terraces, hill footslopes, and toeslopes. The soils formed in alluvium derived primarily from siltstone and fine grained sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation is 975 to 1,730 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees.",
