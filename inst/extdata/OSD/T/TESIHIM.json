The Cannyon, Epping, Redarrow, Shingle, Taluce, and Tassel soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.  In addition Redarrow has less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand, Shingle soils average 20 percent or more clay, and Taluse and Tassek soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 52 degrees F.  Eslendo, Gerst, Picante, Remorris, Sandoval, and Simel soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  In addition, Gerst soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 degrees F. or less and Remorris and Simel soils have hues of 5YR or redder.  Quarteles soils have 10 to 20 percent volcantic glass and 5 to 10 percent mica component in the particle size control section."
