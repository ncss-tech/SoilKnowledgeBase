Headwaters soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Rabbitex soils are deep to a lithic contact. Rothican and Rothiemay soils receive most of their precipitation from March to June which is the driest period for Tylercreek soils. Zinzer soils have a MAP of 7 inches (178 mm) with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer."

Tylercreek sloils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches (381 to 432 mm).  April, May and June are the driest months, with monsoonal pattern rainfall in August, September, and October.  Light to moderate rainfall and snowfall occur during the winter months.  Mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F (5 to 7.2 degrees C).  The average frost-free period is 100 to 119 days."
