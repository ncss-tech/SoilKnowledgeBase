  "OVERVIEW": "The Tylercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Tylercreek soils are on hillslopes and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F (7.2 degrees C).",

Headwaters soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Rabbitex soils are deep to a lithic contact. Rothican and Rothiemay soils receive most of their precipitation from March to June which is the driest period for Tylercreek soils. Zinzer soils have a MAP of 7 inches (178 mm) with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer."
