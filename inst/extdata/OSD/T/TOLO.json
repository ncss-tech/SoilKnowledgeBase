    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Tolo soils have a moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.85 g/cubic centimeter, contain 60 to 70 percent glass in the ashy overlay, and have an estimated 5 to 15 percent clay . The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 75 consecutive days during the summer. Thickness of ashy materials and depth to contrasting materials range from 20 to 36 inches. Bedrock commonly is deeper than 60 inches to basalt bedrock but ranges to 40 inches in some areas. The soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nA 2Bwb horizon is present in some pedons, with color similar to the 2Btb horizon.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. The upper part is silt loam, silty clay loam, or cobbly silty clay loam, averages 18 to 35 percent clay, and has 0 to 35 percent rock fragments; the lower part below 40 inches may range from sandy loam to silty clay loam and contains up to 50 percent subangular basalt cobbles and gravel."

The Brusher and Smiling series have a similar classification with glassy mineralogy.\nDohert soils - 20 to 40 inches deep to fractured lithic bedrock (argillite or metasedimentary); the ashy part of the pscs has 2 to 5 percent clay; the loamy part of the pscs has 5 to 20 percent subangular rock fragments of argillite or metasedimentary origin.\nTorchsprings soils - the ashy part of the pscs has 5 to 8 percent clay; the loamy part of the pscs has 5 to 30 percent rounded and subrounded rock fragments of mixed glacial till origin.\nBrusher soils - ashy part of pscs ranges to Ashy-L and Ashy-FSL with 30 to 60 percent glass and glassy mineralogy; loamy part of pscs has 0 to 25 percent subangular rock fragments of granitic or porphyritic origin; has 2E/B and 2B/E horizons below ash mantle.\nSmiling soils - ashy part of pscs is Ashy-SL and glassy mineralogy; loamy part of pscs has 5 to 35 percent subangular rock fragments of basalt or andesite origin."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tolo soils are on nearly level upland plateaus and steep north and east-facing mountain side slopes at elevations of 2,800 to 5,400 feet. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. They formed in silty volcanic ash over older loamy mixed loess and colluvial materials of basalt origin. The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F, the mean January temperature is 27 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 61 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 45 inches with about 80 percent falling between October and June. The frost-free period ranges from 30 to 110 days."

Olot soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and have a skeletal subsoil. Klicker and Snell soils have an argillic horizon and more than 35 percent rock fragments."

More investigation in the vegetation correlated to this series is needed.]\nThis series concept represents an example of the best undisturbed ash mantle in xeric moisture regime in Blue Mountains.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data on 2 profiles (S60-Oreg-31-1 and 60-Oreg-31-2) reported in Lincoln Soil Survey Laboratory Report for soils sampled in Union County, Oregon, 1960.
