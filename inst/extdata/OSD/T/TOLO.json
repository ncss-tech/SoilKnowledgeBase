The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 75 consecutive days during the summer. Thickness of ashy materials and depth to contrasting materials range from 20 to 36 inches. Bedrock commonly is deeper than 60 inches to basalt bedrock but ranges to 40 inches in some areas. The soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nA 2Bwb horizon is present in some pedons, with color similar to the 2Btb horizon.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. The upper part is silt loam, silty clay loam, or cobbly silty clay loam, averages 18 to 35 percent clay, and has 0 to 35 percent rock fragments; the lower part below 40 inches may range from sandy loam to silty clay loam and contains up to 50 percent subangular basalt cobbles and gravel."
