  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Twinpalms series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments dredged from submerged areas.  These very gently sloping soils are on low mounds on spoil pile areas.  These soils are subject to occasional flooding by high storm surge from strong tropical storms.  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).",
