  "OVERVIEW": "The Tobin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium.  Tobin soils are on flood plains on river valleys in MLRA 73, Rolling Plains and Breaks.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters (29 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
