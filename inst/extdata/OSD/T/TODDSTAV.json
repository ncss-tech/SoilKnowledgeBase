  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Angular and subrounded quartz pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum.  Fine and very fine mica flakes are common to many in the solum.  It is extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2 with masses of iron accumualtions of higher chroma.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Fine sandy loam is restricted to the lower part of the Btg horizon.\nThe 2C horizon color is variable and commonly contains shades of gray and yellow.  In some pedons, the 2C horizon lacks a dominant color.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam."
