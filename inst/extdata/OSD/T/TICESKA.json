(1 to 15 inches thick)\n2R--39 inches; fractured basalt with lime and silica coating on top and in the fractures of the basalt."

Doel, Oupico, Prinville, Shalake, Skull Creek, Tauncal, and Taunton soils all lack bedrock within 40 inches.  Jestrick soils are somewhat excessively drained and have moderate rapid permeability and are noncalcareous above 7 to 15 inches.  Tauncal soils also lack a calcic horizon."

The Ticeska soils formed in alluvium with eolian influence.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 11 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 120 days."
