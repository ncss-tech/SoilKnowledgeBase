  "OVERVIEW": "The Ticeska Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium with eolian influence.  Ticeska soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
