  "OVERVIEW": "The Tordia series consists of soils that are deep to weathered mudstone and\nSandstone from sediments like the Jackson Group. They are well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey material over materials weathered from mudstone and sandstone containing volcanic ash and shards. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on side slopes, shoulders and summits of broad interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",
