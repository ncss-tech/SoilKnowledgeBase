Angular and semi-rounded rock fragments of granite, hornblende gneiss, amphibolite or diorite range from 25 to 85 percent in the A and E horizons and more than 35 percent in the B and C horizons. Content of mica flakes ranges from none to common in the A and B horizons and none to many in the C horizon.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, chroma of 1 through 3.  A surface layer that is 7 inches or more thick with a value moist of 3 or less and a value dry of 5 or less is required.  Fine-earth texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 through 6.  Fine-earth texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 4 through 8.  Fine-earth texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 3 through 8.  Fine-earth texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 6 through 8.

Widgett soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Hartleton, Irondale, Macove, Pattenburg and Trevlac are in the related Typic family.  These soils do not have the humic feature in the surface layer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Thunder soils formed in colluvium weathered from granite, hornblende gneiss, amphibolite or diorite rock.  They are in coves and on toe slopes on concave or linear uplands in the Blue Ridge province.  Slopes range from 2 to 95 percent.  The climate is temperate and humid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 60 inches."

Edneytown, Edneyville and Evard soils are on higher sideslope positions and are non-skeletal. Saunook, Thurmont and Tusquitee soils are on similar positions and non-skeletal.  Parker and Porters soils are on higher residual sideslope positions and do not have argillic horizons.  Clifton and Hayesville soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on residual summit, shoulder and sideslope positions.  Buladean, Chestnut, Cowee and Pigeonroost soils are on residual summit, shoulder and sideslope positions.  Buladean soils are deep and Chestnut, Cowee and Pigeonroost soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Additionally, Buladean and Chestnut soils do not have argillic horizons."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Series was proposed in the Jefferson National Forest, Rockbridge County, Virginia, 1987.\nThe 7/98 revision places Thunder soils in an active CEC activity class.  Class placement is based on similar soils in the region such as Toecane, Ednyville and Edneytown.\nThe 9/2008 revision adjusts the thickness of the A horizon, adds the humic conditions to the A horizon range and expands the reaction range to include very strongly acid.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\n1)  Humic feature - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\n2)  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (A1, A2, and E horizons).\n3)  Argillic horizon - the zone from 13 to 43 inches (Bt horizons).\n4)  Loamy-skeletal feature - average rock fragment content of 35 percent or more in the particle-size control section (13 to 33 inch depth).\nSIR = VA0283\nMLRA = 130\nRevised: 12/17/92-MHC; 1/93-TWB; 9/96-BPS,DHK; 7/98-DHK; 9/08-DGF\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
