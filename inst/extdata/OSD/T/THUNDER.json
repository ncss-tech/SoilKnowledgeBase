  "OVERVIEW": "The Thunder series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils on colluvial toe slopes, in drainageways and in coves.  They formed in rocky colluvium from granite, hornblende gneiss, amphibolite or dioritein the central and southern Blue Ridge.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 49 inches.",

Edneytown, Edneyville and Evard soils are on higher sideslope positions and are non-skeletal. Saunook, Thurmont and Tusquitee soils are on similar positions and non-skeletal.  Parker and Porters soils are on higher residual sideslope positions and do not have argillic horizons.  Clifton and Hayesville soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on residual summit, shoulder and sideslope positions.  Buladean, Chestnut, Cowee and Pigeonroost soils are on residual summit, shoulder and sideslope positions.  Buladean soils are deep and Chestnut, Cowee and Pigeonroost soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Additionally, Buladean and Chestnut soils do not have argillic horizons."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Series was proposed in the Jefferson National Forest, Rockbridge County, Virginia, 1987.\nThe 7/98 revision places Thunder soils in an active CEC activity class.  Class placement is based on similar soils in the region such as Toecane, Ednyville and Edneytown.\nThe 9/2008 revision adjusts the thickness of the A horizon, adds the humic conditions to the A horizon range and expands the reaction range to include very strongly acid.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\n1)  Humic feature - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\n2)  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 14 inches (A1, A2, and E horizons).\n3)  Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 44 inches (Bt horizons).\n4)  Loamy-skeletal feature - average rock fragment content of 35 percent or more in the particle-size control section (14 to 34 inch depth).\nSIR = VA0283\nMLRA = 130\nRevised: 12/17/92-MHC; 1/93-TWB; 9/96-BPS,DHK; 7/98-DHK; 9/08-DGF; 1/2022-WJN\n1/2022 revision: Oi had 1 to 0 inch depths, corrected to be 0 to 1 in horizon depths then added 1 inch to all horizon depths throughout the typical pedon."
