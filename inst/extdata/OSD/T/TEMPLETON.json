  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. The soil is 40 to more than 60 inches deep to weathered siltstone and sandstone. The particle-size control section has an average of 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Measured clay commonly is higher than field estimated clay. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The upper 5 to 8 inches of the epipedon has an acid-oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, and 15-bar moisture of more than 15 percent. The lower part to a depth of 20 inches has an acid-oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.0 g/cc. Andic soil properties do not exceed beyond 14 inches. The soil has 20 to 30 kilograms of organic carbon per square meter to a depth of 1 meter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter and 0 to 15 percent subangular shaped paragravel. It is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR moist and dry, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam and has 0 to 50 percent subangular shaped pararock fragments. It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR typically with segments of 5YR hue in some pedons from less decomposed parent material. It has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 8."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ecola, Knappa, and Walluski series. Ecola soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Knappa soils have an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick, and when present, have rounded or subrounded rock or pararock fragments of alluvial origin.  Walluski soils have redox depletions within a depth of 24 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Templeton soils are benches, broad ridgetops, and side slopes of mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 50 to 1,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The marine climate is cool and wet in the winter and cool and moist with a short dry season of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 110 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 245 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon - from 1 to 17 inches.\nCambic horizon - from 17 to 43 inches.\nAndic feature - from 1 to 17 inches with the zone from 1 to 7 inches having andic soil properties.\nParticle-size control section - from 11 to 41 inches.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nA proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties. If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data on the typical pedon (S72Oreg-6-2-(1-6) completed at SCS lab at Riverside, California.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
