  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments consist of pebbles, cobbles, and stones and average 35 to 85 percent of the soil. The soil is usually moist between 14 inches and bedrock but is dry in all parts from early August to early October. The base saturation is about 70 to 90 percent immediately above a lithic contact. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, or 5YR 4/6 and moist color of 10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/6, 3/4; 5YR 3/3, 4/4, or 3/4. It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay, modified by 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. It is neutral or mildly alkaline. Only the upper 1 to 3 inches have the dark colors of a mollic epipedon.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 10YR 6/6; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, 4/4; 5YR 5/6 or 5YR 4/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/4; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/4, 6/6; 5YR 3/4, 4/4 or 5/6. It is heavy clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay modified by 60 to 85 percent rock fragments. It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Rock outcrop ranges from 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The climate is Canadian with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 44 degrees F. Mean January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 63 degrees F. The average frost-free season is 80 to 150 days."
