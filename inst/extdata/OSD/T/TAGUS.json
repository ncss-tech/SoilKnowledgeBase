Elevations are 230 to 400 feet. The climate is semiarid and has hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 62 degrees to 65 degrees F. The frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."

Mollic epipedon -- The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 17 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).\n2. Calcic horizon -- The zone from a depth of 17 to 40 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\n3. Lab analysis for this typical pedon-sample numbers 88P5294S, 95S and 96S.\n4. Regular decrease of organic carbon with increasing depth (see lab data).\nChanged classification from typic to calcic and removed carbonates from surface due to additional information.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
