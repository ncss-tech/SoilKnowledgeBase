  "OVERVIEW": "The Teeltruc series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and alluvium derived from tuff and basalt and in volcanic ash derived from dacite.  Teeltruc soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
