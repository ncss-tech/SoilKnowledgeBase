    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teeltruc soils are on plateaus.  The typically occur on toeslope positions.  These soils formed in eolian deposits and alluvium derived from tuff and basalt and in volcanic ash derived from dacite.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and mean July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
