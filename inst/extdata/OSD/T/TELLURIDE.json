  "OVERVIEW": "The Telluride series consist of shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum and till derived from andesite, rhyolite, breccia, basalt, or tuff.  These soils are on basin floors, ridges, mountain slopes, hillslopes, and mesa summits.  Slopes range from 5 to 120 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1,041 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about -1.7 degrees C.",
