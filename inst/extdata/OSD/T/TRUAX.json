Bissell soils are micaceous throughout and have less than 5 percent rock fragments.  Bjork, Indiano, Pahrange and Simcoe have a lithic contact at depths less than 40 inches.  Cowiche soils are mildly or moderately alkaline throughout and have an A horizon and the upper part of the B2t horizon that formed in loess 18 to 40 inches thick over uncomformable residual material.  Dodes, Fredrickson and Uhaldi soils have a paralithic contact at depths less than 40 inches.  Margerum soils have 20 to 40 percent pumice in the particle size control section and 15 to 35 percent pumice coarse fragments and have a solum 40 to 52 inches thick.  Orr soils lack silica cementation in the C horizon, have angular blocky and prismatic structure or are massive in the Bt, are usually gravelly in the C horizon and usually have a thicker solum. Ralls soils have a mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline solum and are influenced by loess.  Springmeyer soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 25 to 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."
