    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees F to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is about 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 9 to 21 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 until November 10 (145 days).  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 32 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent of the soil, by volume.  Stones range from 0 to 2 percent.  Cobbles range from 0 to 8 percent.  Gravel range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mollic epipedon is 14 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 15 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 7.5YR 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is sandy clay loam or loam and averages 20 to 26 percent clay with at least 4 percent more clay content than the A horizon.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt2 horizon has dry color 10YR 5/4, 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/2 and moist color of 7.5YR 4/4 or 3/4.  It is sandy clay loam or loam and averages 20 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Cq horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4, 7/5YR 5/4, 6/2 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 5/4.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Clay content is 10 to 15 percent."

Bissell soils are micaceous throughout and have less than 5 percent rock fragments.  Bjork, Indiano, Pahrange and Simcoe have a lithic contact at depths less than 40 inches.  Cowiche soils are mildly or moderately alkaline throughout and have an A horizon and the upper part of the B2t horizon that formed in loess 18 to 40 inches thick over uncomformable residual material.  Dodes, Fredrickson and Uhaldi soils have a paralithic contact at depths less than 40 inches.  Margerum soils have 20 to 40 percent pumice in the particle size control section and 15 to 35 percent pumice coarse fragments and have a solum 40 to 52 inches thick.  Orr soils lack silica cementation in the C horizon, have angular blocky and prismatic structure or are massive in the Bt, are usually gravelly in the C horizon and usually have a thicker solum. Ralls soils have a mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline solum and are influenced by loess.  Springmeyer soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 25 to 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."
