  "OVERVIEW": "The Tiff series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed clayey residuum on uplands.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep areas that have been truncated by mining operations.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches.",
