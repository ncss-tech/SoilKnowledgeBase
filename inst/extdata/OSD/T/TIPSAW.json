  "OVERVIEW": "The Tipsaw series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on scarps and hills. They formed in loamy residuum from sandstone interbedded with shale and siltstone. Slopes range from 20 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
