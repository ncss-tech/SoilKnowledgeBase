  "OVERVIEW": "The Tert series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tertiary lacustrine sedimentary rocks.  The Tert soils are on hills and pediment remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
