  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Teczuni soils formed in eolian material and alluvium, slope alluvium, and fan alluvium derived from sandstone and shale and are on toeslopes of hills and ridges and fan remnants on valley sides, and dipslopes of cuestas. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 6,800 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches. The frost free period is 115 to 135 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Silcat soils on valley floors and sides; the Flugle soils on fan terraces; and the Toldohn and Vessilla soils on escarpments. The Silcat soils lack an argillic horizon and have vertic properties. The Flugle soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and lack a calcic horizon. The Toldohn and Vessilla soils are very shallow and shallow to shale and sandstone."
