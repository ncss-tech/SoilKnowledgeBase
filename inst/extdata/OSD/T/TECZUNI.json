  "OVERVIEW": "The Teczuni series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium, slope alluvium, and fan alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Teczuni soils are on dipslopes of cuestas, ridges, toeslopes of hills and fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
