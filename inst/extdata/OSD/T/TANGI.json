  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 38 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid throughout the solum, except in areas that have been limed.  The effective cation exchange capacity of the solum below the surface layer is 20 to 50 percent or more saturated with exchangeable aluminum.  Content of total sand in the family textural control section ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Less than 15 percent of the sand in the family particle-size control section is fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where value is 3, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a thin silt loam BE horizon.  This horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Mottles in shades of brown range from few to common.  The lower part of the Bt horizon is clay loam in some pedons.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Hues of 7.5YR or 10YR are mostly in the uppermost subhorizon of the 2Btx horizon.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, or red range from few to many.  Texture is loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Content of total sand in the 2Btx horizon ranges from 25 to 60 percent.  Content of clay in the 2Btx horizon ranges from 20 to 55 percent.  As least one subhorizon of the 2Btx horizon contains more than 35 percent clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lax, Leadvale, Shatta and Toula series in the same family and the Cane, Loring, Ora, Providence, and Savannah series.  Lax soils have 2Btx horizons with 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments of chert of quartzite.  Leadville soils have shale fragments in the lower Bt horizon.  Shatta soils contain 25 percent or more total sand in the control section and do not have a 2Btx horizon.  Tangi soils do not have a Btx horizon with more than 35 percent clay.  Cane, Ora, and Savannah soils are fine-loamy.  Loring and Providence soils have mixed mineralogy and a base saturation greater than 35 percent at 30 inches below the top of the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tangi soils are on side slopes, narrow ridge tops, and other erosional surfaces in the Southern Coastal Plain and the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in moderately thick deposits of weathered loess of siliceous mineralogy over loamy and clayey Coastal Plain sediments of early Pleistocene age.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 64 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bude, Guyton, Malbis, Ruston, Smithdale series and the competing Toula series.  Bude soils are on less convex slopes, have gray iron depletions in the upper 16 inches of the soil and are in lower positions.  The poorly drained Guyton soils are in flat depressional areas and do not have a fragipan.  Malbis, Ruston, and Smithdale soils are generally on more rolling parts of the same landscape. They are fine-loamy and do not have a fragipan."
