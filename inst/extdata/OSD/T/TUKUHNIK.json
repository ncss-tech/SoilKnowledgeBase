  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tukuhnik series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum derived dominantly from interbedded shale, siltstone and sandstone.  These soils are on cuestas and benches at elevations of 7,800 to 8,600 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  The argillic horizon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 62 degrees F.  These soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section more than half the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is higher than 41 degrees F.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  Depth to soft sandstone or shale is 40 to 60 inches.  Hues are 5YR or 7.5YR.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 30 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay and clay.  Rock fragments are 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  This horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay and clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles and cobbles.  This horizon is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
