  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in A horizon in 0.01M calcium chloride and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Cg horizon in water in its natural state.  Sulfur content ranges from a trace to 0.75 percent in all horizons.  The electrical conductivity of the saturation extract in mmhos/cm is more than 16 in all horizons.\nThe Oa or Oe horizon, where present, is less than 8 inches in thickness.  It has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  It is composed of sapric or hemic material.  Texture is muck, mucky-peat, or peat.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or their mucky analogs.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y to 5G, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 1.  It flows easily between fingers when squeezed.  The n value is more than 1.  Thin strata or lenses of fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam range from none to common.  Texture is clay.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 5.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand, a mixture of loamy fine sand, fine sand and shell fragments, stratified material of loamy fine sand, or fine sand and shells with thin discontinuous strata of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Caplen, Creole, Gentilly, Leerco, Mckee, and Riomar series in the same family.  All of these soils are in similar positions.  Caplen, Creole, Leerco, and Mckee soils do not have shells or shell fragments below a depth of 40 inches.  In addition, Creole soils have salinity from 4 to 16 dS/m. in surface layers.  Gentilly soils have an n value less than 1.0 throughout the soil.  Riomar soils are moderately deep to limestone bedrock"

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Turnbull soils are in tidal marsh areas of estuaries.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  Elevations are approximately sea level.  They formed in clayey and sandy estuarine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 71 to 73 degrees F."

They serve as a spawning area and are an important link in the food chain of many commercial and sport fin fish as well as shellfish.  Native vegetation consists of needlegrass rush, smooth cordgrass, bushy sea-oxeye, marshhay cordgrass, glasswort, bigleaf sumpweed, and seashore saltgrass."
