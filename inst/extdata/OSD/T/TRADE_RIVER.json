  "OVERVIEW": "The Trade River series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial aged alluvium over clayey lacustrine and in the underlying stratified calcareous silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on dissected glacial lake plains.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 millimeters (30 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C (42 degrees F).",
