  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Toklat soils occupy the outer portions of shallow depressions in outwash plains and low dune areas on the plains.  The depressions are subject to flooding in the spring during the period of snowmelt; which results in temporary saturation of the soils in the early summer.  As soon as the soil thaws completely, the water drains to low parts on the depression and to the deep general water table of the area.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, but water derived from snow in surrounding areas also passes through the Toklat soils."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bolio, Nenana, and Volkmar soils.  Bolio soils are in lower portions of the same depressions occupied by the Toklat soils, and are organic soils.  Nenana and Volkmar soils occupy surrounding terraces and dunes.  Nenana soils have a brown cambic horizon in loess over a sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum.  Volkmar soils have mottles in a silty high chroma matrix over a coarse-grained substratum."
