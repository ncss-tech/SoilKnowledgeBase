    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 degrees to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 63 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Coarse fragment content is typically less than 5 percent but ranges in some pedons from 0 to 15 percent and consists of gravel and channers.  Depth to horizons of continuous carbonate accumulation is 7 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is typically 28 to 35 inches but may range from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; values of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Textures are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Effervescence ranges from none to strong.  Salinity is 0 to 2 mmhos/cm.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; values of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist.  Textures are fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Structure is weak prismatic or weak subangular blocky.  Effervescence is slight to strong.  Salinity is 0 to 2 mmhos/cm.\nThe Cca horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y; values of 6 or 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist.  Textures are fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Effervescence is strong or violent.  Salinity is 0 to 4 mmhos/cm.  Carbonate equivalent ranges from 8 to 25 percent."

The soils formed in modified residuum and slopewash alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,300 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer air temperature is 61 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 80 to 110 days."
