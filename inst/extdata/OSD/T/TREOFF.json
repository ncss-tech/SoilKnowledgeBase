  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 5 to 14 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 145 to 192 days.  The soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section from April 15 to June 15 but are dry in all parts for 60 consecutive days following July 15 and 90 cumulative days from July 15 to October 25.  The particle-size control section is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, mainly angular pebbles or channers.\nThe Bw or AC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent angular pebbles or channers.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 2 to 10 percent.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, mainly angular pebbles or channers.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 2 to 10 percent and does not decrease with depth."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Treoff soils are on ridges, hillslopes, and other upland areas.  They formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from sandy shales and calcareous sandstone.  Slopes are both simple and complex and range from 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 19 inches of which about half falls as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 105 to 135 days."
