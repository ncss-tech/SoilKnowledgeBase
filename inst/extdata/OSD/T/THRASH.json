  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thrash soils are usually moist in all horizons, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and l2 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the 4 months following summer solstice. Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 49  to 53 F.  The particle-size control section contains 0 to 5 percent unweathered pebbles, ranging from 2 to 6 mm in diameter.  The soil is medium acid or slightly acid throughout the profile.\nThe  Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It has fine and medium granular or fine and medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It has weak or moderate fine, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure."

Coosbay, Hoquiam, Marty, and Tolke soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid in the control section.  Enola soils have a solum l2 to 30 inches thick and l5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Headley soils are silt loam throughout the particle-size control section.  Tebo soils have l5 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Thrash soils are on foothills and mountainous uplands at elevations of 400 to l,800 feet. Slopes are commonly convex and range from 8 to 30 percent. These soils formed in residuum from tuff breccia or waterlain bedded tuff of the lower member of the McIntosh formation with an admixture of weathered  volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is marine and characterized by cool, dry summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 75 to 85 inches.  Mean temperature in January is 38  F., mean temperature  in July is 65  F., mean annual temperature is about 52  F.  The growing season (28 F.) is l50 to 200 days."

Buckhorn, Lytell, Swem and Zenker soils have more than 35 percent weathered siltstone or sandstone fragments in the particle-size control section. Bunker soils have l5 to 35 percent basalt fragments in the particle-size control section.  Elochman soils have a loam B horizon and lack pebble-size fragments in the particle-size control section.  Katula soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
