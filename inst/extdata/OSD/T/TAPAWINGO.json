These soils have compacted layers. The soils were excavated and graded with dozer and earth moving pans. Tillage after soil grading has generally been restricted to the surface layer. The compacted layers have high bulk density which restricts root penetration and water movement in the soil.\nAp horizon:\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 3 to 6\nTexture: silt loam\nStructure: weak or moderate, fine to coarse, granular or subangular blocky\nRock fragment content: 1 to 5 percent\nReaction: moderately acid to neutral\nCA horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 to 8\nTexture: commonly silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam, loam or clay loam\nStructure: platy clods that are 0.6 to 5 cm (1/4 to 2 inches) thick with horizons cleavage planes and vertical cracks that are 2 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) apart and part to angular blocky clods\nConsistence: firm or very firm\nRock fragment content: 1 to 10 percent\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral\nCd horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 to 8\nTexture: commonly silt loam or silty clay loam and less commonly loam or clay loam\nStructure: platy clods that are 0.6 to 8 cm (1/4 to 3 inches) thick with horizontal cleavage plane and vertical cracks that are 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 inches) apart\nConsistence: very firm or extremely firm\nRock fragment content: 1 to 14 percent; common pockets and lenses of parachanners (shale) are mixed into the lower 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches)\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral\n2C horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 7\nChroma: 1 to 8\nTexture: commonly parachannery or very parachannery silt loam or silty clay loam\nConsistence: very firm to friable\nRock fragment content: 2 to 25 percent\nPararock fragment content: 20 to 60 percent parachanners\nReaction: mixed and ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline"

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chantilly (T), Hattontown (T), and Nawakwa series. Chantilly soils are formed entirely in residuum from Triassic sandstone and shale in MLRA 148. Hattontown soils are formed entirely in residuum for diabase and basalt in MLRA 148. Nawakwa soils have less than 51 cm (20 inches) of loamy soil materials over the graded shaley regolith."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tapawingo soils are typically on mined areas of till plains. They are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of reconstructed landforms. Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent. These soils formed in loamy soil materials that were excavated and reclaimed during surface mining. The upper 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of the regolith is mostly a mixture of soil materials from the pre-mined soils. The soil material is dominantly from loess and till. The lower part of the regolith consists mainly of soft shale with pockets of soil material of the pre-mined soils with minor amounts of sandstone and shale rock fragments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 122 to 244 meters (400 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Minnehaha, Nawakwa, and Hollybrook soils in mined areas, and the Ava, Hickory, Shakamak, and Vigo soils on till plains. The somewhat excessively drained Minnehaha soils are on backslopes of spoil hills. The somewhat poorly drained Hollybrook soils and the competing Nawakwa soils are on similar landform positions as the Tapawingo soils. The moderately well drained Ava and Shakamak soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes. The Hickory soils are on backslopes. The somewhat poorly drained Vigo soils are on nearly level summits."
