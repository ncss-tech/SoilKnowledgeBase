  "OVERVIEW": "The Tauncal series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and glaciofluvial sediments over a duripan.  Tauncal soils are on terraces and low hills and have slopes that range from 0 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches from about May 1 to October 1, unless irrigated.  Depth to a duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The solum is calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  It has coarse granular or coarse platy structure.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 5 percent.\nThe Bk horizon is 10YR or 2.5Y.  Value is 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, with chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  It has subangular blocky structure or is massive.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent."

Jestrick soils have a Bkq horizon with 15 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Oupico and Taunton soils have a non-calcareous surface layer.  Prineville soils are mildly alkaline above the duripan and have 5 to 25 percent sandy size pumice.  Shalake soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Skull Creek soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Ticeska soils have a Bkq horizon with calcium carbonate content of 15 to 30 percent."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a calcareous ochric epipedon from the surface to 13 inches, a zone of carbonate accumulation from 13 to 36 inches, and a duripan at 36 inches.   This soil has been mapped as the Burke or Taunton series. Land smoothing operations have since exposed calcareous subsoil layers, creating calcareous surface layers.  This soil is reclassified based on amendment 17 of Soil Taxonomy."
