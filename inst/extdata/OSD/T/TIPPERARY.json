  "OVERVIEW": "The Tipperary series consists of very deep somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian deposits or alluvium.  Tipperary soils are on benches, dunes, hillslopes, plateaus and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry.  They are moist in the moisture control section in April, May and early June. These soils typically effervesce at or near the surface but they may be leached of calcium carbonate as deep as 10 inches in some pedons.  The content of organic carbon ranges from .05 to 1 percent in the surface horizon and decreases uniformly with depth.  Electrical conductivity is typically less than 2 millimho/cm and exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from less than 1 to 10 percent throughout.  The particle size control section ranges from sand to loamy fine sand with strata of coarse sand in some pedons.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent but is typically less than 5 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.  and mean summer soil temperature from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The A horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline.  Usually it is single grain, but is weak granular in some pedons.  It is loose or soft when dry.\nThe Bk or Ck horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. This horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent typically ranges from less than 1 to 5  percent but some areas  may have inconsistent layers with up to 10 percent."

Als soils are non-effervescent.  Ecklund soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Hawsley, Isolde, and Tricera soils effervesce  at depths greater than 10 inches.  Kawich soils formed in pyroclastic material. Kewake soils contain 5 to 30 percent sand sized pumice.  Razito soils are intermittently moist is some part of the moisture control section from August to October.  Sheppard soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Stumble soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments and have a high proportion of volcanic ash, pumice, and pyroclastics.  Sundown soils have very strongly alkaline lower C horizons between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tipper soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Yenrab soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout."
