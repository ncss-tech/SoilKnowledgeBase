  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nTruefissure soils have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 37 to 43 degrees F. Average summer soil temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F. under varying density of forest canopy. Subsurface horizons are sometimes dry for 20 consecutive days and are usually dry for 40 cumulative days in July through October. The soils are moderately acid or slightly acid. The ash-rich loess mantle ranges from 16 to 24 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7.\nThe A and Bw horizons formed in the glass-rich mantle and have hue of 10YR through 5YR and chroma of 3 through 6. The A and Bw horizons have 5 to 10 percent clay and 70 to 85 percent silt plus very fine sand. Their very fine sand and fine sand fraction has 40 to 60 percent volcanic glass shards. These horizons have air dry bulk density of .65 to .85 grams per cc, base saturation of 15 to 40 percent and cation exchange capacity of 1.5 to 2.5 millequivalents per gram of clay including 3 to 5 percent organic matter. There are 1 to 5 percent pebbles, cobbles or stones in the upper part increasing to 5 to 25 percent in the lower part of the Bw horizon.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 3 through 6. It has air dry bulk density of 1.3 to 1.5 and cation exchange capacity of 1 to 5 milliequivalents per gram of clay This horizon has 3 to 7 percent clay and has 35 to 60 percent angular stones, cobbles and pebbles.\nThe 2C horizon has 60 to 80 percent angular stones, cobbles and pebbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Truefissure soils are on steep mountain slopes at elevations ranging from 4,500 to 8,000 feet under coniferous forest. They formed in a loess mantle, high in volcanic ash, superimposed over residuum and colluvium from argillites and quartzites. Mean annual precipitation is estimated to range from 50 to 70 inches with very deep winter snow cover. Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 35 to 45 degrees F. with mean summer temperature less than 50 degrees F. under forest cover."

Craddock, Holloway and Tamely soils are large area geographic associates whereas Wishard and Sherlock soils are more intimate topographic associates. Sherlock soils have accumulated clay in heavy loam beneath the Bir horizon."

(A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)\nThis draft reflects a change in classification from Medial over loamy-skeletal, mixed, Entic Cryandepts to Ashy over loamy-skeletal, glassy over isotic Typic Vitricryands\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data are available on two pedons from the NSSL. S64MT-061-001 and S64MT-061-002 and support the classification change. NaF pH data are lacking in the data set.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
