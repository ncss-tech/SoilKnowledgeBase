  "OVERVIEW": "The Tessfive series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous sediments with an admixture of loess.  These soils are on rolling hill crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
