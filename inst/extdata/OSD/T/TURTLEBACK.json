  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Billscabin, Doebay, and Inskip series. Billscabin soils are more than 150 cm deep to a paralithic contact. Doebay soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 cm. Inskip soils are 50 to 109 cm to a lithic contact with vesicular basaltic lava bedrock, and rock fragments are vesicular basalt from recent lava flows. Series with similar classification but mixed mineralogy include the Atring, Barpeak, Beekman, Farber, Firmountain, Forgay, Geppert, Half Dome, Hartless, Hilltish, Howler (T), Kanid, Kindig, Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron, Straight, Vena, and Woodin soils. Atring, Beekman, Firmountain, Geppert, Hilltish, Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron, Straight, Vena, and Woodin soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at 50 to 100 cm. Barpeak, Farber, Forgay, Half Dome, and Howler (T) soils are greater than 150 cm to a lithic contact. Hartless soils have a paralithic contact at 100 to greater than 150 cm. Kanid soils have a paralithic contact of fractured metamorphic sandstone at 100 to 150 cm, and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Kindig soils have a paralithic contact of weathered schist bedrock at 100 to 150 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Turtleback soils occur on mountain slopes and hillslopes at elevations of sea level to 730 meters. Slopes are 25 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift and bedrock of metasedimentary lithology. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 457 to 762 mm. Mean annual air temperature is 9 degrees C. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."
