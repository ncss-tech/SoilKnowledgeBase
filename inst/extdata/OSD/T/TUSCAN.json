    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum usually is less than 20 inches but ranges from 8 to 24 inches. The A horizons contain < 1 percent organic matter. The A1 horizons range in color from grayish brown (10YR) brown and dark brown (7.5YR) to reddish brown and yellowish red (5YR) in lower part; in texture from gravelly or cobbly loam to cobbly light clay loam; in structure from massive to granular; in reaction from slightly acid to strongly acid. The B2t horizon ranges in color from brown and dark brown (7.5YR) to reddish brown (5YR) and dark reddish brown to dark red (2.5YR); in texture from gravelly or cobbly heavy clay loam to gravelly clay, occasionally very gravelly clay; in structure from massive to strong prismatic or angular blocky; in reaction from medium acid to neutral (pH 6.0-7.0). Most profiles have a B1 horizon; these range from 2 to 7 inches thick."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

The Clough soils have abrupt AB boundaries and very gravelly, very strongly acid Bt horizons. The Gloria soils are moderately deep or deep to the duripan. The Igo soils lack argillic horizons. The Moda soils have abrupt AB boundaries and are brown or light brown.  The Palo Cedro soils are brown, have abrupt AB boundaries and strongly acid Bt horizons. The Redding soils are kaolinitic, have abrupt AB boundaries and medium to strongly acid Bt horizons. The San Joaquin soils have A1 horizons with pale colors (values 4 or more moist) and abrupt AB boundaries. Yokohl soils have abrupt AB boundaries."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tuscan soils occur on broad gently sloping old alluvial terraces that are hummocky or gently undulating. The alluvium was derived mostly from basalt, andesite and tuff. The soils occur at elevations of 200 to 1,000 feet in a subhumid climate with mean annual rainfall of 20 to 35 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 75 degrees F."
