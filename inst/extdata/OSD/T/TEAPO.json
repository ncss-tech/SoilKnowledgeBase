  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually calcareous at the surface, but they are leached for a few inches in some pedons. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Content of organic carbon ranges from .4 to 1 percent in the surface horizon and decreases uniformly with depth . The control section is typically sandy clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 45 to 70 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Rock fragments range from O to 15 percent, but are typically less than 10 percent . Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F. The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is slightly to strongly alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.6). This horizon usually has granular or crumb structure, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. It is soft or slightly hard. The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6). Visible secondary calcium carbonate may occur at any depth, but is not concentrated into a continuous horizon."

Greybull soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Hostage soils are deep. Montwel soils have hue of 5YR or redder, and have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Teapo soils are on gently to moderately sloping upland hills and ridges. Slope gradients typically range from 1 to about 20 percent. The soils formed in calcareous parent materials weathered residually from sedimentary bedrock. At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer months. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F."
