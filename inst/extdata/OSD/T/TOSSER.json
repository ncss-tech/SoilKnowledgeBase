  "OVERVIEW": "The Tosser series consists of very deep, well drained, soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from limestone, rhyolite and chert on dissected fan terraces, fan remnants, stream terraces, bars and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
