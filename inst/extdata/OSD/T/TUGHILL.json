  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 45 to 110 cm. Bedrock is at a depth greater than 152 cm. Redoximorphic features consisting of iron depletions and concentrations, and reduced matrices occur directly below the O or A horizon. Rock fragments, mainly stones, cobbles, and gravel, range from 3 to 65 percent by volume in the A and E horizons, and 35 to 75 percent in the B and C horizons.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is composed of fibric, hemic, or sapric material. It is massive or has granular structure. Reaction ranges from ultra acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon. It has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 or 2, or is N 2/0. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with or without mucky analogs. Some pedons have a BA horizon up to 18 cm thick with colors and textures similar to that of the A horizon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe E or Eg horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, has value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It has none to common redoximorphic concentrations. Texture is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe B or Bg horizon is neutral in color or has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It has none to many redoximorphic concentrations or depletions. Texture is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has weak or very weak, fine or medium subangular blocky or platy structure, or it is massive. It is very friable to firm. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon is neutral, or has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It has none to common redoximorphic concentrations or depletions. Texture is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is massive or has platy structure. It is friable to very firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons do not effervesce in lower substratum."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Brayton, Burnham, Cabot, Dannemora, Lyme, Peacham, Pillsbury, and Searsport series are similar soils in related families. Brayton and Burnham soils are coarse-loamy and have a lower organic matter content in the surface layer. Cabot and Peacham soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section. Dannemora soils have a fragipan horizon. Lyme and Pillsbury soils are more acid and have a coarse-loamy particle size control section. Searsport soils have a sandy particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tughill soils are in level to gently sloping depressional or low lying areas, partially-blocked drainageways, and beaver-impounded streams on till plains. These soils formed in till dominated by moderately coarse textured material from either acid siliceous rocks or sandstone, siltstone, shale. Some areas have stones or boulders on the surface resulting from fluvial scour by glacial melt water. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent but are mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1727 mm, mean annual air temperature ranges from 1 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 305 to 610 meters above sea level."

Fishcreek (T) and Swancott (T) soils are found on outwash plains and terraces derived from sandstones, siltstones and shale. Adirondack, Becket, Berkshire, Crary, Potsdam, Sabattis, Skerry, and Sunapee soils on surrounding higher landscapes in areas of granitic till. Adams and Colton soils are on associated nearby outwash terraces derived from acid siliceous material. Bucksport and Wonsqueak soils are associated organic soils."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: CEC activity class was estimated to be active. Further investigation is needed in the MLRA update process.\nThe Tughill series was a Half-Bog under the 1938 system. Presently, this soil is border line between a Typic Endoaquepts and a Histic Humaquepts. The existing extent of this series contains both classifications.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Albic horizon - from 8 to 19 cm (Eg horizon).\n2) Cambic Horizon - from 19 to 52 cm (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\n3) Endoaquepts great group - redoximorphic features directly below the O horizon, and an apparent water table within 15 cm deep from November through June.\n3) Redoximorphic features - Fe concentrations and depletions, and reduced matrices.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon #09NY049029\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
