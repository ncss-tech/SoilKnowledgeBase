    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Townsend soils are on hillslopes of glacial drift plains at elevations of 0 to 90 meters. They formed in eolian sands and glacial drift overlying dense glaciomarine sediments.  These soils are in a mild marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 460 to 635 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."
