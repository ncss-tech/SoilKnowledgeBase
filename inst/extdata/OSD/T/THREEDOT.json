  "OVERVIEW": "The Threedot series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till dominantly from quartzite.  Threedot soils are on moraines and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

Devoy, Embargo, Home camp, Spinlin, and Wilpar soils are moderately deep to paralithic or lithic contact.  Dryn soils have 12-15 inches precipitation.  Lemco soils have O horizons and greater than 22 inches percipitation.  Passar soils have coarse fragments greater than 10 inches in diameter in the control section.  Dryn, Redchief, Rooset, and Tatiyee soils lack an E horizon.  Redchief soils are strongly acid in the upper part of the argillic.  Rooset soils have secondary carbonates at 10 to 48 inches depth.  Tatiyee soils receive a dominance of precipitation in the spring and summer months.  Tellura and Wilpar soils lack B/E or E/B horizons and are well drained."
