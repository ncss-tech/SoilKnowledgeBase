Devoy, Embargo, Home camp, Spinlin, and Wilpar soils are moderately deep to paralithic or lithic contact.  Dryn soils have 12-15 inches precipitation.  Lemco soils have O horizons and greater than 22 inches percipitation.  Passar soils have coarse fragments greater than 10 inches in diameter in the control section.  Dryn, Redchief, Rooset, and Tatiyee soils lack an E horizon.  Redchief soils are strongly acid in the upper part of the argillic.  Rooset soils have secondary carbonates at 10 to 48 inches depth.  Tatiyee soils receive a dominance of precipitation in the spring and summer months.  Tellura and Wilpar soils lack B/E or E/B horizons and are well drained."

The soils formed in glacial till derived dominantly from quartzite.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 14 to 22 inches, and average annual temperature is 35 to 38 degrees.  The frost-free period is 10 to 60 days."
