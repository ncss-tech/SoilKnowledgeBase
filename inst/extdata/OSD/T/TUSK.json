Hades soils have an average annual soil temperature of 4 to 6 degrees C. and A1 horizons that are 50 to 97 cm thick.  Hurryback soils are slightly acid to neutral and the argillic horizon contains less than 35 percent rock fragments in all parts.  Krueger soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in B2t horizons and are dry 45 to 60 days following the summer solstice. Lagnaf soils have mollic epipedons that are 89 to 127 cm thick and are dry for less than 90 days.  Marotz and Sag soils are more than 50 cm deep to the argillic horizon. Moffspring soils have argillic horizon that are less than 41 cm thick, and is underlain by sand and gravel at moderate depth that contain 35 to 65 percent coarse fragments. Nagle soils are calcareous at depths of 43 to 56 cm.  Strom series contain mottles at 30 to 45 cm and is saturated with water during the winter, spring and early summer, and have a water table at 61 cm."
