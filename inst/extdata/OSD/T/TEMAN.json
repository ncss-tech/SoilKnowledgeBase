It has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and 5 to 30 percent 3 to 5 mm carbonate concretions.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, usually more alkaline with increasing depth.\nSalts and sodium: Normally strongly salt and slightly sodium affected at depths below 20 cm, and free or slightly affected above.  Some pedons are strongly salt and moderately sodium affected throughout the profile.\nGypsum: Segregated gypsum crystals are common at any depth below 18 cm.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 20 to 30 percent.\nSand fraction:  Less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nRock fragments: Some pedons have up to 10 percent gravel below a depth of 100 cm.\nA horizon\nHue:  2.5Y or 10YR\nValue:  3 through 5 moist.\nChroma:  2 through 4.\nStructure:  Very thin to thick platy or prismatic or it is massive.\nBq and Bk horizons\nValue:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 8 moist, light values are in the lower subhorizons.\nChroma:  1 through 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nTexture:  Silt loam or silty clay loam.\nCementation:  20 to 50 percent weak and moderately strong durinodes.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teman soils are on smooth inset fans and some fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks mostly of volcanic origin that are high in pyroclastics.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,375 to 1,475 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."

Broyles, Creemon, and Whirlo soils have cambic horizons and do not have calcic horizons.  Duffer soils have carbonatic mineralogy and are saturated within a depth of 100 cm.  Landco soils have coarse-silty over clayey particle-size control sections and do not have durinodes and calcic horizons."
