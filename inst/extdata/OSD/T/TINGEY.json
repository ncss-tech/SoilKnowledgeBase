  "OVERVIEW": "The Tingey soils consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from sandstone and limestone.  These soils are on steep and very steep mountain slopes.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",
