  "STATES": "ID,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Timmerman series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in glacial outwash and alluvium mixed with loess in the upper part.  Timmerman soils are on outwash plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

These soils are moist in the winter and spring but are dry more than one half of the time the soil temperature exceeds 40 degrees F., about 105 to 130 consecutive days.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages loamy sand or sand.  Depth to underlying coarse textured Bk horizon and depth to secondary carbonates is 13 to 30 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry or moist.  It is coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 3 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is coarse sand or loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent.  This horizon is slightly to strongly alkaline.  In some pedons, it contains subhorizons that are fine gravelly."

The soils formed in glacial outwash and alluvium mixed with loess in the upper part.  Timmerman soils are in an arid climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The average January temperature is 27 degrees F.  The average July temperature is 77 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 210 days."
