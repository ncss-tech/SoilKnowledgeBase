  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 100 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent in the solum and 0 to 15 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the surface layer, strongly acid to neutral in the subsoil, and from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum. Below a depth of 100 centimeters from the surface, some pedons range to moderately alkaline and are effervescent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam or loam. Some pedons have a thin A horizon or AB horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. The matrix has a chroma of 3 or greater immediately below the A or Ap or to a depth of greater than 25 centimeters below the mineral surface. Texture is silt loam, loam, silt, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Thin layers, 2 to 7 centimeters thick, of sand or gravelly sand, and silty clay loam are in some pedons. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium, granular or subangular blocky. Some B horizons have prismatic structure. Consistence is very friable to firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam. Thin strata of sand to fine sandy loam or silty clay loam are in some pedons. It is massive or has plate-like divisions. Consistence is loose to firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nMassena, Munson, Raypol, Scantic, Scitico, Wallington, and Walpole soils are similar soils in related families.. Massena soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser including gravel in the particle size control section. Munson, Scantic, and Scitico soils have more than 18 percent clay in the lower part of the control section. Raypol soils are more acid. Wallington soils have a fragipan. Walpole soils have more than 70 percent fine sand or coarser in the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tonawanda soils are level to strongly sloping soils on glacial lake plains and terraces. They are in depressions and drainageways and on side slopes of swells and knolls. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in silty estuarine or glaciolacustrine deposits. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 1270millimeters and the mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees Celsius. The frost-free season ranges from 105 to 180 days."

The well drained Hartland and Unadilla, moderately well drained Belgrade and Scio, poorly and very poorly drained Canandaigua, and very poorly drained Birdsall soils are in a drainage sequence with Tonowanda soils. The Eldridge, Enosburg, Munson, Raypol, and Walpole soils are on nearby terraces or lake plains. Eldridge and Enosburg soils have sandy solums. Raypol and Walpole soils have sandy substrata."

The Tonowanda series was reactivated with the correlation of Cattaraugus County, NY 2002.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 56 centimeters (Bw and Bg horizons).\nc. Aeric feature - in 50 percent or more of the matrix, a hue of 10YR or yellower and a value and chroma, moist, of 3 or more (Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
