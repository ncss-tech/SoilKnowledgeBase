  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonawanda series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty estaurine or glaciolacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains and terraces. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees Celsius.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 100 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent in the solum and 0 to 15 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the surface layer, strongly acid to neutral in the subsoil, and from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum. Below a depth of 100 centimeters from the surface, some pedons range to moderately alkaline and are effervescent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam or loam. Some pedons have a thin A horizon or AB horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. The matrix has a chroma of 3 or greater immediately below the A or Ap or to a depth of greater than 25 centimeters below the mineral surface. Texture is silt loam, loam, silt, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Thin layers, 2 to 7 centimeters thick, of sand or gravelly sand, and silty clay loam are in some pedons. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium, granular or subangular blocky. Some B horizons have prismatic structure. Consistence is very friable to firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam. Thin strata of sand to fine sandy loam or silty clay loam are in some pedons. It is massive or has plate-like divisions. Consistence is loose to firm."

Massena soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser including gravel in the particle size control section. Munson, Scantic, and Scitico soils have more than 18 percent clay in the lower part of the control section. Raypol soils are more acid. Wallington soils have a fragipan. Walpole soils have more than 70 percent fine sand or coarser in the substratum."

The Tonowanda series was reactivated with the correlation of Cattaraugus County, NY 2002.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 56 centimeters (Bw and Bg horizons).\nc. Aeric feature - in 50 percent or more of the matrix, a hue of 10YR or yellower and a value and chroma, moist, of 3 or more (Bw horizon)."
