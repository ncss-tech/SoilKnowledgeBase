    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to horizons with an alkaline reaction ranges from 10 to 35 inches. Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 50 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silty clay or clay. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redox depletions and redox accumulations range from none to common. The lower part has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redox depletions and redox accumulations range from few to many. Texture of the Bw horizon is silty clay or clay. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon, present in most pedons, has the same range in color as the lower part of the Bw horizon. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Soft masses and/or nodules of calcium carbonate range from none to common.\nThe 2C horizon is commonly stratified. It commonly has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, and less commonly has hue of 7.5YR; value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6; or it has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of olive, brown, and gray. It is massive or has platy or blocky rock structure. Texture is sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It commonly contains few to many angular, soft shale-like fragments. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Soft masses and/or nodules of calcium carbonate range from few to many. Soft black masses or stains (Fe & Mn oxides) range from none to common. Some pedons have strata of chalk or marl below a depth of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toxey soils are on ridgetops and benches on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain associated with the Jackson Prairie. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. They formed in thin layers of acid clay and stratified loamy and clayey alkaline sediments and chalk of the middle Tertiary period. The climate is warm and humid. The average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 67 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brantley, Hannon, and Okeelala soils. Brantley and Hannon soils are on similar positons as Toxey soils. Brantley soils have a clayey argillic horizon and are acid throughout. Hannon soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the upper part of the solum. Okeelala soils are on lower positions than Toxey soils and are fine-loamy."
