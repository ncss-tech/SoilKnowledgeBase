  "STATES": "AL,MS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Toxey series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils on upland ridges and benches. They formed in thin layers of acid clay underlain by stratified, alkaline, loamy and clayey sediments, and chalk or marl. The average annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 58 inches. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.",
