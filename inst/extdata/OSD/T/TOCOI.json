In addition, Delks soils have an E horizon above the Bh horizon, the poorly and very poorly drained Pomona soils have an E horizon above the Bh horizon and lack an umbric epipedon, Susanna and Tantile soils have an E horizon above the Bh horizon and have orstein, while Wauchula soils lack umbric epipedons and have argillic horizons at depths of less than 40 inches from the surface.  The very poorly drained Monteocha soils are in lower positions, have E horizons above the Bh horizon, and have greater than 15 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
