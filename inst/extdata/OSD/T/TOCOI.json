  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tocoi series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on broad flats in the lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
