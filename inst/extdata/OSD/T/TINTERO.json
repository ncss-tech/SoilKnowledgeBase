Betonnie soils are slightly cooler and receive more effective winter moisture.  Bijou, Terro, Terry, and Vonalee soils typically have yellower hues. Terro and Terry soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches. In addition, Bijou, Terro, Terry, and Vonalee soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June"
