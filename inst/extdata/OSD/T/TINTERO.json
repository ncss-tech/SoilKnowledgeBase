  "OVERVIEW": "The Tintero series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium, fan alluvium, and slope alluvium derived from sandstone. Tintero soils are on mesas, cuestas and fan terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Betonnie soils are slightly cooler and receive more effective winter moisture.  Bijou, Terro, Terry, and Vonalee soils typically have yellower hues. Terro and Terry soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches. In addition, Bijou, Terro, Terry, and Vonalee soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June"
