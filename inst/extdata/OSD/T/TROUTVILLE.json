  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon from the mineral surface is less than 24 inches, and depth from the mineral surface to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 55 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period of nearly every year.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically extremely stony sandy loam containing lamellae of sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam.  When mixed, texture is no coarser than sandy loam.  This horizon ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  Lamellae 1cm or more thick comprise 6 to 8 inch thickness in this horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically extremely stony sandy loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 30 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline."

Hyannis, Siebert, and Yochum soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Ceebee and Origo soils have less than 60 percent base saturation in their Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Troutville soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, glacial moraines, eskers, till plains, and mountainsides.  Slopes gradients range from 2 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in thick stony, moderately coarse-textured, transported material derived from mixed rock sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches and about 11 inches of this falls during the months of April through August.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 38 degrees F.  In Wyoming, mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  Elevation ranges from 8,000 feet to 11,400 feet in more southerly latitudes in the state.  Frost free period is 10 to 60 days."
