  "OVERVIEW": "The Tablerock series consists of deep, moderately well drained\nsoils that formed in colluvium weathered from basalt, andesite,\nand sandstone.  Tablerock soils are on hillslopes and alluvial\nfans and have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual\nprecipitation is about 23 inches.",
