  "OVERVIEW": "The Twick series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in fine textured alluvium and residuum derived from shale.  Twick soils are on upland hilly terrain and have slopes of 5 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
