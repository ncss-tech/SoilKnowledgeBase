Fajada, Hadden, and Muff soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Highrock soils lack prismatic structure in the natric horizons and have a SAR in excess of 40. Homko soils have horizons with secondary gypsum below the natric horizon. Leebench soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments between the base of the natric horizon and 40 inches. Leeko soils have horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments between 40 and 60 inches. Pizene soils are 12 to 18 inches to free carbonates and have a C horizon with sandy loam or fine sandy loam textures and lacks silty lacustrine deposits in the lower profile.  Recapture soils lack a calic horizon and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Rusty soils lack a calcic horizon and have C horizons within 40 inches that are stratified lacustrine sand to silt loam. Swasey soils lack a calcic horizon and are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Terlco soils have horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments. Uffens soils do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thermosprings soils are on alluvial flats, lake terraces, and alluvial plains at elevations of 4,600 to 5,150 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived dominantly from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks. In some areas, recent wind- or water-deposited sediments overlie the sodium affected material. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F. and the average summer air temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Manselo, Sevy, Taylorsflat, the competing Uvada, and Woodrow soils. Manselo, Sevy and Taylorsflat soils do not have a natric horizon and usually occur at slightly higher elevations on the landscape. Uvada soils occur at slightly lower elevations and/or in concave positions. Woodrow soils do not have a natric horizon, are fine-silty in the particle-size control section, and have an irregular decrease in organic matter content with depth. Woodrow soils occur in flood plains."
