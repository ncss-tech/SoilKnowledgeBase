    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  The maximum thickness of mollic colors ranges from 24 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam, but some pedons are coarser textured when mantled by sandy eolian material. It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Few to many, distinct to prominent redox features are in some pedons.  The lower boundary ranges from abrupt wavy to clear wavy or irregular with tongues of A extending into the E horizon 1 or 2 inches in most pedons.  Some pedons have A/E horizons.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is silt loam, but also included is loam and silty clay loam.  Bright brownish redox features are in some pedons. It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E/B horizon has colors and textures similar to the E and Bt horizons.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have a B/E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry; and chroma of 2 or less. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg and Bkg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  They are clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay and range from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nWhere present, the C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay, and clay loam.  Some pedons are underlain by stratified lenses of sandy loam or loam.  The C horizon has few or common, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate in most pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline. Accumulations of gypsum are in the Bg, Bkg, and C horizons of some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tetonka soils are in flat closed depressions and in wide flat-bottomed drainageways in the glacial till plains. Slopes are less than 2 percent.  They formed in local alluvial sediments overlying glacial till.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches. Growing season is about 120 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

Chancellor and Crossplain soils do not have E horizons and are in slightly higher positions.  The well drained Clarno, Egan, Ethan, Houdek, and Wentworth soils are on steeper higher positions.  Prosper and Onita soils do not have E horizons and are in swales and shallow drainageways.  In addition, Prosper soils are fine-loamy.  Stickney soils have a natric horizon and are on slightly higher positions.  The moderately well drained, fine-silty Viborg soils are in slight depressions and swales. Davison, Harps, and Wakonda soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches and are at edges of depressions.  Worthing soils do not have E horizons and are in the lower, more poorly drained positions."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  These soils are ponded after heavy rains and melt waters from snow.  Surface drainage is ponded.  These soils typically are wet except in late summer and fall unless they have been drained.  Permeability is slow.  Water tables range from 1 foot above the surface to 4 feet below the surface in the spring of most years."
