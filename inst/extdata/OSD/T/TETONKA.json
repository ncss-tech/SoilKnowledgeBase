The maximum thickness of mollic colors ranges from 24 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam, but some pedons are coarser textured when mantled by sandy eolian material. It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Few to many, distinct to prominent redox features are in some pedons.  The lower boundary ranges from abrupt wavy to clear wavy or irregular with tongues of A extending into the E horizon 1 or 2 inches in most pedons.  Some pedons have A/E horizons.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is silt loam, but also included is loam and silty clay loam.  Bright brownish redox features are in some pedons. It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E/B horizon has colors and textures similar to the E and Bt horizons.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have a B/E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry; and chroma of 2 or less.

Prosper and Onita soils do not have E horizons and are in swales and shallow drainageways.  In addition, Prosper soils are fine-loamy.  Stickney soils have a natric horizon and are on slightly higher positions.  The moderately well drained, fine-silty Viborg soils are in slight depressions and swales. Davison, Harps, and Wakonda soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches and are at edges of depressions.  Worthing soils do not have E horizons and are in the lower, more poorly drained positions."
