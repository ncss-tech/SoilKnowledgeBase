  "OVERVIEW": "The Twickenham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey colluvium from the John Day and Clarno Formations.  They are on south slopes and on rolling ridgetops.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section is silty clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.  An abrupt increase in clay of 15 to 30 percent or more exists between the A horizon and the 2Bt horizon.  Coarse fragments are either basalt from the Columbia River Basalt flows or conglomerates from the Clarno Formation.  The tuffaceous sediments of the John Day and Clarno Formations have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y with the hue of 5YR or 7.5YR the most common.  The depth to secondary carbonates is 12 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam with 8 to 27 percent clay  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 5 to 40 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon (when present) has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 3Bk horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay with 30 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 25 percent stones, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent gravel, but averages 15 to 50 percent total rock fragments.  Some pedons have 0 to 20 percent paragravels in the lower part of the horizon."

Day soils are on saddles and sideslopes, are in the very-fine family, and have intersecting slickensides.  Buffaran soils are on fan piedmont remnants and are shallow to a duripan.  Gwinly soils are on convex sideslopes near rock outcrops, are clayey-skeletal, and are shallow to bedrock.  Simas soils are on north slopes and have a mollic epipedon.  Cooperopolis soils are on gently sloping, north slopes, are in the loamy family, and are shallow to bedrock."
