  "OVERVIEW": "The Topia series consists of well drained, very slowly permeable soils that are moderately deep over limestone bedrock. The soils formed in clayey pedisediment over residuum from limestone bedrock. The soils occur on nearly level to gently undulating ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).",
