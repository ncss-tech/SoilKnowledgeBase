The Dunbar, Kinta, and Lenoir\nsoils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.\nFalkner and Muskogee soils have a base saturation of 35 percent or more at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Muskogee soils have mixed mineralogy.  The Exum, Felker, Kullit, and Tiak soils lack dominant colors of chroma 2 or less within the B horizon.  In addition, the Kullit soils have more\nthan 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  Tiak soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Nahunta soils lack hues redder than 10YR as matrix colors in the Bt\nhorizons.  In addition, they contain a few plinthic nodules in the lower part."
