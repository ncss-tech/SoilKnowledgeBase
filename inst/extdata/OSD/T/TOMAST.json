Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A1 horizon and strongly acid to very strongly acid below.  Within the control section, clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent and the silt content is more than 30 percent.\nThe A1 horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or dark\ngrayish brown (10YR 4/2).  The A2 horizon is brown (10YR 4/3,\n5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4).  The A horizon is loam or silt loam.\nThe B1t horizon is yellowish red (5YR 5/6) or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6).  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  The B21t horizon is strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), or reddish\nyellow (7.5YR 6/6, 6/8) with mottles in shades of gray and yellow.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  The Btg horizons are gray\n(10YR 6/1) or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) with mottles in\nshades of red, brown, or yellow.  They are silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Slickensides are present below 60 inches in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon is coarsely mottled in shades of red, brown, or\ngray."

Coxville, Grady, Grantham, Rains, Rufe, and Trebloc soils lack chromas of 3 or more within the upper Bt horizon.  In addition,\nthe Coxville and Grady soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  The Grantham and Rains soils have more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand in the control\nsection.  The Dunbar, Kinta, and Lenoir\nsoils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.\nFalkner and Muskogee soils have a base saturation of 35 percent or more at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Muskogee soils have mixed mineralogy.  The Exum, Felker, Kullit, and Tiak soils lack dominant colors of chroma 2 or less within the B horizon.  In addition, the Kullit soils have more\nthan 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  Tiak soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Nahunta soils lack hues redder than 10YR as matrix colors in the Bt\nhorizons.  In addition, they contain a few plinthic nodules in the lower part."
