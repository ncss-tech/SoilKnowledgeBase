  "OVERVIEW": "The Tulebasin series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from diatoms and volcanic ash.  These soils are in lake basins and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
