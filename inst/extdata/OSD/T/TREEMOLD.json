  "OVERVIEW": "The Treemold series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra.  They are on basalt plains associated with recent lava flows.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Permeability is moderate. Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
