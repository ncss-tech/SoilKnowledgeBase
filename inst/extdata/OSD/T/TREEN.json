The areas where these soils occur are sometimes referred to as mountain meadows.  Slopes range from 0 to 90 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with residuum and colluvium.  The mean annual air temperature is 0 to 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1500 to 3500 millimeters.  Frost-free season is 30 to 90 days."
