  "OVERVIEW": "The Treen series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from a wide variety of rock types with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Treen soils are on valley walls, ridges, and cirque basins.  Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent on valley walls and 0 to 15 percent on ridges and in cirque basins.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2500 millimeters. The mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

The mean annual air temperature is 0 to 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1500 to 3500 millimeters.  Frost-free season is 30 to 90 days."
