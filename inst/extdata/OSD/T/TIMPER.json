  "OVERVIEW": "The Timper series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Timper soils are on fan skirts, fan piedmonts and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
