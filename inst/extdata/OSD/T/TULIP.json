They formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of colluvium and the underlying paleosol in residuum from shale of Mississippi age. Slopes range from 12 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches) and mean annual temperature ranges from about 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The base saturation at the critical depth is near the 35 percent break between alfisols and ultisols. As additional data is acquired the classification may change from a Hapludult to a Hapludalf.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available at the National Soil Survey Laboratory: two pedons from Owen County, IN S90IN119-46 and S93IN119-34, typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
