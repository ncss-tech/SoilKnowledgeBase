  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Treon series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from underlying fine grained sandstone. Treon soils are on upland plains, dissected ridges, structural benches and escarpments.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.)",
