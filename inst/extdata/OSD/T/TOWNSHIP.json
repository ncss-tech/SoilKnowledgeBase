  "OVERVIEW": "The Township series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from schist and gneiss that are high in mica, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. They are located on mountain slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 10 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
