  "OVERVIEW": "The Truchot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous gravelly alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, and sandstone.  These soils are in closed depressions, dissected alluvial fans, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
