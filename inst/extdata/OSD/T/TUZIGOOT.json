  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuzigoot series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from lacustrine sediments.  Tuzigoot soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
