    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  The soil is calcareous throughout.  The texture is silty clay or clay throughout.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay.  Carbonate concretions range from few to many.  In cultivated areas the gilgai (microrelief) is difficult to identify.  The active slickenside zone extends to 60 inches or more.  Most slickensides are oriented at angles of 35 to 50 degrees.  Some slickensides are continuous for 4 to 8 feet or more.  The cycle of microbasin to microbasin is repeated every 8 to 12 feet.  Intersecting slickensides begin at 8 to 24 inches below the surface.\nThe A horizon has matrix colors of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chromas of 1 to 3.  Iron accumulation and reductions, where present, are in shades of gray and brown.\nBssg and Bg horizons have matrix colors of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, values of 3 or 4, and chroma 1 or 2, or neurtal with values of 3 or 4.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray, olive, brown, or red.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has matrix colors of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chroma 1 or 2, or neurtal with values of 3 to 5.

Average annual temperature near the type location is about 63 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is about 49 inches."

They do not contain intersecting slickensides and are not calcareous throughout.  Marietta soils occur on similar flood plains.  They are moderately well drained and in a fine-loamy particle-size class and more acid throughout.  Sumter soils occur on adjacent uplands.  They are moderately deep to chalk or marl at 20 to 40 inches and have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Tuscumbia and Una soils occur on similar flood plains.  They do not contain intersecting slickensides, are not calcareous and more acid throughout."
