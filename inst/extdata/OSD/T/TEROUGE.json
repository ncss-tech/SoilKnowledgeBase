  "OVERVIEW": "The Terouge series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey alluvium.  These soils are on level to nearly level flood plains and low terraces of streams that drain Blackland uplands, MLRA 135.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

The soil is calcareous throughout.  The texture is silty clay or clay throughout.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay.  Carbonate concretions range from few to many.  In cultivated areas the gilgai (microrelief) is difficult to identify.  The active slickenside zone extends to 60 inches or more.  Most slickensides are oriented at angles of 35 to 50 degrees.  Some slickensides are continuous for 4 to 8 feet or more.  The cycle of microbasin to microbasin is repeated every 8 to 12 feet.  Intersecting slickensides begin at 8 to 24 inches below the surface.\nThe A horizon has matrix colors of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chromas of 1 to 3.  Iron accumulation and reductions, where present, are in shades of gray and brown.\nBssg and Bg horizons have matrix colors of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, values of 3 or 4, and chroma 1 or 2, or neurtal with values of 3 or 4.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray, olive, brown, or red.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has matrix colors of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chroma 1 or 2, or neurtal with values of 3 to 5.
