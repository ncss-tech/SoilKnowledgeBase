  "OVERVIEW": "The Tommycork series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on backslopes of dissected basalt plateaus. Tommycork soils formed in colluvium from basalt with loess and a small amount of volcanic ash in surface horizons. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual temperature about 43 degrees F.",

The Tommycork Series lacks the distinct mixed volcanic ash surface (lower glass content) and consequently no lithologic discontinuity is recognized. Although both series have the same classification, the distinctness in the amount of ash is recognizable in the field. Additional review maybe needed for separation of Tommycork from Powellbutte series if they occur on the same landscape position with similar production and vegetative communities (interpretations). It maybe recommended to revise the Vitrandic subgroup criteria (increase the glass content criteria) if no interpretative value can be shown.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
