The Tommycork Series lacks the distinct mixed volcanic ash surface (lower glass content) and consequently no lithologic discontinuity is recognized. Although both series have the same classification, the distinctness in the amount of ash is recognizable in the field. Additional review maybe needed for separation of Tommycork from Powellbutte series if they occur on the same landscape position with similar production and vegetative communities (interpretations). It maybe recommended to revise the Vitrandic subgroup criteria (increase the glass content criteria) if no interpretative value can be shown.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
