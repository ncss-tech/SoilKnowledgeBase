  "OVERVIEW": "The Teton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium from sandstone.  These soils are on hills and mountains  Slopes are 2 to 65  percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
