The 6 to 18 inch soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from June through October unless irrigated and is moist in some or all parts from November thru May. Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/2 or 5/3 and moist colors of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist colors of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 3/3 or 3/4.
