  "OVERVIEW": "The Trebor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from limestone.  They have moderately slow permeability in the solum and moderate permeability in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
