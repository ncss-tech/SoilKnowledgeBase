  "OVERVIEW": "The Tigley series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foothills, dissected terraces, escarpments, and breaklands. They formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary rock, with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 80 percent. Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 34 inches.",
