    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tigley soils are on south-facing foothills, dissected terraces, escarpments, and breaklands. Slopes range from 15 to 80 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and old alluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary rock, with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevation ranges from 2,160 to 4,200 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches. The average frost-free period is from 80 to 120 days."

Ahrs soils are on east and west-facing adjacent mountain slopes and do not have an argillic horizon. Hugus soils are on north-facing foothills and terrace slopes, and have a thick volcanic ash mantle. Lotuspoint soils are on south-facing canyonsides and ridges, and have hard bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and are mesic. Pinecreek soils are on south-facing adjacent mountain slopes and do not have argillic horizons."
