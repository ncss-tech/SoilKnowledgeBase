  "STATES": "OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Thrifton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow to dense till. These soils formed in till and have been extensively eroded due to cultural practices. They are on moraines. Slope ranges from 6 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Celina soils are moderately well drained and have more clay in the subsoil and are generally in less sloping positions. The moderately well drained Miami and well drained Miamian soils have carbonates at deeper depths and are on similar landscape positions."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately slow above the dense till and slow in the dense till."
