    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. In closely related families are the Losantville and Wapahani series. Losantville soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are in the clayey particle-size class. Wapahani soils are in the active cation-exchange activity class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thrifton soils are on moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 6 to 50 percent. The soils formed in till and have been extensively eroded due to cultural practices. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Celina, Miami, and Miamian soils. Celina soils are moderately well drained and have more clay in the subsoil and are generally in less sloping positions. The moderately well drained Miami and well drained Miamian soils have carbonates at deeper depths and are on similar landscape positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately slow above the dense till and slow in the dense till."
