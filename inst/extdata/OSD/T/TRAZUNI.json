  "OVERVIEW": "The Trazuni series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvial materials derived from sandstone. Trazuni soils are on mesas, cuestas and hills. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

(C2 horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nBecause this soil was not correlated (established) when the McKinley County Area was correlated in 2001, it may have slipped through the cracks and should have been dropped. Need for this series should be evaluated during the update of MLRA 35 and proper disposition made then.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
