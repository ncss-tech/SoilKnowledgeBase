(A and Bw horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 12 to 39 inches. (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nThe presence of rust colored mottles at 47 inches. (C2 horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nBecause this soil was not correlated (established) when the McKinley County Area was correlated in 2001, it may have slipped through the cracks and should have been dropped. Need for this series should be evaluated during the update of MLRA 35 and proper disposition made then.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
