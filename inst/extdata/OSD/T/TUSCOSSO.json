  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuscosso series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in recent clayey alluvial deposits. These soils are on nearly level bottomlands that drain areas of reddish soils such as the Nacogdoches and Trawick series. These soils flood almost every year for a duration of usually less than 2 days. The slope is less than 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Average clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 35 to 55 percent and the silt content ranges from 25 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon is less than 20 inches thick. It is dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 3/3), brown (10YR 4/3), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3, 3/4), reddish brown (5YR 4/4), yellowish red (5YR 4/6), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2). It lacks the combination of dark colors and thickness to qualify as a Mollic epipedon. The texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has colors of yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8), brown (7.5Y 5/4), brown (7.5YR 4/4), red (2.5YR 4/6), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8) in the matrix. Iron depletions in shades of brown (10YR 5/3), and iron accumulations in shades of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) occur throughout this horizon. Iron depletions in shades of gray and olive are at depths greater than 24 inches. The texture is clay loam, clay, or silty clay. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has the same range of color as the B2 horizon. In most pedons the lower C horizons contain gypsum crystals."
