  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Average clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 35 to 55 percent and the silt content ranges from 25 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon is less than 20 inches thick. It is dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 3/3), brown (10YR 4/3), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3, 3/4), reddish brown (5YR 4/4), yellowish red (5YR 4/6), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2). It lacks the combination of dark colors and thickness to qualify as a Mollic epipedon. The texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has colors of yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8), brown (7.5Y 5/4), brown (7.5YR 4/4), red (2.5YR 4/6), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8) in the matrix. Iron depletions in shades of brown (10YR 5/3), and iron accumulations in shades of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) occur throughout this horizon. Iron depletions in shades of gray and olive are at depths greater than 24 inches. The texture is clay loam, clay, or silty clay. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has the same range of color as the B2 horizon. In most pedons the lower C horizons contain gypsum crystals."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils flood almost annually for a duration of less than 2 days. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 50 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 69 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."
