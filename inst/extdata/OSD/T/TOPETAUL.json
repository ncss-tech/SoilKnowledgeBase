  "OVERVIEW": "The Topetaul series consists of very deep, well drained and slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from shale.  Topetaul soils are on cuestas.  Slopes are 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about l7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
