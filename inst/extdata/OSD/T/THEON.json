  "OVERVIEW": "The Theon series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Theon soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Hoot soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C. and have an A2 horizon.  Mirkwood soils do not have abrupt boundaries between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon.  Tognoni soils have argillic horizons with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Valleycity soils have particle-size control section which are dominated by stones and have BCk horizons.  Waucoba soils have lithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm."
