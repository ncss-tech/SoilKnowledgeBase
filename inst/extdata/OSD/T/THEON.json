Hoot soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C. and have an A2 horizon.  Mirkwood soils do not have abrupt boundaries between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon.  Tognoni soils have argillic horizons with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Valleycity soils have particle-size control section which are dominated by stones and have BCk horizons.  Waucoba soils have lithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm."

Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,012 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
