  "OVERVIEW": "The Teeters series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty diatomaceous sediments.  Teeters soils are on flood plains or drained lake bottoms and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soils are moistened throughout by a water table.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The A horizon is strongly or very strongly alkaline and alkalinity decreases with depth below 20 inches in the profile.  The soil is calcareous in all parts at depths between 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 24 inches thick.  Estimated bulk density at 1/3 bar water retention is 0.4 to 0.7 gm/cc.  The exchange complex is dominated by amorphous materials and the soils have high amounts of diatoms and sponge spicules.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 or 1 moist or dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of neutral, 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5YR, value of 2 through 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry.  Mottles have moist value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is silt or silt loam."
