  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to more than 70 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless the surface has been limed.  Content of mica flakes ranges from few to many throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Many pedons have few or common mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray in the Bw horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles with chroma of 3 or more range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have few to many mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray.  Texture is variable, but is typically loamy or sandy."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing soils, these include the Biltmore, Cullowhee, Dillard, Rosman, Reddies, Statler,and Toxaway soils.  Rosman is in a similar landscape position as Transylvania soils.  Biltmore soils are in a sandy family and are in a natural levee position beside the stream channel of large streams.  Cullowhee and Reddies soils are along narrow flood plains where the loamy alluvium is moderately deep to gravel beds.  These soils are in a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal family.  Dillard and Staler soils have argillic horizons and are on nearby stream terraces.  Toxaway soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions and backwater areas of the flood plains."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of these soils are cleared and used for cultivated crops or pasture.  Corn, vegetables, and grass and clover are the main crops grown.  Native vegetation consists of mixed hardwoods and include red maple, river birch, American sycamore, yellow poplar, eastern white pine, and American beech.  Understory plants include greenbrier, hobblebush, rhododendron, mountain laurel, flowering dogwood, sourwood, eastern hophornbeam."
