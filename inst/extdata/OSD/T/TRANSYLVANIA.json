  "STATES": "GA,NC,SC,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Transylvania series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits.  They are on nearly level flood plains of mountain valleys in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 63 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to more than 70 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless the surface has been limed.  Content of mica flakes ranges from few to many throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Many pedons have few or common mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray in the Bw horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles with chroma of 3 or more range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have few to many mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray.  Texture is variable, but is typically loamy or sandy."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing soils, these include the Biltmore, Cullowhee, Dillard, Rosman, Reddies, Statler,and Toxaway soils.  Rosman is in a similar landscape position as Transylvania soils.  Biltmore soils are in a sandy family and are in a natural levee position beside the stream channel of large streams.  Cullowhee and Reddies soils are along narrow flood plains where the loamy alluvium is moderately deep to gravel beds.  These soils are in a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal family.  Dillard and Staler soils have argillic horizons and are on nearby stream terraces.  Toxaway soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions and backwater areas of the flood plains."

Understory plants include greenbrier, hobblebush, rhododendron, mountain laurel, flowering dogwood, sourwood, eastern hophornbeam."
