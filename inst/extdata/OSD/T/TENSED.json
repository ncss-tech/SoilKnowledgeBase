The Fastjet soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact (volcanic rock). The Luckycreek soils are dry for 75 to 100 consecutive days. Pagecreek soils have horizons with secondary carbonates. Pinney soils formed in lacustrine deposits without loess. Powellbutte, Runyon and Tommycork soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact (volcanic rock)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tensed soils are on dissected terraces and foothills at elevations of 2,500 to 3,200 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived from metasedimentary rocks of the Belt series with a mixture of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part of the profile.  The average annual precipitation is 23 to 27 inches, including 4 to 5 feet of snowfall. The average annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F. The frost free period is 90 to 130 days."
