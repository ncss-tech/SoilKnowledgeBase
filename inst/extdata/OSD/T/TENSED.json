  "OVERVIEW": "The Tensed series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium or tertiary alluvium from metasedimentary rocks and mixed with loess and an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Tensed soils are on dissected terraces and foothills. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
