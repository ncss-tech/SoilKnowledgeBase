    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature is 35 to 43 degrees F., and the average summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist when not frozen.  The profile is noncalcareous to 60 inches or deeper.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick.  The A1 horizon to a depth of 7 inches or more has value of 3.5 to 4.5 dry and j1.5 to 2.5 moist, and chroma of 1.5 to 2.5.  It has weak platy to strong granular structure and is medium acid to neutral (pH 6.0 to 7.0).  Its organic matter has a C:N ratio of less than 13.5.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 6.5 dry and 3.5 to 4.5 moist, and chroma of 2.5 through 4.   It is light clay loam to silty clay loam containing 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has moderate to weak, very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid (pH 5.5 to 6.1)."

Blaine, Buena Vista, Hoodle, and Nathrop soils have Cca horizons, also Buena Vista and Nathrop soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Ess soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the B2t horizon, and lack common uncoated silt particles in the upper part of the B2t horizon.  Libeg soils have mollic epipedons thinner than 8 inches.  Thiel soils have mildly alkaline B2t horizons and have a Cca horizon.  Woodhall soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tahquats soils are on alluvial fans and footslopes at elevation of 5,500 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes range form 2 to 20 percent.   The alluvium and colluvium are derived mostly from quartzite and some sandstone materials.  The climate is continental subhumid and has an average annual precipitation of 15 to 25 inches, including 5 to 10 feet of snowfall, and an average freeze-free period of 30 to 100 days."
