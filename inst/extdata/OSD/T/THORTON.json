  "OVERVIEW": "The Thorton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and glacial drift over glacial drift on debris aprons, valley walls, and bedrock benches.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
