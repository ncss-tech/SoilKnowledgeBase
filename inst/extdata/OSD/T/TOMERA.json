  "OVERVIEW": "The Tomera series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed, but dominantly sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic materials.  Tomera soils are on dissected terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
