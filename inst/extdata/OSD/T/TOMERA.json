  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tomera soils are on dissected terraces and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed but dominantly sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic materials.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,460 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C., and the frost free season is 100 to 120 days."
