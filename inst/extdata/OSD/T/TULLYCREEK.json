These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from fluvial deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C (44 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F); and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F).

Ultisol feature - base saturation of less than 35 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon\n4. Humult feature  greater than 22 kilograms per square meter of organic carbon to a depth of 1 meter\n5. Palehumult features - Clay remains at least 85 percent of its maximum to a depth of 200 centimeters\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 75 centimeters, averages 45 percent clay, by weight, and 3 percent gravel and 8 percent paragravel, by volume.\nSoil classified using the 11th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNSSL pedon number:  05N0638 clay percentages were re-calculated due to poor dispersion and used for series range.
