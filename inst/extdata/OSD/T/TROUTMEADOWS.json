The soil is formed in volcanic ash overlying residuum and colluvium derived from basalt.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 25 to 70 days."
