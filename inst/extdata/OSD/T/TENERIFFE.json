Colton, Masardis, Stetson and Waiska soils are stratified in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  In addition, Colton, Guardlake, Hermon, Masardis, Sheepscot, Stetson, and Waiska soils lack a volcanic ash mantle and are in a climate with cold winters and moist warm summers.  Etach and Marblemount soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.   Limking and Skykomish soils have a xeric moisture regime."

The Teneriffe soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over residuum and colluvium from granitic and low grade metamorphic rocks.  The climate is marine influenced with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 90 to 130 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."
