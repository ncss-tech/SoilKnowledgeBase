  "OVERVIEW": "The Teneriffe series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over colluvium from granitic and low grade metamorphic rocks. Teneriffe soils are on colluvial sideslopes at elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 110 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Colton, Masardis, Stetson and Waiska soils are stratified in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  In addition, Colton, Guardlake, Hermon, Masardis, Sheepscot, Stetson, and Waiska soils lack a volcanic ash mantle and are in a climate with cold winters and moist warm summers.  Etach and Marblemount soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.   Limking and Skykomish soils have a xeric moisture regime."
