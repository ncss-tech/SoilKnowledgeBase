  "OVERVIEW": "The Twist series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations.  Twist soils are on fan remnant, and stream terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
