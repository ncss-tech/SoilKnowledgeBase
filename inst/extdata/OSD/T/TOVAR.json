They formed in residuum, alluvium and colluvium from tuff, volcanic breccia, limestone and sandstone.  The climate is semiarid with precipitation ranging from 14 to 18 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 73 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
