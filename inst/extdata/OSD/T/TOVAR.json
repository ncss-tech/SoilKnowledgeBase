  "OVERVIEW": "The Tovar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, alluvium and colluvium from tuff, volcanic breccia and sandstone.  Tovar soils are on hills, plateaus, structural benches and have slopes that range from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
