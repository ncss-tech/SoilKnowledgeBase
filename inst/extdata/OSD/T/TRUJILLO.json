  "OVERVIEW": "The Trujillo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from coarse sandstone.  Trujillo soils are on hills, drainageways, and fans.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
