The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 20 percent clay, more than 30 percent coarser than fine sand, and has 50 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam averaging 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel and 20 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, or extremely cobbly sandy loam averaging 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 20 to 30 percent gravel and 30 to 50 percent cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 120 to 160 inches.   The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."
