  "OVERVIEW": "The Tulecan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Tulecan soils are on mountain slopes and hills. Slopes are l5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
