  "OVERVIEW": "The Tonalea series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils on dunes of hills and plateaus.  These soils formed in eolian deposits derived dominantly from sandstone.  Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
