Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Elevations are 5600 to 6800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days.  Precipitation falls as intense summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain or snow."

Kydestea soils contain greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and hard sandstone at less than 20 inches.  Mido soils are 40 inches or more deep.  Travessilla soils are shallow to hard, fractured sandstone on mesa edges.  Zyme soils are fine-textured and shallow to soft shale."
