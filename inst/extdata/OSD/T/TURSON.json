  "OVERVIEW": "The Turson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on flood-plains and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to about 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F.",
