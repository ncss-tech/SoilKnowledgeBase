  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nTalala soils are on summits of hills created as a result of strip mining operations.  Reclamation operations resulted in landforms similar to pre-mining contours.  Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent.  The soils were excavated and replaced with loamy material weathered from sandstone, shale, and limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1320 mm (38 to 52 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F).  Frost-free period is 200 to 240 days.  Elevation is 152 to 305 meters (500 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indces is greater than 64."

Bates, Claremore, Collinsville, Coweta, Dennis, Endsaw, Eram, Hector, Okemah, Parsons, and Summit soils have not been mined and do not have an excavated and replaced solum and substratum.  Bates, Claremore, Dennis, Okemah, Parsons, and Summit soils have argillic horizons and mollic epipedons.  Endsaw and Eram soils have argillic horizons.  Coweta and Collinsville soils are shallow to undisturbed sandstone and have mollic epipedons.  Brazilton soils have had the subsoil replaced, are fine textured, lack fragments or pararock fragments, and are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep over replaced shale overburden.  Foyil soils are fine textured, have a Cd horizon, and are moderately deep over the dense, replaced substratum.  Kanima soils are loamy skeletal and do not have a replaced topsoil with mollic colors."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils are the result of post-1977 strip mine reclamation.  The landscape was returned to its original elevation and contour, and topsoil was returned to the site.  The substratum is a mixture of shale, limestone, and sandstone overburden moved during mining.  The topsoil was stripped and replaced on-site or on adjacent mined sites.  Constructed drainage channels and rectangular or linear ponds are characteristic of reclaimed areas.\nDiagnostic horizon and features in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches)\nochric epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) - This horizon is composed of former mollic epipedons from the original soils.  It meets the color and organic carbon requirement for the mollic epipedon, but is hard and massive when dry.\nDensic contact: 28 cm (11 inches) - dense, root restricting earthy material mixed with limestone and sandstone rock fragments.  Base saturation is more than 35 percent.\nUdic moisture regime: moisture control section is dry in some part less than 90 days per year\nTaxonomic version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
