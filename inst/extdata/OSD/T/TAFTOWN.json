  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 44 to 72 inches thick and is the same as the depth to bedrock.  Loess thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 12 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam or silt loam.  It ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid in the upper part but the lower part is medium acid or strongly acid.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe 2Cr horizon is interbedded neutral shale and sandstone.  Shale is the dominant strata but proportion of shale and sandstone depends on hillside position."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Taftown soils are on side slopes in dissected uplands. Slopes range from 12 to 25 percent.  This soil formed in 24 to 40 inches of loess and the underlying residuum from shale and sandstone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alford, Gudgel, and Hosmer soils.  Alford soils formed in more than 60 inches of loess and are dominantly on less sloping ridge tops and side slopes.  Gudgel and Hosmer soils have fragipans and are on less sloping ridgetops and upper side slopes."
