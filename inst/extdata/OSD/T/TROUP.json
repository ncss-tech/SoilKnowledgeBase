  "OVERVIEW": "The Troup series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in unconsolidated sandy and loamy marine sediments. Troup soils are on ridges and hillslopes.  Slopes predominantly range from 0 to 15 percent but range to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (64 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1320 millimeters (52 inches).",
