The top of the argillic horizon is within 24 inches of the surface and this horizon contains more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 56 degrees F.  Average summer soil temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 90 days in the summer.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly silty clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly loam, very cobbly clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, extremely cobbly loam, extremely stony loam, extremely stony silt loam, or extremely stony clay loam.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is 7.4 to 9.0.  The lower part of this horizon is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tannahill soils are on steep south- and west-facing canyon slopes and have gradients of 7 to 90 percent.  They formed in residuum from fine grained igneous rocks, mainly basalt with some loess in the upper layers.  Elevations are 1,200 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Average annual precipitation is typically 12 to 16 inches with most of it coming as rainfall.  In northeastern Oregon, the average annual precipitation ranges to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is 34 degrees F.; average July temperature is 74 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 180 days."
