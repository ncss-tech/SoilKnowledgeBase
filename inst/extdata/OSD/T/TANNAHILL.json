  "STATES": "ID,OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tannahill series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from fine grained igneous rocks, mainly basalt, with some loess in the surface horizons.  Tannahill soils are on south and west facing canyon slopes and have gradients of 7 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

They formed in residuum from fine grained igneous rocks, mainly basalt with some loess in the upper layers.  Elevations are 1,200 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Average annual precipitation is typically 12 to 16 inches with most of it coming as rainfall.  In northeastern Oregon, the average annual precipitation ranges to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is 34 degrees F.; average July temperature is 74 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 180 days."
