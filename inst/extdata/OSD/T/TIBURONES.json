Reaction is medium acid to extremely acid in the upper part and slightly acid to neutral in the lower part.  They are friable, slightly sticky and plastic throughout.  Fiber content is less than 5 percent throughout.  Soluble salts may or may not be present.\nThe Oap horizon is black (N 2/0).  Structure ranges from weak to moderate granular.\nThe Oa2 horizon ranges from weak coarse to moderate coarse prismatic.  Roots vary from common fine to medium.\nThe lower part of the Oa horizon ranges to hue of 10YR, with value of 2 and chroma of 2 or less."

The Palmas Altas soils are slightly acid to neutral throughout.  The Garrochales soils have a limnic layer within the control section that is 5 cm. or more thick.  The Saladar soils have hemic materials in the bottom tier."
