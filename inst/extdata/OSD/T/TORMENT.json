  "OVERVIEW": "The Torment series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvial sands from meandering rivers.  Torment soils are on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on river valley bottom floodplains.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
