The soil is very strongly to strongly acid in the upper sequence of horizons unless limed and extremely acid through slightly acid in the lower sequence of horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon in some pedons contains coarse bodies of uncoated white (10YR 8/1, 8/2) sand.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E' horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe 2Bhb horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  (This section not revised)  Series in the same family are Baymeade, Chipola, Chisolm, Coosaw, Garcon, Gomery, Kenansville, Tenaha, and Uchee.  Similar series are Blaney, Centenary, Dragston, Echaw, Olanta, Onslow, Pactolus, Rumford, Seagate, Stallings, and Witherbee.  None of these soils have argillic horizon that overlie spodic horizons.  Baymeade and Onslow soils have intermittent B bodies within the E horizon and Baymeade soils have better drainage.  Chipola, Chisolm, Coosaw, Garcon, Gomery, Tenaha, and Uchee soils also lack a spodic horizon.  Blaney soils have slightly cemented, brittle B horizons.  Centenary, Echaw, Pactolus, and Wetherbee soils lack argillic horizons.  Dragston, Olanta, Onslow, Rumford, and Stallings soils lack arenic surfaces.  Kenansville soils have better drainage.  Seagate soils have light gray E horizons and Bh horizons that overlie argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tomahawk soils occur on nearly level interstream divides on the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in marine and/or eolian sandy and loamy deposits.  The climate is warm and humid.  The average annual rainfall is about 48 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. near the type location."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to competing series, these include the Kureb, Lakeland, Leon, Lynn Haven, and Murville series.  None of these soils have an argillic horizon. In addition, Kureb and Lakeland soils are considerably sandier and occupy the higher parts of the landscape.  Leon, Lynn Haven, and Murville soils are wetter, and do not have argillic horizons.  They are on the low parts of the landscape."

Natural vegetation consists of longleaf pine, loblolly pine, willow oak, water oak, turkey oak, blue jack oak, and sweetgum.  Understory plants consist of gallberry, huckleberry, southern wax myrtle, common sassafras, and pineland threeawn."
