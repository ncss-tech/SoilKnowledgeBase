  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuckerville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and sandstone.  Tuckerville soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
