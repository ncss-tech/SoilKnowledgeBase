  "OVERVIEW": "The Tabyago series consists of moderately deep to interbedded sandstone and shale, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Tabyago soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
