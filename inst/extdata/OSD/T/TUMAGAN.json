The presence of sulfidic material within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for acid sulfate drainage if they are dredged and exposed to the air.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nPeraquic feature - Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (Under 73 inches (185 centimeters) of salt water)\nSulfidic materials - within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface (the A, Cg, and Oa horizons).\nMLRA = 153D\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nBalduff, D.M., 2007.
