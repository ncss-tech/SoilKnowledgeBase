  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunawee series consists of  shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rock.  Tunawee soils are on mountain slopes and plateaus with slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches and the mean annual  temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
