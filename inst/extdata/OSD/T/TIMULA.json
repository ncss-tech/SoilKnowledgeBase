The mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.7 to 12.2 degrees C (44 to 54 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1070 mm (29 to 42 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 152 to 415 meters (500 to 1360 feet) above mean sea level."

Seaton soils are on slightly higher elevations on similar slopes and on rounded ridge tops and have sola more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick. The Chute soils are sandy and are on similar landscapes. The Fayette and Mt. Carroll soils have argillic horizons and are on similar landscape positions, but also are on rounded and gently sloping ridgetops."
