The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches and includes the Bw horizon. The depth to the calcic horizon is 15 to 24 inches. The particle-size control section averages more than 18 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is gravelly loam with 10 to 20 percent clay. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel. Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is loam or silt loam with 15 to 35 percent gravel and 18 to 27 percent clay. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 10 percent.
