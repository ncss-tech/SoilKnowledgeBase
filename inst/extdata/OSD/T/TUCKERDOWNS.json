  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuckerdowns series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terraces. They formed in alluvium and are influenced by loess in the surface layers. Slope is 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages more than 18 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is gravelly loam with 10 to 20 percent clay. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel. Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is loam or silt loam with 15 to 35 percent gravel and 18 to 27 percent clay. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 10 percent.
