  "OVERVIEW": "The Timakwa series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in woody and herbaceous organic materials over sandy deposits in depressions on lake plains, outwash plains, till plains, moraines, and flood plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic layers and high or very high in the sandy material. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 1258 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The organic material extends to a depth of 40 to 130 cm. The reaction of the organic material commonly is ultra acid to moderately acid in 0.01 M calcium chloride but the range includes slightly acid or neutral in some places. The pH value is 4.5 or more (in 0.01 M calcium chloride) in one or more layers of organic soil materials within the control section. The reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Woody fragments, consisting of twigs, branches, logs, or stumps, occur in some part of the organic soil materials in most pedons and range from 0 to 30 percent by volume in the control section. Fragments range in size from 20 to 300 mm in diameter.\nThe surface tier has hue of 10YR to 5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 6. It is dominantly muck (sapric material); however, some pedons have surface layers of peat or muck peat (fibric or hemic materials). The structure of the surface tier is massive, or is weak or medium, coarse to fine granular or subangular blocky.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers have hue of 10YR to 5YR, or are neutral; value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 4. They are typically muck (sapric material). Thin hemic layers less than 3 inches thick occur in some places on the boundary between MLRAs 144A and 101. The tiers are commonly massive, but some pedons have weak coarse blocky or thick platy structure.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 8. It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or gravelly analogues of these textures. Some pedons may have thin lenses of loamy very fine sand within the control section; however the weighted average in the control section is coarser than loamy very fine sand. Rock fragments range in size from gravel to stones and from 0 to 40 percent by volume."

Poorly drained Ridgebury and Leicester or very poorly drained Whitman soils occur at the margins of Timakwa areas as they grade into the upland. Very poorly drained Scarboro soils are sandy."
