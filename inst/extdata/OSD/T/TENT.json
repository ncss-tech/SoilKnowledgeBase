Some pedons have an Ab and Oe horizon below 65 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 inches\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 28 inches\nAquic condition-the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously or periodically saturated\nSeries Control Section: 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: The type location pedon was sampled as S93DE-003-010.  Additional reference samples are S92DE-003-017, S95DE-003-005, and S95DE-003-007.\nDATA MAPUNIT ID: To be developed\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
