  "OVERVIEW": "The Troughspring series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Troughspring soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
