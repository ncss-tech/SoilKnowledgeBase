  "REVDATE": "09/2004",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tick series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly slope alluvium and the underlying dense, clayey mudstone. These soils are on gently sloping to very steep upland ridges.  Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
