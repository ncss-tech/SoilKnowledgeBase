  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Triumph soils are on valley walls and ridges at elevations of 1,200 to 2,200 meters.  These soils are found on the ridge-shoulder-steep valley wall continuum with slopes ranging from 0 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed with residuum and colluvium from granitic and metasedimentary rock.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C.  Frost free season is 30 to 60 days."

Harlequin soils are shallow to bedrock and are found on valley walls with slopes steeper than 65 percent.  Stetattle soils have andic soil properties, and are also found on active, herbaceous portions of valley walls.  Treen soils are shallow to bedrock, have andic soil properties, and are found on ridges that have preserved volcanic ash deposits."
