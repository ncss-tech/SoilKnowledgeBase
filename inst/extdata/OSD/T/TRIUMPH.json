  "OVERVIEW": "The Triumph series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed with colluvium and residuum from granitic and metasedimentary rock on valley walls and ridges.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent on valley walls and 0 to 10 percent on ridges.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

These soils are found on the ridge-shoulder-steep valley wall continuum with slopes ranging from 0 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed with residuum and colluvium from granitic and metasedimentary rock.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C.  Frost free season is 30 to 60 days."

Treen soils are shallow to bedrock, have andic soil properties, and are found on ridges that have preserved volcanic ash deposits."
