  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches or more.  Exchangeable sodium percentage increases with depth and exceeds 15 percent at a depth that ranges from 28 to 40 inches, and within a depth of 16 inches below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon has from 18 to 27 percent clay.  Brown and black stains or concretions or both commonly are few to many in all horizon below the Ap horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid except for surface layers that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4, with or without brownish mottles.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon commonly is mottled in shades of gray and brown.  In some pedons, it has a matrix in hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4; and mottles in shades of brown or gray are few to many.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon commonly is mottled in shades of brown and gray.  Less commonly it has a brownish matrix with mottles in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam.  Seams of gray silty material between peds are as much as 10 percent of the volume in some pedons.\nThe Btnc/E horizon is mottled in shades of brown and gray; the brownish portion has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8; the grayish portion has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Structure is weak or moderate medium or coarse prismatic, and the consistence is firm or very firm in place, but when disturbed the prisms part with moderate pressure to weak or moderate medium subangular blocky.  The E part is discontinuous gray silt coatings or interfingers between the faces of the prisms, with more on the vertical than the horizontal.  These gray silt coats commonly make up less than 15 percent of the matrix.  Texture of the B part is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btnc horizon is mottled in shades of brown and gray; the brownish portion has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8; the grayish portion has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Black and brown concretions and stains commonly are few to many.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

Closely related series include the Bonn, Bude, Deerford, Egypt, Foley, Hilleman, Lafe, McCrory, Peoria, Pheba, Rosella, Stuttgart, Tippo, and Wanilla soils.  The Bonn, Deerford, Foley, Hilleman, McCrory, Peoria, and Rosella soils have an aquic moisture regime.  In addition, Bonn, Deerford, Foley, Hilleman, and Peoria are fine-silty in the particle-size control section.  Bude, Egypt, Pheba, Tippo, and Wanilla soils do not have a natric horizon.  In addition, Bude and Egypt are fine-silty in the particle-size control section, and Pheba, Tippo, and Wanilla are coarse-silty in the particle-size control section.  Lafe soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section and have mixed mineralogy.  Stuttgart soils are fine in the particle-size control section and have montmorillonitic mineralogy."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Talla soils are on nearly level, on broad, old stream terraces and uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in loamy, fluvial sediments that are underlain by older, contrasting geologic formations.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees Fahrenheit and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches."

Bude, Mantachie, Marietta, Ora, Pheba, Prentiss, and Providence soils do not have a natric horizon.  Also, Bude soils are fine-silty in the control section and have a fragipan; Mantachie soils do not have a diagnostic horizon; Marietta soils have a cambic horizon and are medium acid to mildly alkaline; Ora, Pheba, Prentiss, and Providence soils have a fragipan.  The somewhat poorly drained Bude soils are in similar positions as the Talla soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils and the moderately well drained Marietta soils are on flood plains.  The moderately well drained Ora, Prentiss, and Providence are on slightly higher parts of the terrain on terraces and uplands.  The somewhat poorly drained Pheba soils are in similar positions as the Talla soils."
