  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Tizzard soils were formerly included with miscellaneous areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support submersed aquatic vegetation.  These soils would classify in the proposed \"Subaquic Sulfic\" subgroup.  Refer to \"Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland;\" G.P. Demas, J.H. Brown, and M.C. Rabenhorst; July 1998.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (oxidized)--the zone from 0 to 1 inches (A horizon)\nPeraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 60 inches is permanently saturated\nSulfidic feature--The zone from 31 to 36 inches contains sulfidic materials (verified by moist incubation)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData Map Unit ID: To be developed\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
