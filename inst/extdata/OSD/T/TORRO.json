  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Torro soils are on south-facing mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from chert and shale with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,980 to 2,500 meters.  The climate is cool, continental with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 80 days."
