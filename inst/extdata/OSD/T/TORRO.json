  "OVERVIEW": "The Torro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from cherts and shales with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  The Torro soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
