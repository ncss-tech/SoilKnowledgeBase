  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunnelcreek series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
