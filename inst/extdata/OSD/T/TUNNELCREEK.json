These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 days in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and 8 to 18 percent clay.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 70 to 90 percent throughout the profile.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 1 to 2 percent throughout the A and Bw horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR dry and moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.  Moist bulk density is 0.50 to 0.90 g/cc.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR dry and moist, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter.  Moist bulk density is 0.80 to 1.20 g/cc.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR dry and moist, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry and moist.
