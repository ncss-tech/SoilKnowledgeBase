Non-Forested areas may include but are not limited to various species of cordgrass (Spartina spp.), needlegrass rush (Juncus roemerianus), salt grass (Distichlis spicata), Jamaica swamp sawgrass (Cladium mariscus ssp. Jamaicense), and various flowering forbs. Scattered stunted mangrove species (mentioned above) may be present in non-forested communities. Changes in salinity (ppt) is often the main driver between different major zones of vegetative species in both forested and non-forested areas."
