  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium and residuum from sandstone from the Swauk formation.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F; the mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F; and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is about 100 to 140 days and the average frost-free season is about 60 to 90 days."
