  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 40 to 55 percent.  Base saturation at the paralithic contact ranges from 60 to 90 percent.\nThe A horizon has colors in shades of red or brown in hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam or gravelly phases with these textures.  Glauconitic ironstone or ironstone pebbles and fragments make up 2 to 35 percent.  Reaction raanges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has colors in shades of red or brown in hue of 10R to 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have weathered glaconitic materials in the lower part that have colors in shades of yellow or brown.  The texture is clay loam or clay.  Pebbles and ironstone fragments range from few to 35 percent in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BCt horizon has colors in shades of red and brown in hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of yellow or brown range from few to common.  Weathered glauconitic materials make up 5 to 60 percent of most horizons.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a C horizon that has 80 percent or more weathered glaconitic materials, ironstone and glaconitic marl, and/or glaconitic greensand.  The texture of these materials is clay loam or clay.\nThe Cr horizon consists of glauconite materials, glaconitic marl, greensand marl with intermittent layers of glauconitic ironstone.  These materials are commonly interbedded and weakly cemneted."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bronaugh and Bub series and the similar Alto, Nacogdoches, Redsprings, and Ulto series.  Bronaugh soils are more silty and have a solum more that 40 inches thick.  Alto and Nacogdoches soils have a solum thicker than 60 inches.  Bub soils have a solum less than 20 inches thisk.  Redsprings soils do not have a paralithic contact with glauconitic materials.  Ulto soils are member of the ultic subgroup."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trawick soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands.  They formed mainly in the Weches geologic formation which is rich in glauconite.  Slope gradients are predominately 4 to 20 percent but range from 1 to 45 percent.  Annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 235 to 250.  The elevation ranges from 350 to 650 above sea level.   Thornthwaite P-E indices ranges from 68 to 84."

Alto soils are in lower concave areas.  Briley, Darco and Lilbert soils are on higher postions and have thick sandy epipedons.  Bub soils are in similar positions.  Elrose soils are on lower positions, have smoother slopes and have fine-loamy control sections.  Kirvin soils are on nearby less sloping smooth convex areas, and are Ultisols.  Nacogdoches soils are on adjoining smoother less sloping areas."
