Tetlin soils are on bedrock cored hills and are assumed to have residuum or bedrock within the permafrost in the lower part of the series control section."

Disturbance to the organic mat by wildfire or clearing results in warming, lowering of the permafrost table, and subsequent lowering of the water table."
