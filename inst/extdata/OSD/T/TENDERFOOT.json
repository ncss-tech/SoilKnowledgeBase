  "REVDATE": "08/2007",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenderfoot series consists of shallow to hardpan, well drained soils on plateaus and mesas.  These soils formed in alluvium from cherty limestone. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
