  "OVERVIEW": "The Toebranch series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
