  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is greater than 50 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Reaction in each horizon ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid except that the Ap horizon is less acid when limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon and E part of E/Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  This horizon has mottles of chroma of 2 or less within 10 inches of its upper boundary.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4 with mottles in shades gray and brown.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Much of the clay in the Btx horizon is concentrated in the gray seams.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is variable, ranging from silt loam to clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Taft is the only series in this family. Soils in similar families are the Dickson, Guthrie, Leadvale, and Sango series.  Dickson soils lack gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the B horizon, and are better drained than Taft soils.  Guthrie soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less between the base of the Ap horizons and the fragipans.  Leadvale soils lack gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the B horizons and have argillic horizons above the fragipan.  Sango soils lack gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the B horizon and are better drained than Taft soils.  Sango soils also have less than 18 percent clay in the B horizon above the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Taft soils are on upland flats, stream terraces, and in depressions.  These soils formed in a silty mantle of loess or alluvium and the underlying residuum of limestone or shale.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Near the type location, average annual temperature is about 59 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 50 inches."
