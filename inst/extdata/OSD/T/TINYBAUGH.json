  "OVERVIEW": "The Tinybaugh series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from granite over residuum weathered from granite. The Tinybaugh soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1070 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
