  "REVDATE": "09/2003",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Topknot series are shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till. Bedrock is at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. They are nearly level and gently sloping soils on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 34 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of Fe/Mn oxides and Fe depletions occur within 20 inches of the soil surface. Rock fragments consisting mainly of sandstone and granite range from 5 to 30 percent by volume throughout. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral (but one subhorizon has a pH greater than 5.5).\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Some pedons have an Ap horizon up to 10 inches thick, with value of 3 or 4 (6 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has faint or distinct redoximorphic concentrations and depletions in the lower part. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or weak platy. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has faint or distinct redox concentrations and depletions. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Ensign, Ruse, Torull and Tuller series are in related families. Ensign and Ruse soils are dominated by rock fragments derived from limestone. In addition Ensign soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the solum. Both Torull and Tuller soils are more acid, and Tuller soils also have a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Topknot soils are nearly level and gently sloping soils on till uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. They are in slight depressions and in areas between sandstone bedrock ridges. The till parent material is derived mainly from sandstone and granite, but also includes other sedimentary rock such as dolostone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F; and mean frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 1800 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chazy, Irona, Lyonmounten, Peasleeville, Schroon, and Sunapee soils. The well drained Irona soils are in a drainage sequence. The Chazy soils are on similar landscapes, but are 20 to 40 inches to sandstone bedrock. The Peasleeville and Lyonmounten soils are also on similar landscapes but are very deep to bedrock. Moderately well drained Schroon and Sunapee soils occur on more convex landscape positions and are very deep to bedrock."
