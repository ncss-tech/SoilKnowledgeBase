  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 59 F. to 60 F., the soil temperature is not below 47 F., and the average winter soil temperature is about 53 F. The soils are saturated in most winters within 6 to 24 inches of the surface. By late summer the soils are dry to a depth of 5 feet or more. Soil between the depths of 12 and 35 inches usually is moist by early December and stays moist in some or all parts until May or June and is continuously dry the rest of the year. Textures throughout are sand or loamy sand. The A1 horizon is gray to light brownish gray (10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/1, and 6/2) and neutral to medium acid. The A2 horizon is white to light gray (10YR 8/2, 8/1, 8/3, 7/1, 7/2, and 7/3) and moist chroma is 2 or 3. It is slightly to strongly acid. Reddish brown shot or bodies or concretions 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter make up 1/4 to 4 percent of this horizon. The Bcs horizon has the same color range as the A2 horizon, but on the average has about 1/2 unit stronger chroma. In some pedons, it has mottles with chroma of 3 through 6. Concretions make up 15 to 30 percent of the volume of the Bcs horizon. Most concretions are round, although some are joined into irregular lumps and in a few pedons the concretions are very numerous and form an imperfectly cemented pan. They are very hard to indurated and seem to be sand grains cemented by clay and possibly silica and colored by iron. They do not slake in water. There are 1 to 5 percent soft to firm bodies. Most of the Bcs horizons are medium, strongly or very strongly acid, but the range includes slightly acid. The C horizon is light yellowish brown to light gray or white. Concretions or brownish soft bodies make up less than 2 percent of the mass. At a depth of about 5 to 10 feet the sandy soil material is underlain by shale or dense fine material that is slowly or very slowly permeable."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE: These are the Arnold, Baywood, Carlsbad, Corralitos and Narlon series. Arnold and Corralitos soils lack concretions and seasonal saturation. Baywood soils have a mollic epipedon. Carlsbad soils have a duripan. Narlon soils have a clay argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING: Tangair soils are nearly level to gently sloping. They are on terraces at elevations of 40 to 900 feet. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with cool rainless but foggy summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is about 53 F.; average July temperature is about 59 F.; mean annual temperature is about 55 F. The average freeze-free season is about 300 days."

Soil permeability is rapid or very rapid, but underlying materials have slow or very slow permeability."
