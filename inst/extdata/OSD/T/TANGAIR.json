  "OVERVIEW": "The Tangair series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand and sandy marine terrace deposits. Tangair soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 390 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
