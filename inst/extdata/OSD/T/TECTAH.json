  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tectah soils occur on broad ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Elevations are 24 to 702 meters (75 to 2300 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone and metasedimentary rocks. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days."

Ahpah soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a lithic contact and lack an argillic horizon. Trailhead soils have parasesquic mineralogy and hues redder than 7.5YR throughout the argillic horizon. The Ahpah soils are on convex slopes and on narrow ridge crests above the Tectah soils. The Coppercreek soils are on concave areas and on steeper slopes below the Tectah soils. The Trailhead soils are on broad, gentler slopes above the Tectah soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (Oi& A horizons)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 30 to 185 centimeters (BAt, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 & Bt4 horizons)\n3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of less than 15 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon\n4. Humult feature - 15.7 kilograms per square meter of organic carbon to a depth of 1 meter\n5. Palehumults feature - Clay remains at least 89 percent of its maximum to a depth of 185 centimeters\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 30 to 80 centimeters, averages 39 percent clay, by weight, and 6 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.32, and DTA iron oxide 4 percent. Since associated soils have about two thirds as much gibbsite as iron oxide, gibbsite is estimated as approximately 3 percent. The sum of DTA iron oxide plus gibbsite is assumed to be less than 10 percent.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil profile sample 82-CA-12-04X was collected at the type location and analyzed at the University of California Soil Morphology Laboratory in Davis, California. Back-up sample 84-RNP-3 was collected at another Tectah profile in Redwood National Park. Sample 57-CA-08-02X was collected from a Tectah profile in Del Norte County and is described on pages 21-22 in Begg, et al (1984).\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
