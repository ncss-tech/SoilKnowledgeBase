Tolicha soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and in a small amount of loess high in volcanic ash. Mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C. The freeze-free period is about 130 to 150 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Tolicha soils were classified as Lithosols in the 1938 Yearbook Classification.\nThe pedon and the concept should be field checked during the update to verify if cambic horizons, calcic horizons or C horizons exist and adjust the classification if needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and Bw horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 8 to 30 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 30 cm (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the surface to 30 cm (A, Bw1 and Bw3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
