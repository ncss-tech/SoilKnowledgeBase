  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tolicha series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and a small amount of loess high in volcanic ash. Tolicha soils are on hills. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
