  "OVERVIEW": "The Teabrush series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from calcareous sandstone and shale.  Teabrush soils are on alluvial flats and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
