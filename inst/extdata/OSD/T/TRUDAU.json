  "REVDATE": "09/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Trudau series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, flood-plain steps, drainageways and knolls.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
