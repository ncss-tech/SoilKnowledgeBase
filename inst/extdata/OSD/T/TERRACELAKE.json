  "OVERVIEW": "The Terracelake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over or mixed with colluvium and residuum from volcanic rock. Terracelake soils are on glaciated volcanic domes, glaciated mountain slopes, glaciated lava flows, scoured glacial-valley walls and floors, and roche moutenees in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 95 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 99 inches (2515 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5 degrees C).",
