  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in this soil are normally less than 5 percent, but range from 0 to 10 percent in all horizons.  It ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid except the horizons near bedrock ranges to mildly alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Eroded areas also have hue of 5YR and chroma of 6.  Pedons with value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is silt loam, except eroded and severely eroded areas include silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nIn some pedons, the A and E horizons formed in cherty colluvium and have a texture of gravelly loam or gravelly silt loam.  There are other pedons where the A and E horizons formed in loamy colluvium from sandstone and the texture is loam.  These pedons have a discontinuity between the colluvium and the clayey Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the Bt horizon also has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles range from none to common in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  Texture is silty clay or clay, except the upper few inches is silty clay loam in some pedons.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles range from few to many in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  In some pedons, it is mottled without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is silty clay or clay."

Archer soils have sandy A horizons.  Barfield soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Bradyville, Braxton, Capshaw, Colbert, Collegedale, Hampshire, Mimosa, and Winnsboro are all more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  In addition, Capshaw, Colbert, and Hampshire soils have B horizons with hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Carbo and Conasauga soils have a B horizon with hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  In addition, Carbo soils have a B horizon with more than 60 percent clay."
