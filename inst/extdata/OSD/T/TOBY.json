  "OVERVIEW": "The Toby series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium or eolian deposits.  These soils are on fans, terraces, hills and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 13 inches.",

Kremlin soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic epipedon.  They are on toe slopes. Rhame soils are moderately deep to bedded sandstone and less than 30 inches to carbonates and the base of the cambic horizon.  The Rhame soils are on higher slopes than the Toby soils.  Zeona soils are sandy.  They are on ridges, hummocks and dunes."
