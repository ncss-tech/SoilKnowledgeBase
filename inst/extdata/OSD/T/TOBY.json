Fleak soils are shallow to soft sandstone and are on side slopes and ridges higher in the landscape.  Havre soils are fine-loamy and are on adjacent flood plains and lower terraces.  Kremlin soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic epipedon.  They are on toe slopes. Rhame soils are moderately deep to bedded sandstone and less than 30 inches to carbonates and the base of the cambic horizon.  The Rhame soils are on higher slopes than the Toby soils.  Zeona soils are sandy.  They are on ridges, hummocks and dunes."
