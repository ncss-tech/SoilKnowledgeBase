  "OVERVIEW": "The Tefton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Tefton soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps and valley floors and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
