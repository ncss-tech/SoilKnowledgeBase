Depth to the cemented sand and gravel is 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are noncalcareous. Depth to the base of the B2t is 10 to 20 inches. The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral. The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.; value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It is sandy clay loam, averaging between 20 and 26 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser . Gravel is very fine and ranges from 10 to 20 percent. It is neutral or mildly alkaline."
