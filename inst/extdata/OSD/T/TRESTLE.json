  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Trestle series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium over outwash or valley fill materials. They are nearly level to gently sloping soils along high gradient streams and in fan positions. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments, ranging from pebbles to flagstone size, are 5 to 25 percent of the volume of the A horizon, 15 to 45 percent of the B horizon, and 40 to 70 percent of the substratum. The reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon unless limed and moderately acid to slightly acid below.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak to strong, fine or medium granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is very weak to moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 4. Texture is coarse sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is loose or very friable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

The Beanblossom soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Barbour, Chenango, Hamlin, Howard, Occum, Tioga, Tunkhannock and Wappinger series are similar soils in related families. Barbour soils average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. The Chenango and Tunkhannock soils are not subject to flooding. Hamlin soils have coarse-silty, particle-size control sections. Howard soils have an argillic horizon. Occum and Tioga soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and Wappinger soils have coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections."
