  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments, ranging from pebbles to flagstone size, are 5 to 25 percent of the volume of the A horizon, 15 to 45 percent of the B horizon, and 40 to 70 percent of the substratum. The reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon unless limed and moderately acid to slightly acid below.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak to strong, fine or medium granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is very weak to moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 4. Texture is coarse sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is loose or very friable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

The Beanblossom soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Barbour, Chenango, Hamlin, Howard, Occum, Tioga, Tunkhannock and Wappinger series are similar soils in related families. Barbour soils average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. The Chenango and Tunkhannock soils are not subject to flooding. Hamlin soils have coarse-silty, particle-size control sections. Howard soils have an argillic horizon. Occum and Tioga soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and Wappinger soils have coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in stratified alluvium over outwash or valley fill deposits. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation, from 33 to 45 inches; mean growing season, from 120 to 180 days."

Chenango, Tunkhannock, and related soils formed in outwash are on nearby higher terraces. Deposit soils are on similar landscapes in slightly lower positions. Valois, Maplecrest, Bath, Lackawanna, Lordstown and their related soils are on adjoining uplands."

Fluventic subgroup - organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth or is 0.2 percent or more at a depth of at least 50\ninches below the soil surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
