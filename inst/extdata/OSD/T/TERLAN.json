  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time in the moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F unless irrigated.  Depth to the duripan is 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches and may or many not include any or all of the Bt horizon.  The particle-size control section contains 18 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The rock fragments are mostly rounded basalt fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt or Btk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam, with 15 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkq or Bk horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry, chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.   It is gravelly loam, gravely silt loam, very gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.  It averages 15 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."

Aned soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon and are noncalcareous.  Mudco and Oxendine soils are noncalcareous in the lower part of the B horizon and in the duripan.  Roval soils have an A horizon 1 to 3 inches thick.  Bluemass soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Terlan soils are on dissected flat summit, fan terraces, and fan remnants which grade from mountain footslopes to basin drainageways and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  They formed in alluvium mixed with loess over a gravelly duripan overlying the Ellensburg formation.  Elevation is 1,600 to 2,600 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

Selah soils on old alluvial fans are 20 to 40 inches to indurated duripan.  Rollinger soils on north-facing toeslopes, hillslopes and piedmont slopes are fine loamy and are greater than 40 inches deep.  Wipple soils on footslopes are clayey-skeletal and are deep."
