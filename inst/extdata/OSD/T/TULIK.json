  "OVERVIEW": "The Tulik series consists of deep, well-drained soils formed in layers of fine-grained and coarse-grained volcanic ash, with a few layers of cinders. Tulik soils are on alluvial fans and uplands and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 65 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from to 40 to 44 degrees F.  The soil is always moist.  It consists of layered silty and sandy volcanic ash, with silty materials predominating.  An admixture or thin layers of cinders may occur.  Below depths of 20 inches, coarse, medium, and fine sand-size volcanic ash commonly makes up 20 to 30 percent of the soil mass.  There is considerable variation in texture, arrangement, and thickness of the layers.  Colors throughout the profile have hues of 5YR to 10YR with values of 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 1 or 2 moist.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Island series of the same family, and the Aslik, Kvichak, Pustoi, and Umnak series.  The Island soils have no layers of coarse-grained ash or cinders above 30 inches.  The Aslik soils have no silty strata and are very cindery in the lower part of the 10 to 40 inch section.  The Kvichak soils have sandy or sandy loam substrata.  The Pustoi soils have only thin thixotropic layers in the upper part of the soil, and are formed dominantly in sandy ash.  The Umnak soils are layered, but are made up dominantly of nonthixotropic materials."

The climate is maritime, with cool summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 65 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F.; the mean January air temperature is 33 degrees F.; the mean July air temperature is 52 degrees F.; and the average growing season is 145 days."
