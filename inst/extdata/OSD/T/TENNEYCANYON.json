  "REVDATE": "08/2007",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Tenneycanyon series consists of very deep, and deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum and reworked eolian deposits derived from sandstone. Tenneycanyon soils are on hillslopes, and sand sheets on structural benches.  Slope ranges 2 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
