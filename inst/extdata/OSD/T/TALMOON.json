    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free calcium carbonate typically ranges from 18 to 44 inches, but it is greater than 60 inches in some pedons.  Rock fragments are 1 to 10 percent by volume in the 2B and 2C horizons.\nSome pedons have an Oa horizon up to 7 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2, chroma of 1 or is neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their mucky modifiers.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (5.5 or less dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Pedons with the thinner A horizons typically have an O horizon that is muck.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is neutral to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a thin BE horizon.\nThe Btg and 2Btg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Clay content is 18 to 35 percent and sand content is 25 to 55 percent.\nThe 2Cg or 2Bkg (where present) horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture typically is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, but subhorizons of sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam are common.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 30 percent and sand content from 25 to 55 percent."

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial material and underlying loamy till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 88 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1600 feet."

Very poorly drained Bluffton soils are in depressions.  Cathro soils formed in organic materials in depressions.  The poorly drained Shooker soils are on nearly level flats adjacent to Talmoon soils."
