  "OVERVIEW": "The Talmoon series consists of very deep, very poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial materials and the underlying loamy till.  They are in shallow depressions, swales and nearly level areas on till-floored lake plains and moraines.  These soils have moderate permeability in the upper part and moderately slow permeability in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

This series was formerly classified as a Mollic Ochraqualfs."
