  "STATES": "MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Trimad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, basin floors, hills and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
