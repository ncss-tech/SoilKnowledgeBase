  "OVERVIEW": "The Terrarossa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources. Terrarossa soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F (15.6 degrees C).",
