  "OVERVIEW": "The Thermalrocks series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basalt.  Thermalrocks soils are on tops of basalt plateaus in volcanic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, (711 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",

The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about April to about November (about 150 to 200 days).  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel and cobbles.  Mineralogy is mixed. Base saturation by sum of the cations ranges from 4 to 7 percent.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.  Some pedons have cobbly, very cobbly or gravelly silt loam textures throughout.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is cobbly loam, very gravelly loam, gravelly loam, loam, extremely gravelly loam or very cobbly loam.  Clay content ranges from 14 to 18 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 4 to 8 percent.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 65 percent gravel, 5 to 40 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 or 7.5YR 4/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/2, 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3 or 4/2.
