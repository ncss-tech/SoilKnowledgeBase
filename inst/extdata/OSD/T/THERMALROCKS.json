The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel and cobbles.  Mineralogy is mixed. Base saturation by sum of the cations ranges from 4 to 7 percent.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.  Some pedons have cobbly, very cobbly or gravelly silt loam textures throughout.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.
