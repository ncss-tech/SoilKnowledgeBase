The soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay, 30 to 35 percent gravel, and 25 to 45 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 15 to 35 percent cobbles and averages 25 to 35 percent total rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is loam or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 20 to 30 percent gravel and 15 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 10 to 35 percent cobbles.  Below a depth of 40 inches, stratification is common."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Takilma soils are on nearly level low stream terraces at elevations of 200 to 2,500 feet.  These soils formed in cobbly mixed alluvium.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The annual precipitation is typically 18 to 60 inches but may range up to 90 inches in the high winter rainfall areas of Curry County, Oregon.  The mean January temperature is 37 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 68 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 210 days."
