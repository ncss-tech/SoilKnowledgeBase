    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thurlow soils are usually dry when not frozen unless irrigated and they have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 5O degrees F. The nonclacareous part of the solum is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 5.5 dry and 3.5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In its upper part coated colors are one unit of value less than when crushed and less than that of the A horizon.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, dry value of 4 or 5 coated and 5 or 6 crushed, moist value of 4 or 5 crushed, and chroma of 2 to 4. It contains 35 to 45 percent clay and has 6 to 10 percent more clay than the A horizon and is highest in clay in the upper part."

Baca and Hesper soils have less than 18 percent fine and coarser sand in their pedons.  Bew soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in their Bt horizons.  Fort Collins soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Renohill soils have shale bedrock at depths of about 30 inches."
