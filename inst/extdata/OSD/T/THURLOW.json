  "OVERVIEW": "The Thurlow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous clay loam unconsolidated materials.  These soils are in valleys on river and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The nonclacareous part of the solum is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 5.5 dry and 3.5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In its upper part coated colors are one unit of value less than when crushed and less than that of the A horizon.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, dry value of 4 or 5 coated and 5 or 6 crushed, moist value of 4 or 5 crushed, and chroma of 2 to 4. It contains 35 to 45 percent clay and has 6 to 10 percent more clay than the A horizon and is highest in clay in the upper part."
