  "OVERVIEW": "The Tobincreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from calcareous siltstone, shale or sandstone residuum. These soils are on mountain slopes, stream terrace risers and hills. Slopes are 15 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
