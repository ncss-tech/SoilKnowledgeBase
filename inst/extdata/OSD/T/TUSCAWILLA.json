  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuscawilla series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils in hammocks on the lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments containing shells and shell fragments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Reaction is moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon, from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Eg horizons, from neutral to strongly alkaline in the Bt and Btk horizons, and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the BCg, Cg and 2Cg horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1; or it is neutral with value 2 to 4.  Where the value is 3 or less, the thickness of the A is less than 6 inches.  When the soil is mixed to a depth of 7 inches, the moist color value is 4 or more.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.

Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 8, chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Redoximorphic accumulations or discontinuous streaks in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 8, chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.

Soft calcium carbonate accumulations and calcium carbonate nodules range from common to many.  Discontinuous layers of hard limestone up to 6 inches thick and from 1 to 2 1/2 feet across may occur in some pedons.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Bt horizon.

They formed in sand and loamy marine sediments that contain shells and shell fragments.  Most areas are characterized by a micro relief of fairly closely spaced low broad rises that are 25 to 50 feet across and about 4 to 6 inches above the general level of the soil surface in the hammock.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

The poorly drained Bradenton soils are on similar to higher positions, have coarse-loamy control sections, and do not have Calcic horizons.  Chobee, Delray, and Manatee soils are on lower positions, do not have Calcic horizons, and are Mollisols.  In addition, Manatee soils have less clay in the control section.  The poorly or very poorly drained Felda soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The poorly and very poorly drained Holopaw and Malabar soils are on lower positions and have surface and subsurface horizons 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  The poorly and very poorly drained Myakka soils are on lower positions and are Spodosols.   Parkwood soils are on similar positions, have mollic epipedons, and have less clay in the subsoil."
