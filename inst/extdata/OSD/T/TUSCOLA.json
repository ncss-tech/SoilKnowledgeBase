Bogart, Centerburg, Haney, Jenera, Jugtown, Thackery, and Vanlue soils have 1 percent or more rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Cygnet, Houcktown, and Williamstown soils have a densic contact within the series control section. Nicely series are more than 122 cm (48 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Passport soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 122 cm (48 inches. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Scattersville and Swampoodle soils are more acid than slightly alkaline in the lower part of the series control section.
