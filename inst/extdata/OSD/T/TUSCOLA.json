  "OVERVIEW": "The Tuscola series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains and deltas. They formed in stratified loamy and silty lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
