  "OVERVIEW": "The Tigerlily series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks. The Tigerlily soils are on seeps in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
