  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock and the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Total coarse fragments range from 35 to 75 percent and consist of a mixture of pebbles, cobbles, and stones.  Pebbles range from 15 to 45 percent, cobbles from 0 to 20 percent, and stones from 0 to 25 percent.  These soils are moist in the moisture control section for the 90 days preceding July 15 but are dry for 90 cumulative days from July 15 to October 15 in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Matrix texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Textures are modified with 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments of pebbles, cobbles, or stones either mixed or separately.  It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  A thin Btk is present immediately above the bedrock in some pedons."

Teaspoon soils are moist in some part for more than 60 consecutive days following July 15 in 6 out of 10 years.  Tolbert soils formed in igneous rock at elevations less than 6000 feet.  Zibetod soils are driest during May and June."

They formed in residuum, colluvium, and slope alluvium derived predominantly from hard sandstone;  Elevations range from 6,000 to 8,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and ranges from 12 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
