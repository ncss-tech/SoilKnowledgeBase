  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunis series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Tunis soils are on uplands and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, some as snow, and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered metamorphic rock is 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F. The soil is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the period from June 21 to October 21 in 6 out of 10 years. Rock fragments are less than 15 percent throughout the profile.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon is dark gray, gray, grayish brown, brown, or dark brown (10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/3) or brown or dark brown (7.5YR 5/2, 4/2, 3/2). It is loam or sandy loam and has 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon is loam and sandy loam and has less than 18 percent clay.  It is dark gray, gray, grayish brown, brown, or dark brown (10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/3) and brown or dark brown (7.5YR 5/2, 4/2, 3/2). It has fine and medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Cr horizon consists of highly weathered material from igneous and metamorphic rock which still retains evidence of the rock structure. A few hard pieces of the original hard rock remain. Few cracks exist."

Cieneba soils have less than 18 percent clay and less than one percent organic matter. Friant, Godde and Lodo soils have a lithic contact. Also, Godde soils have a mean annual soil temperature cooler than 59 degrees F."

The soils formed in material weathered from metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Gradients are 5 to 75 percent. The climate is mediterranean with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches. Most of the moisture occurs as rain in the late autumn and winter. Some moisture falls as snow. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 62 degrees F. Average January temperature is 39 degrees F., average July temperature is 72 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 150 to 225 days."
