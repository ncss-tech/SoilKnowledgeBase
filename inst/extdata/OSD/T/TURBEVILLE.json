    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Esto and Faceville soils.  The Caroline, Collegedale, Marlboro, and Shubuta series are in related families.  Esto, Faceville, and Marlboro soils formed from clayey marine sediments and occur on uplands of the Coastal Plain.  Caroline and Shubuta soils do not have lower Bt horizons with rhodic colors, have mixed mineralogy, formed from clayey marine sediments, and occur on uplands of the Coastal Plain.  Collegedale soils are underlain by limestone residuum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level to steep slopes on high terraces bordering major streams in the Piedmont and upper Atlantic Coastal Plain.  Slope gradients are commonly from 0 to 10 percent with a range of 0 to 35 percent.  These soils developed in old alluvium derived mainly from land surfaces underlain by acid igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont Plateau.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 36 to 50 inches."
