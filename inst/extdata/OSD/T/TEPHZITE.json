  "OVERVIEW": "The Tephzite series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rock such as quartzite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Tephzite soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rocks such as quartzite or slate with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,135 to 2,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
