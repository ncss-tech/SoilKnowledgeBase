  "REVDATE": "04/2014",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Twinadams series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from hard sedimentary and igneous rock. They are on cuestas, scarp slopes, hills, mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
