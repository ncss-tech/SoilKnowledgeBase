  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunitcha series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone on backslopes of high plateaus, mesas and structural benches.  Slopes are 45 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
