  "OVERVIEW": "The Tunitas series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils.  They have formed from fine textured alluvium from mixed basic igneous and sedimentary rock sources.  Tunitas soils are on nearly level to moderately steep fan terraces and alluvial fans.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F.",
