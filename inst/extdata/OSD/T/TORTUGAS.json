Slopes are dominantly 5 to 45 percent and range from 0 to 75 percent. These soils formed on and from limestone, calcareous sandstone and shale. The climate is semiarid continental. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 60 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 100 to 220 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 24 inches falling mainly in thundershowers in July and August and as gentle rains in December and January."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 9 inches (A horizon)\nLithic contact - The boundary at 9 inches (R horizon)\nWhen the MOs were created in 1995 the responsibility for the Tortugas series was assigned to MO9 instead of MO8. The error was discovered in 2005. The responsibility for the series was transferred from MO9 to MO8 in April 2005.\nThe type location was moved to Yavapai County in March 2006. The previous type location in the San Simon Area in Cochise County was correlated to the Mabray series in 1975. The Tortugas series was not correlated in that soil survey area and the type location should have been moved then.\nThe classification was changed to an Aridic Lithic subgroup in March 2006 to be consistent with the soil moisture regime. Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ninth Edition, 2003.\nThe series was inactivated in March 2006 due to questionable concept and broad misuse.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
