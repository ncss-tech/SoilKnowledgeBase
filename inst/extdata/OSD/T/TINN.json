    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification of the Tinn series was changed from Vertic Haplaquolls to Typic Pelluderts (3/88).  This change was based on several years study and analysis of the soils mapped in the Tinn series.  The series type location was moved from Hill County to Limestone County to a pedon that is near the center of the series range in characteristics and near the center of the geographic distribution.  Classification change from Typic Pelluderts to Typic Hapluderts based on Amendment 16, SOIL TAXONOMY (2/94).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon:  0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in) (Ap, A horizons)\nVertic Properties: slickensides from 46 to 203 cm (18 to 80 in) (Bss1, Bss2, Bkssy horizons)\nGypsum accumulations: 183 to 203 cm (72 to 80 in) (Bkssy horizons)\nIdentifiable secondary calcium carbonate:  71 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in) (Bss2, Bss3, Bkssy horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Laboratory data from Caldwell County (S10TX0550011)\nKSSL Data from Bell County, TX (S08TX027004)\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
