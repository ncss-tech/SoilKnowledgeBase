  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingsbeach series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or colluvium derived from andesite over lacustrine deposits. The Kingsbeach soils are on alluvial fan. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 635 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
