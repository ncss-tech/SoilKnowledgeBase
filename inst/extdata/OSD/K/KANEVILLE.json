  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaneville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash on till plains, outwash plains, stream terraces, and pingos. Slope gradients range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
