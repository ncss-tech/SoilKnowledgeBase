Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral, depending upon liming practices.\nAn E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The lower part of the Bt horizon contains redoximorphic features which have chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Average clay content ranges from 25 to 34 percent.

Slope gradients range from 0 to 10 percent. These soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and in loamy stratified outwash. The mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1020 mm (30 to 40 inches). Frost free days range from 140 to 180. The elevation ranges from 200 to 311 m (655 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Barony soils, and Drummer, Elburn, Flanagan, and Virgil soils. The Barony soils are on similar landform positions nearby where the loess mantle is thinner. The poorly drained Drummer soils have mollic epipedons and are on nearly level positions and in depressions. Elburn, Flanagan, and Virgil soils are generally less sloping and are somewhat poorly drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. An intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) below the surface at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low on the gentle slopes and medium on the steeper slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and moderately high to high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum."
