  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Other series in closely related families are Fisk and Nebago.  Fisk soils have carbonates below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and are sandy over loamy.  Nebago soils are similar, but are sandy over clayey."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Korobago soils are adjacent to drainageways in broad, concave areas between the more sloping rises of ground moraines.  Slope ranges from  0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in medium or coarse-textured outwash or lacustrine deposits and in   clayey till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 737 mm (25 to 29 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 7.8 to 9.4 degrees C (46 to 49 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Keowns, Kewaunee, Manawa, and Wauseon soils.  The poorly drained Wauseon soils are in a drainage sequence with the Korobago soils.  Keowns soils are in lower-lying, contiguous areas that are not underlain by clayey deposits within a depth or 102 cm ( 40 inches).  The well drained and moderately well drained Kewaunee soils occupy higher positions on the landscape where the clayey glacial till is not buried by lacustrine deposits.  The somewhat poorly drained Manawa soils occupy similar positions on the landscape, but do not have the covering of lacustrine deposits."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Internal drainage is restricted by the massive substratum.  The potential for surface runoff is negligible or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy upper story and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the clayey till. Permeability is moderate in the loamy upper story and slow in the clayey till.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) for some time in most years."
