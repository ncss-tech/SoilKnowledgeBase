  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 44 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel, range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 30 percent in substratum. Unless limed, reaction of the soil ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Unplowed areas have thin A horizons with value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam above depths of 20 inches and loamy fine sand or loamy sand below. The dominant sand size is fine sand. Structure is weak or very weak subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons have an AB or BA horizon above the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Some pedons have redoximorphic concentrations below 40 inches. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to sand in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have a 2C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Hartford and Merrimac series are in the same family. Hartford soils are 5YR or redder in the B and 2C horizons and contain more than 35 percent rock fragments in the 2C horizon. Merrimac soils generally contain more rock fragments in the solum and more than 30 percent rock fragments in the 2C horizon.\nSimilar soils in related families are the Agawam, Hoosic, Riverhead and Windsor series. Agawam soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size class. Hoosic soils are sandy-skeletal. Riverhead soils are coarse-loamy with sandy loam or fine sandy loam mantles at least 24 inches thick. Windsor soils are loamy fine sand or coarser throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Knickerbocker soils are nearly level to steep soils on lake plains and terraces. These soils formed in stratified sandy deltaic or fluvial deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches and the frost-free season ranges from 130 to 190 days. The elevation ranges from 100 to 800 feet above sea level."

Castile soils are moderately well drained and contain more rock fragments throughout. Elmridge soils are moderately well drained and are underlain by clayey deposits. Elnora soils are moderately well drained and sandy throughout. Walpole soils are somewhat poorly drained to poorly drained and they occur in low-lying wetter areas."
