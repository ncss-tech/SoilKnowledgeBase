  "OVERVIEW": "The Kainaliu series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 890 millimeters (35 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).",

These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to steep `a`a lava flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 640 to 1270 millimeters (25 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 75 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
