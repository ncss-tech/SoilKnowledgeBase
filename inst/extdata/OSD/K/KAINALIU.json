    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kainaliu soils are on low elevation, leeward slopes of Mauna Loa and Hualalai volcanoes at elevations from sea level to 305 meters (0 to 1000 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to steep `a`a lava flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 640 to 1270 millimeters (25 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 75 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
