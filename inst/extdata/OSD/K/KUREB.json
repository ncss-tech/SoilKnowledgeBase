    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy horizons is more than 80 inches.  Soil reaction is neutral to extremely acid throughout.  All horizons are fine sand, sand, or coarse sand.  Silt plus clay content is less than 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Tongues of E horizon are in old root channels in the C/Bh horizon.\nThe C part of the C/Bh horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  The Bh part of the C/Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Few to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or gray are in the C horizon of some pedons.  Gray mottles are the result of uncoated sand grains and not wetness."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  (Not updated) Resota series is the only soil in the same family.  Alaga, Alpin, Cainhoy, Centenary, Corolla, Foxworth, Fripp, Kershaw, Lakehurst, Lakeland, Lakewood, Newhan, Orsimo, Ousley, Paola, Resota, Rimini, and Welaka series are in closely related families.  Resota soils are moderately well drained and have seasonal high water table at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Alaga, Alpin, Corolla, Foxworth, Fripp, Kershaw, Lakeland, Newhan, Paola, and Wekaka soils lack an intermittent Bh horizon.  In addition, Alaga soils have 10 to 25 percent percent silt plus clay in 10- to 40-inch control section.  Alpin soils have lamella beginning at depths of 40 to 70 inches.  Corolla and Newham soils are affected by salt spray.  Lakeland soils have 5 to 10 percent silt plus clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Ousley soils have a seasonal watertable at 1.5 to 30 feet.  Paola soils are hyperthermic and Welaka have Bir horizons.  Cainhoy soils have an E' horizon underlain by Bh horizon.  Centenary soils have Bh horizon in subsoil.  Lakehurst soils occur in mesic temperature regimes.  Rimini soils have a thick sandy E horizon overlying a continuous spodic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kureb soils are gently sloping to moderately steep and are on broad surfaces of the lower Coastal Plain.  Gradients are 3 to 10 percent and may range to 20 percent on side slopes along streams and edges of bays.  The regolith is marine, aeolian or fluvial sands.  Near the type location mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F."
