  "OVERVIEW": "The Kadletz series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite.  Kadletz soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 6 percent.  Permeability is moderate over rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Snowslide and Simeroi soils have loamy-skeletal control sections.  Leatherman soils are shallow to a duripan and have cryic soil temperature regimes.  Pahsimeroi and Whitecloud soils have an aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric and have more organic carbon in the surface layer than Kadletz soils. Ringle soils have a calcic horizon within 40 inches of the surface and are calcareous in the upper soil to a depth of 7 inches after mixing."
