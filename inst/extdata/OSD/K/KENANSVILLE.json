    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The soil ranges from very strongly through moderately acid in all horizons, unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The A horizon is less than 6 inches thick if its color value, moist, is less than 3.5.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is similar to the A or Ap horizon.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sandy, loamy fine sand or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Thin layers of sandy clay loam are present in some pedons.\nThe BC, or B/C horizon, where present, has similar matrix color as the Bt horizon.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is sand or loamy sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: (This section not checked this date; added activity class)  The Baymeade, Blaney, Chipola, Chisolm, Coosaw, Garcon, Gomery, Remlik, Tenaha, Tomahawk, Uchee, and Valhalla series are in the same family.  Alaga, Bassfield, Conetoe, Eustis, Galestown, Kamia, Latonia, Maxton, Molena, Pocalla, Rumford, Valhalla, Wagram, and Wakulla series are in closely related family.  Baymead soils have A and B horizons with irregular intermittent Bh bodies.  Blaney soils have a Bt horizon that is compact and brittle in part of the mass.  Chipola and Chisolm soils have Bt horizons with redder hues.  Coosaw and Garcon soils have low chroma mottles in the lower Bt horizon.  Also, Garcon have less clayey Bt horizons.  Gomery and Tenaha soils are underlain by soft bedrock.  Remlik soils have common lamellae in the C horizon and are commonly on 6 to 45 percent slopes.  Tomahawk soils have Bh horizon in lower part of solum.  Also, they are somewhat poorly drained.  Uchee soils have a clayey lower Bt horizon with moderately slow permeability.  Valhalla soils have buried E and Bt horizons.  Alaga, Eustis, Galestown, Molena, and Wakulla soils have coarser textures.  In addition, Galestown soils are mesic and Molena soils have mixed mineralogy.  Bassfield and Lotonia soils lack the arenic surface layer.  Conetoe soils have mixed mineralogy.  Kalmia and Maxton soils thinner A horizon and finer textures Bt horizon. Pocalla soils are bisequal.  Rumford soils have thinner A horizons and redder Bt horizons.  Wagram soils have thicker sola."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kenansville soils are on nearly level to gently sloping Coastal Plain uplands and stream terraces.  They formed in Coastal Plain and stream terrace sediments.  Kenansville soils generally are on the smoother parts of the landscape between the higher, sandier ridges and the lower wet areas.  Slope gradients are commonly 0 to 4 percent with a full range up to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 48 inches and mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F. near the type location."

Cahaba, Eunola, and Foreston soils lack thick sandy epipedons.  Johns soils have low chroma mottles indicative of wetness in the Bt horizon.  Lakeland soils are sandy and do not have Bt horizons."
