The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1300 to 1650 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 6 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 17 degrees C., and the mean annual temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C. Frost free period is about 200 to 280 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 33 centimeters (A1, A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 33 to 95 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nParticle size control section - the zone from 33 to 83 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nAquultic subgroup - the zone from 33 to 180 cm (Bt1, Bt2, C1, C2, C3 horizons)\nThe type location was moved in 2014 from UTM Zone 10 399562mE, 4478145mN to locate the series in an area with somewhat poorly drained soils.\nKinman was proposed in the 1959 State Cooperative Soil-Vegetation Survey.  The soil was formerly classified in the Prairie group. Lab data from three soils(Peaked 07N0346, Forhaux 07N0347, and Pigtoe 07N0348) near the original type location all have BS below 50% (NH4OAc) at the surface, superactive CEC activity classes, and less than 75% BS (sum of cations) in some horizon above 75 cm. However, pH of most soils indicates higher B.S. and parent material in area is weathered from gouge material of chloritic schist. The original Kinman was moderately well to somewhat poorly drained. Minerology was changed from vermiculitic to mixed because of a preponderance of local lab data.  The soil temperature regime was changed from isomesic to mesic because of a preponderance of soil temperature data."
