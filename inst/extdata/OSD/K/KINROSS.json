  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 16 to 55 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma to 0 or 2. It is muck or mucky peat. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have A horizons 1 to 6 inches thick that have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 1 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are mucky sand, mucky fine sand, mucky loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.  Where present the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and Ap horizons have reactions that are extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 5Y, and 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand. Mottling is faint or distinct. The organic matter content of the upper 10 inches of soil (Oa and E horizons) is less than 12 percent. Reaction of the E horizon is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sand, fine sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; and value and chroma of 3 to 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together in the horizon.  Mottling is faint or there is none in the E horizons, but it is always in the upper part of the Bhs horizon. In some pedons there is a Bs horizon above the Bhs horizon.  The Bs horizons are sand, fine sand, or loamy sand. Reaction ranges form extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of  5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.  In some pedons this horizon is prominently mottled and in other pedons there is no mottling.  Strata of coarse sand or fine gravel occur in the C horizon of some pedons. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Au Gres, Battlefield and Wainola and Wormet series. All of these soils are saturated for a period of 70 to 90 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. In addition Battlefield soils are underlain by gravelly sand and have carbonates within 40 inches.  The Wormet soils have a loamy textured cap 10 to 20 inches thick."
