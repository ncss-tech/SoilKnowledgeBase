Typically, the control section does not have rock fragments, but the C horizon can have up to 5 percent by volume. The control section averages more than 25 percent fine sand.\nThe Ap, A, and AB horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or less commonly 7.5 YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or less commonly 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 5. It is fine sand or sand. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

Kaks soils have 1 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Lohnes soils have free carbonates at less than 60 inches, and more than 25 percent medium sand and coarser in the control section. Maddock soils have carbonates within 60 inches."

The Kost soil formed in outwash sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to 17 inches (Ap, A and AB horizons); udic moisture regime; frigid temperature regime.\nA banded substratum (lamellae) and till substratum phase are recognized.  These features are below a depth of 60 inches.\nThe central concept of this soil was outwash from the Des Moines lobe.  Where occuring as outwash from the Superior Lobe (or other lobes) the colors include 7.5 YR and may be more acidic.  The associated soils are those in and around the type location.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
