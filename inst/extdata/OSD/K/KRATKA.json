  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 6 to 18 inches. The depth to loamy glacial till or lacustrine sediments ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Some pedons have stratified sediments below 40 inches. The depth to carbonates typically ranges from 16 to 45 inches but ranges to more than 60 inches in some pedons. The upper sediments have 0 to 5 percent gravel and the 2C horizon contains 0 to 8 percent by volume of gravel of mixed lithology. In pedons that have lacustrine sediments in the 2C horizons, rock fragments may not be present. A thin lag line ranging to as much as 6 inches in thickness and containing as much as 35 percent by volume of gravel is at the contact between the upper and lower material. The reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the A and Bg horizons, slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the Cg horizons and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the 2Cg horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an ABg horizon.\nThe Bg or Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part, and includes chroma of 3 or 4 in the lower part. It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, sand or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have Bkg or 2Bkg horizons with 2.5Y or 5Y hue. They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have 2Bg horizons with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3. Textures include loam or clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have thin Ab horizons.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the glacial till and silt loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam, with thin strata of loamy fine sand or fine sand in the lacustrine material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes on flats or in shallow depressions on stream terraces, glacial lake plains, glacial deltas of former glacial lakes, and glacial moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Kratka soils formed in a sandy mantle of lacustrine glacial outwash over loamy glacial till or lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 33 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 88 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,500 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These typically include the Foldahl, Grimstad, Rockwell, Strathcona and Towner soils which formed in similar materials. The Foldahl and Grimstad soils are moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained. Rockwell and Strathcona soils have a calcic horizon and the Towner soils are moderately well drained. They are also associated with Blomford and Braham soils in a few places. Blomford are poorly drained soils on plane slopes and Braham are well drained and moderately well drained soils on plane and convex slopes."

Surface runoff is negligible. Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is 0.5 to 1.5 feet at some time from April to July in normal years for the poorly drained phases and at plus 1 to 0.5 feet at some time from March to August in normal years for the very poorly drained phase."
