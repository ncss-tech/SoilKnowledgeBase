  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenhill series consists of soils that are moderately deep, well drained, and moderately permeable above a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Kenhill soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
