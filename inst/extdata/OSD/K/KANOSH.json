  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kanosh soils are on low lake terraces, deltas, and flood plains.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid and the mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 115 to 180 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 1.5 and 3.5 feet (shallow to deep free water occurrence classes) between March and October.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  For short periods during wet years the saturation may be at or near the soil surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 inches (A horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 4 to 60 inches (Bk, Bky1, Bky2, and Bky3 horizons).\nGypsic horizon - The zone from 8 to 60 inches (Bky1, Bky2, and Bky3 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 18 and 42 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bky1, Bky2, and Bky3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bky2 horizon and parts of the Bky1 and Bky3 horizons).\nThe active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data.\nThe taxonomic placement in the Aridisol order needs additional study.  There is not enough salt accumulation to meet the salic horizon requirement. It needs to be determined if a moisture control section of about 8 to 24 inches would have an aridic moisture regime with the seasonal water table from 18 to 42 inches.\nThe taxonomic classification was changed from Aquic Calciorthids to Xeric Calcigypsids in September 1994.\nThe type location was moved from Millard County to Tooele County in 1990 to better represent the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
