    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F.  The soils are saturated most of the year.  Chroma, moist, is 2 or less to a depth of 20 inches or more. The mineral fraction is ash and pumice. Depth to the very paragravelly or extremely paragravelly pumice and ash layers ranges from 14 to 38 inches. The transition between the upper part of the particle-size control section (A horizons) and the lower part (AB horizon) is gradual or clear.  The solum commonly is neutral or slightly acid but ranges to very strongly alkaline in the surface horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, neutral, or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 0 to 1 dry. It has 0 to 15 percent pumice of gravel size. It has 12 to 20 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample.  Phosphate retention is 25 to 35 percent.  It has 40 to 70 percent glass.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 1.0.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist, 1 or 2 dry.  It is ashy sandy loam or ashy loamy sand with 15 to 35 percent gravel-size pumice.  It hs 8 to 12 percent 15 bar water on dried samples, 60 to 90 percent glass, phosphate retention of 25 to 35 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 1.0.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist, 2 or 3 dry. It is ashy loamy sand, ashy sand, or ashy coarse sand and has about 30 to 50 percent pumice of gravel size and 5 to 25 percent pumice of cobble size. It has 15-bar moisture of 3 to 8 percent based on an air-dried sample."

The soils formed in very deep alluvial deposits of ash and pumice from dacitic pumice flows.  The climate is characterized by cold winters with much snow and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 to 27 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons) with an average of 6 percent organic matter.\nAndic properties - from 0 to 60 inches (A1, A2, A3, AB, and BC horizons)\nParticle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches and based on the thickest part (upper 25 inches of BC horizon) which meets ashy-pumiceous family criteria.  The upper 9 inches meet medial criteria; the zone from 9 to 15 inches meet ashy criteria; and the zone from 15 to 40 inches meet ashy-pumiceous criteria.  The pedon and the ranges of 15 bar water (dried) for the medial and ashy parts of the control section do not met the requirements for a medial over ashy contrasting particle-size class when a combination of 15 bar values are associated with the gradual or clear boundary between the A and AB horizon.\nAquic feature - dominant chroma, moist, of 1 or 2 throughout and redox with chroma of 2 beginning at 15 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data of 2 profiles (S67Oreg. 18-13 and 18-14) reported in Riverside Soil Survey Laboratory report for Kirk soils sampled in Klamath County, Oregon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
