Below 40 inches, rock fragment content by volume averages 0 to 35 percent gravel and from 0 to 10 percent cobbles, but individual horizons may contain more. The soil ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is stratified loamy fine sand, sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, loamy sand or their gravelly analogues. Very gravelly analogues may be present below a depth of 40 inches.\nBuried A horizons are present in some places."
