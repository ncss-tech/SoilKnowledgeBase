  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Usually these soils are calcareous throughout but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is typically loam or silt loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 30 to 70 percent, and sand from 12 to 50 percent. Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent, and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos/cm in a major part of the control section.  Continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate do not occur within the control section although some visible accumulation occurs in some pedons.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from 100 to 400 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay, and there is some volcanic ash and glass throughout the fine earth in the control section. Rock fragments are mainly 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter.  A majority of subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  The control section of some pedons has a few faint redoximorphic features and the chroma of both the matrix and redoximorphic features exceeds 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry and 3 to 7 moist, and chroma from 1 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from 4 to 14 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Keota soils are on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in, calcareous, silty and loamy materials weathered residually or only locally transported from exposures of Brule deposits.  At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 48 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 73 degrees F."
