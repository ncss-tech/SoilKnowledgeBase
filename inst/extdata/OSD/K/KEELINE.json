  "OVERVIEW": "The Keeline series consists of very deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Keeline soils are on upland ridgetops, hillslopes, terraces, benches, alluvial fans, and fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Free carbonates typically occur throughout the profile, but some pedons may be leached as much as 6 inches.  The control section averages fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent. Some thin strata of coarser material may occur.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.   The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days. EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos throughout the profile.  Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam and less commonly loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has the same properties of the A except for structure which is usually weak subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture averages sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have subhorizons of very fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline and some pedons have weak, discontinuous accumulations of calcium carbonate."

Nelman, Shedado, and Uendal soils have lithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Nelson and Turnercrest soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Cliff, Councelor, Henrieville, Otero, Pedrick and Zia soils are not dry for 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section from July 15 to October 25.

These soils formed in moderately coarse alluvium or eolian deposits derived from calcareous sandstone.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 12 inches with over one-half of the annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. but ranges from 44 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
