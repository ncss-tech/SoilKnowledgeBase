  "OVERVIEW": "The Kellycreek series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from red, calcareous conglomerate or other red sedimentary rock.   These soils occur on hills, escarpments and eroded fan remnants. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
