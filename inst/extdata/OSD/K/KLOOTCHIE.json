    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 4 to 12 inches after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and the mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches or more.  It is extremely to strongly acid throughout.  The particle-size control section has a moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeters acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2 to 4 percent, and phosphate retention of 90 to 100 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is medial silt loam with 15 to 22 percent clay by field estimate and 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent pararock fragments. Organic matter is 10 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4, 5, or 6 dry, and chroma of 4, 5, or 6 moist and dry.  It is medial silt loam, medial loam, medial clay loam or medial silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay by field estimate. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 40 percent pararock fragments.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4, 5, or 6 moist and dry.  It is medial loam, medial silt loam, or medial silty clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay by field estimate.  It has 15 to 35 percent basalt gravel and 0 to 40 percent pararock fragments."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Calawah, Ilwaco, Knappton, Lint, Lytell, Mopang, Narel, Neotsu, Neskowin, Newskah, Palix, Papac, Queets and Salander series.  Calawah soils are greater than 40 inches to 2B horizons formed from glacial outwash.  Ilwaco soils are very deep and have up to 15 percent sandstone paragravel.  Knappton soils are 40 or more inches to a lithic bedrock contact.  Lebam soils are very deep and have 35 to 55 percent clay in the Bw (cambic) horizon.  Lint soils lack rock fragments within the upper 40 inches and are formed in alluvium.  Lytell soils have 35 to 60 percent siltstone or sandstone paragravel in the Bw (cambic) horizon.  Mopang, Ozette, and Papac soils are deep to a Cd horizon.  Narel soils are deep to a paralithic feldsparic sandstone bedrock contact and have 30 to 75 percent sandstone paragravel in the Bw (cambic) horizon.  Neotsu and Neskowin soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Newskah soils are very deep and have 15 to 20 percent clay in the Bw (cambic) horizon.  Palix soils are deep to a paralithic sandstone bedrock contact and have 20 to 80 percent siltstone paragravel in the Bw (cambic) horizon.  Salander soils have an umbric epipedon greater than 20 inches thick.  Queets soils lack an umbric epipedon and are derived from recent alluvium on flood plains."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klootchie soils are on mountain ridgetops and side slopes.  Elevations are 50 to 1800 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from volcanic rock.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 130 inches.  The average annual temperature is 44 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 210 days."
