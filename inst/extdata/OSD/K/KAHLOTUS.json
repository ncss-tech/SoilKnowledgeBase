  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kahlotus soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments at elevations of 300 to 2,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in glaciofluvial sediments mixed with loess in the upper part. These soils are in a semi-arid climate with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 7l degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free season is 150 to 180 days."

Roloff soils are coarse-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact with basalt. Starbuck soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact with basalt. Stratford soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Ritzville soils are on uplands including plateaus, benches, and canyon side slopes.  Roloff and Starbuck soils are on benches, ridges, escarpments, and hillslopes.  Stratfprd soils are on terraces and outwash plains."
