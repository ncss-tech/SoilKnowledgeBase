  "OVERVIEW": "The Kahlotus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial sediments and mixed with loess in the upper part. Kahlotus soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 7l degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.

Roloff soils are coarse-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact with basalt. Starbuck soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact with basalt. Stratford soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Ritzville soils are on uplands including plateaus, benches, and canyon side slopes.  Roloff and Starbuck soils are on benches, ridges, escarpments, and hillslopes.  Stratfprd soils are on terraces and outwash plains."
