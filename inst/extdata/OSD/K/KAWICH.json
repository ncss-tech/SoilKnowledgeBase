Ecklund soils have a lithic contact at moderate depth.  Kewake soils do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation and contain 5 to 30 percent sand sized pumice. Hawsley and Isolde are not moist 10 to 20 days in the summer.  Razito soils receive more moisture during the late summer and fall and lack pyroclastic material. Sheppard soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder, and do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Stumble and Sundown soils have a loamy fine sand particle-size control section. Stumble soils also lack carbonate in the upper 25 to 38 cm and have a weak Bk horizon. Tipper soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Tipperary soils lack pyroclastic material.  Tricera soils have carbonate accumulation at a depth of 100 cm or more.  Tricera soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the A horizon. Yenrab soils lack pyroclastic material."

Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,225 to 1,936 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 to 200 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free season is 100 to 150 days."
