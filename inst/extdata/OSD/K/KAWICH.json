  "OVERVIEW": "The Kawich series consists of deep and very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand derived from mixed rocks. Kawich soils are on stabilized dunes.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Ecklund soils have a lithic contact at moderate depth.  Kewake soils do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation and contain 5 to 30 percent sand sized pumice. Hawsley and Isolde are not moist 10 to 20 days in the summer.  Razito soils receive more moisture during the late summer and fall and lack pyroclastic material. Sheppard soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder, and do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Stumble and Sundown soils have a loamy fine sand particle-size control section. Stumble soils also lack carbonate in the upper 25 to 38 cm and have a weak Bk horizon. Tipper soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Tipperary soils lack pyroclastic material.  Tricera soils have carbonate accumulation at a depth of 100 cm or more.  Tricera soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the A horizon. Yenrab soils lack pyroclastic material."
