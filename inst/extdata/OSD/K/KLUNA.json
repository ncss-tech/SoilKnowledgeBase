  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  The upper part of the control section is stratified very sand through silt with composite texture of sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  The composite texture contains less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The lower part of the control section is stratified sand through silt with composite texture of fine sand, sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 40 to over 60 inches with coarse fragment contents that range from 40 to 70 percent rounded gravel and cobble.   The soil is moderately acid or neutral in the A and C horizons and neutral to mildly alkaline in the 2C horizons.  The organic mat ranges from  1 to 4 inches.\nThe A or AC horizon has moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture includes very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam.  This horizon is finely stratified in many pedons.\nThe C and Cg horizons have moist hue from 10YR through 5Y; moist value from 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is stratified sand, fine sandy loam, and silt loam.  Composite texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.   Dark colors are due to the high concentration of black sand grains.  Occasional pockets and strata of organic materials occur and have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Common to many mottles occur in the lower horizons in many pedons; when present, oxidation mottles have hue of 5YR through 10YR; chroma moist of 4 through 6; reduction mottles have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe 2C horizon (when present) variegated or hue from 10YR through 5Y; moist value from 3 through 5; and moist chroma of 1 through 3.  Textures include coarse sand or sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 70 percent with 25 to 65 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobble."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches, and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual  temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."
