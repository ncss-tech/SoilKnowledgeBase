  "OVERVIEW": "The Kolar series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvial material.  These soils are on hillslopes, mesas, and ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",

Blakeney soils have soil temperatures from 64 to 70 degrees F.  Conger soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Jerag soils have an argillic horizon.  Kimbrough soils have a mollic epipedon.  Simona, Upton and Wink soils are dry for more than 3/4 the time (typic/aridic).  Veal soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon within 20 inches of the surface."
