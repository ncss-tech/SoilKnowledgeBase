Blakeney soils have soil temperatures from 64 to 70 degrees F.  Conger soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Jerag soils have an argillic horizon.  Kimbrough soils have a mollic epipedon.  Simona, Upton and Wink soils are dry for more than 3/4 the time (typic/aridic).  Veal soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon within 20 inches of the surface."
