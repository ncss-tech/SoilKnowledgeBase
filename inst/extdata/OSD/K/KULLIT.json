Soils in similar families are the Ackwater, Addielou, Angie, Avilla, Chrysler, Dallardsville, Exum, Felker, Fetzer, Foreston, Hamden, Harleston, Katy, Keltys, Ocilla, Octavia, Ruston, Sawyer, Shuster, Smithdale, Tiak, and Wetsaw series.  Ackwater, Angie, Chrysler, Shuster, and Tiak soils have clayey control sections.  Addielou, Avilla, Octavia, Ruston, and Smithdale soils lack wetness mottles within 30 inches of the surface.  Dallardsville, Foreston, and Harleston soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Exum, Felker, and Sawyer soils have fine-silty control sections.  Fetzer, Hamden, Katy, and Wetsaw soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent throughout the Bt horizon.  Goldsboro, Izagora, Quitman, and Wrightsboro soils lack 5YR or redder hues in any part of the Bt horizon.  In addition, Quitman, and Goldsboro soils have less than 35 percent clay content in the lower Bt horizon and Izagora has more than 30 percent silt in the control section.  Keltys soils have solum less than 60 inches thick.  Ocilla soils have sandy epipedons more than 20 inches thick."
