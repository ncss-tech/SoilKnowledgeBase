  "OVERVIEW": "The Kerrdam series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed silty, lacustrine, and eolian deposits.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, lake plains and terraces, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
