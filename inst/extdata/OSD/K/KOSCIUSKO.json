Amanda and Caprell soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon. Belmont, High Gap, Lumberton, Military, Pignut, and Woodbine soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Belmore and Kidder soils have textures finer than coarse sand in the lower part of the series control section. Chili, Kanawha, and Skelton soils have sola thicker than 102 cm (40 inches). Cliftycreek, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, Martinsville, Ockley, Princeton, Richardville, and Riddles soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Conestoga, Hollinger, Senachwine, Wawaka, and Wawasee soils average less than 55 percent sand in the particle-size control section. LeRoy and Strawn soils are less than 61 cm (24 inches) to carbonates. Mocksville soils are in a wetter climate with a mean annual precipitation of more than 1016 mm (40 inches). Relay soils do not have rock fragments dominated by igneous pebbles."

Kosciusko soils formed in loamy gravelly outwash overlying stratified calcareous, very gravelly coarse sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.8 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F)."

The somewhat excessively drained Casco soils are on similar slopes but have thinner sola. Ockley and Oshtemo soils are on nearby landscapes and have thicker sola. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Sebewa soils are on nearby landscapes and have mollic epipedons and skeletal control sections."
