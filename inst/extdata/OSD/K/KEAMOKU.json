  "OVERVIEW": "The Keamoku series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ashfields deposited on basic `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 1,400 millimeters (55 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
