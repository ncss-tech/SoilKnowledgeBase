  "OVERVIEW": "The Krem series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly over moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian sands and underlying glacial till on uplands.  These soils have slope ranging from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 15 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy sediments and depth to loamy glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil contains up to 10 percent by volume of gravel, mainly in the loamy glacial till.  A thin stone line is at the boundary between the sandy and loamy materials in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon commonly is more than 20 inches thick.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days per year in 6 out of 10 years.  The particle-size control section has more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand and 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand or loamy sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe BA and Bw horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  They are neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam.  It typically averages between 25 to 35 percent clay but ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay.  In some pedons this horizon does not have carbonates.  In some pedons this horizon has thin sand lenses.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have 2Bk, 2BC or 2C horizons."

In addition, Flaxton soils are pachic.  Lihen, Parshall, Seroco and Telfer soils do not have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Lihen, Seroco and Telfer soils have sand textures throughout the 10-to 40-inch control sections and Parshall soils are coarse-loamy."
