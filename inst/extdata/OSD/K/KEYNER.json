  "OVERVIEW": "The Keyner series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in moderately coarse sediments weathered from calcareous, sodic sandstone interbedded with shale.  Keyner soils are on relict alluvial terraces and fans.  Slopes are typically simple and range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the natric horizon and to horizons of maximum carbonate accumulation ranges from 11 to 32 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  Rock fragments are typically less than 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent fine rounded gravel.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 0 through 3.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  This horizon is noncalcareous unless recharged by runon water or dust.  Reaction is neutral through strongly alkaline.  A thin A horizon is present in some pedons above the E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is typically sandy clay loam but may range to loam and clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 0 to 40 percent silt and more than 40 percent sand with over 35 percent sand being fine or coarser.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has the same color and texture properties as the Bt horizon.  EC ranges from 2 to 16 mmhos. Exchangeable sodium ranges from 10 to 15 percent.  Reaction is commonly very strongly alkaline and less commonly strongly alkaline.\nThe Btnk horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam with 15 to 35 percent clay. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 14 percent of which about three-fourths is pedogenetic.  EC ranges from 2 to 16 mmhos depending upon salt accumulations.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  Other subordinate suffixes such as y or z are common.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam.  Carbonates and salts are present, but over three-fourths are considered to be allogenic.  Some discontinuous thin horizons containing pedogenetic carbonates and salts are common.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 40 in the upper part and decreases rapidly with depth. Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  The Absted, Arvada, and Muff series are similar.  Absted and Arvada soils have more than 35 percent clay in the natric horizon.  In addition, the Arvada soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the upper Bt horizon.  Muff soils are moderately deep and have less than .6 percent organic carbon in the upper 15 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Keyner soils are on relict alluvial terraces, fans, and fan aprons.  These soils formed in moderately coarse sediments weathered from calcareous, sodic sandstone interbedded with thin lenses of shale.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3800 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with cold dry winters, cool moist springs, and dry warm summers.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 43 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 105 to about 130 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and local air drainage."

Zigweid soils have nonsodic cambic horizons and less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the control section."
