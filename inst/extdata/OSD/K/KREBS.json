Summers are warm and dry with an average July temperature of 68 degrees F.  Winters are cool and moist with an average January temperature of 32 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  Precipitation ranges from 9 to 10 inches annual.  The frost free period is 140 to 180 days."
