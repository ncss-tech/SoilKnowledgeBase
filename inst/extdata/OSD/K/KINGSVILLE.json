  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the dark surface ranges from 5 to 9 inches, mixed surface to 7 inches must make mollic colors. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and 0 to 10 percent in the substratum. Unconforming gravely layers up to 4 inches thick may occur within the solum. Depth to carbonates ranges from 50 to greater than 80 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture commonly is loamy fine sand, fine sand, sand or loamy sand, and less commonly fine sandy loam, mucky loamy fine sand, mucky sand or mucky fine sand. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. The chroma ranges to 3 if hue is 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral. Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, sand or is stratified. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to medium, subangular blocky or granular. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is loamy fine sand to loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or is stratified. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Glendora, Kanza, Marlake, Pay, Plev, Tobico, and Vestaburg soils. Glendora soils formed in alluvium and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon in the series control section. Kanza and Plev soils have a higher mean annual temperatures. Marlake and Tobico soils typically have carbonates at a depth of 0 to 15 inches. Pay soils average 15 to 45 percent gravel in the substratum and have mean annual temperatures ranging from 45 to 48 degrees F. Vestaburg soils have carbonates within a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 29 to 39 inches, and mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. The frost free period is 160 to 198 days, and elevation ranges from 570 to 680 feet above msl."

The well drained Colonie, moderately well drained Elnora and somewhat poorly drained Stafford soils are in a drainage sequence with Kingsville soils. Harbor soils are moderately well drained and are on higher landscape positions. The excessively drained Otisville soils and the somewhat excessively drained Tyner soils are on adjacent beach ridges. Painesville soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on higher landscape positions."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very low. Frequent brief ponding occurs during periods of heavy rainfall and during spring snowmelt. Permeability is rapid. Depth to an intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is +1.0 to 0.0 foot from October to June in most years."

(Too thin to qualify as mollic.)\nAquic conditions - from a depth of 0 to 80 inches.\nUdic moisture regime.\nA new typifying pedon for the Kingsville series was correlated during the modernization of the Ashtabula County Soil Survey.\nIt is anticipated that soils correlated as Kingsville in MLRA's other than MLRA 100 will be correlated as a new series in future modernization projects.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon AB-126 for characterization data on the typical pedon, sample numbers 26841 - 26850, and pedon AB-115, sample numbers 12710 - 12718, from Ashtabula County, Ohio; to pedon LK-6, sample numbers 19004 - 19006, from Lake County, Ohio.
