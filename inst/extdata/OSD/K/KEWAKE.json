Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,555 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Icene soils are fine-loamy and have salic horizons. Ozamis soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons, and an aquic moisture regime. Reese soils are fine-loamy and have an aquic moisture regime. All of these soils are on bolson floors."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The revision of July 2003 updates the taxonomic class from Mixed, mesic Typic Torripsamments. This revision is based on the described pumiceous sand grain content in the typical pedon and range in characteristics. Future study is needed to determine whether volcanic glass content is actually more than 30 percent, which would place in the series in the ashy, glassy family.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 17 cm (A and part of the C horizon).\nVitrandic intergrade properties - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (A, C, and Ck1 horizons and part of the Ck2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Ck1 horizon and part of the Ck2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
