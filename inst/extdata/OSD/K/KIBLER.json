  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Kibler soils were previously mapped as Edneytown soils. Few faint clay films in the B horizon indicate translocation of clay has occurred; however, laboratory data does not support an argillic horizon. Kibler soils have a dark surface that is too thin for an Umbric epipedon. It is anticipated once the current Humudepts/Dystrudepts taxonomy proposal is approved, Kibler soils will be reclassified as Humic Dystrudepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from 8 to 32 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)\nParalithic contact--54 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)\nParalithic materials--32 to 54 inches (Cr layer)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 56 inches"
