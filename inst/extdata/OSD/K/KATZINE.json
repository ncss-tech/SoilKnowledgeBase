Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches in New Mexico and 14 to 20 inches in Arizona with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days."
