  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Katzine soils are on risers of fan terraces, hills and mountains.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from calcareous Tertiary quartz diorite and Jurassic or Triassic sandstones. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches in New Mexico and 14 to 20 inches in Arizona with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days."

Chazner soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to an indurated calcium carbonate hardpan and occur on adjacent treads of fan terraces.  Tsezhin soils have argillic horizons containing over 27 percent clay and occur on treads of fan piedmonts.  Wetherill soils are fine-silty, have argillic horizons and occur on eolian-mantled surfaces."
