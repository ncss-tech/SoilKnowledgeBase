The particle-size control section has greater than 18 percent clay and averages 5 to 20 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe E and Eb horizons have moist hue from 10YR through 5Y, moist value from 3 through 5 and moist chroma from 1 through 3.\nThe Bs and Bsb horizons have moist hue from 2.5YR through 7.5YR, moist value from 3 through 5 and moist chroma from 4 through 6.\nThe 2BC horizon, when present, has moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma from 4 through 6.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue from 10YR through 5Y, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma from 2 through 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 20 percent."

The soils formed in a loess mantle consisting of an admixture of amorphous material of volcanic origin and airborne sediments from broad nonvegetated flood plains.  The loess mantle is underlain by firm, loamy lacustrine andglacial t ll material.  The climate is transitional maritime - continental.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches."
