  "OVERVIEW": "The Kunzler series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. They are on linear and concave parts of fan remnants, fan skirts, inset fans, lake plains, beach plains, and axial stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
