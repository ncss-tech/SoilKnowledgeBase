  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kunzler soils are on linear and concave parts of fan remnants, fan skirts, axial stream terraces, inset fans, lake plains, and beach plains. Slopes are from 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,470 to 2,050 meters. The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks dominated by tuffaceous sandstone, tuff, and limestone. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C. The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

The Hiko Peak soils lack durinodes and brittleness and generally are on convex parts of bajadas. The Mellor soils have natric horizons and a fine silty particle-size control section and are on ephemeral stream flood plains."
