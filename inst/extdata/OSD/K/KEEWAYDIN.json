  "OVERVIEW": "The Keewaydin series consists of very deep, well drained soils on bedrock controlled moraines.  These soils formed in loamy and silty eolian deposits and in the underlying till.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and from 5 to 50 percent in the sandy lower horizons. Cobbles range from 0 to 30 percent throughout the pedon.  Stones range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or the cobbly or bouldery analogues of these textures. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or the cobbly or bouldery analogues of these textures. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bs horizons are fine sandy loam, silt loam, or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction of the Bs horizons is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly analogues of sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid. The 2BC horizon and upper part of the 2C horizon exhibit some characteristics of a fragipan in places.  It is firm when moist and hard when dry and has some brittleness.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is cobbly, gravelly, or very gravelly or very cobbly analogues of sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid. Some pedons have thin pockets or lenses of gravelly sand, gravelly fine sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam."
