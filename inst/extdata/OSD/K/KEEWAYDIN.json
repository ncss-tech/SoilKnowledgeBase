  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the silty or loamy eolian mantle ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 45 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and from 5 to 50 percent in the sandy lower horizons. Cobbles range from 0 to 30 percent throughout the pedon.  Stones range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or the cobbly or bouldery analogues of these textures. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or the cobbly or bouldery analogues of these textures. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bs horizons are fine sandy loam, silt loam, or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction of the Bs horizons is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly analogues of sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid. The 2BC horizon and upper part of the 2C horizon exhibit some characteristics of a fragipan in places.  It is firm when moist and hard when dry and has some brittleness.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is cobbly, gravelly, or very gravelly or very cobbly analogues of sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid. Some pedons have thin pockets or lenses of gravelly sand, gravelly fine sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Allagash, Amasa, Duxbury and Monadnock series. The Allagash soils have less than 15 percent fragments above 40 inches and have hue of 2.5Y or yellower in the BC and 2C horizons.  The Amasa soils have Bhs horizons.  The Duxbury and Monadnock soils are more moist in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice and have hue of 2.5Y or yellower on the 2C horizons.  In addition Duxbury soils contain no fragments greater than 3 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Keewaydin soils are on nearly level to very steep moraines of Wisconsinan Age.  These soils formed in silty or loamy eolian deposits and in the underlying glacial till.  Slopes are predominantly 6 to 45 percent, but range from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 33 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 to 43 degrees F."
