Bodenburg soils do not have substantial mica content in the control section. Fairless soils do not have thin fine textured lamellae in parts of the solum. Fairbanks soils have less than 15 percent fine sands and coarser in the substratum. Nunaniq soils are presumed to have warmer soil temperatures. Toghotthele soils have calcium carbonate in the substratum."
