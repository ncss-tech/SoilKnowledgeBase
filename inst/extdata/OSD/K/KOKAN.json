  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kokan soils are on rolling to steep sides and/or narrow crests of ridges and faces of piedmonts and fan terraces at elevations of about 1,760 to 5,600 feet. Slope gradients are dominantly between 20 to 35 percent and range from 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in very gravelly and sandy alluvium derived from granite, rhyolite, andesite, gneiss, limestone, sandstone, and shale. The climate is arid. Annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 12 inches which falls mainly during the summer."
