  "OVERVIEW": "The Konza series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess over colluvium on uplands. Konza soils are on open depressions on hillslopes on uplands in the Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 840 millimeters (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), at the type location.",

(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: the zone from the 0 to 71 centimeters (0 to 28 inches). (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: the zone from 15 to 200 centimeters (6 to 80 inches). (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, Btk2, 2Btn1, 2Btn2, and 2Btn3 horizons).\nSecondary carbonates: the zone from 71 to 127 centimeters (28 to 50 inches). (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons)\nSalt accumulations: the zone from 127 to 200 centimeters (50 to 80 inches). (2Btn1, 2Btn2, and 2Btn3 horizons)\nRedoximorphic features: the zone from 71 to 200 centimeters (28 to 80 inches). (Btk1, Btk2, 2Btn1, 2Btn2, and 2Btn3 horizons)\nThese soils were formerly mapped as Dwight and Irwin soils. Dwight soils have a natric horizon, the Konza soils do not. Irwin soils have a surface layer greater than 8 inches thick.\n06/2003 Horizon nomenclature corrected the \"b\" was removed as these soils have a welded paleosol and not a buried soil.\n4/2017 BKN updated introduction and added on an east-facing, linear, 1 percent slope summit in rangeland at an elevation of 433 meters (1420 feet) to typical pedon. Updated to metric. Added lab sample numbers. Added redox features to horizon descriptions for Btk1, Btk2, 2Btn1, 2Btn2, and 2Btn3 horizons. Removed Bt3 horizon as it is not commonly seen in the field nor is it present at the type location. Added n to the nomenclature for the horizons from the second parent material as lab data supports significant salt accumulations in these horizons. Added soil moisture, soil temperature, MAST, PSCS, clay, sand, depth to bedrock, secondary carbonates, redox, and thickness of the argillic to the RIC. Added clay and sand to horizon RIC. Updated SAR. Added Btk horizon in RIC. Changed geographic setting to tabular. Added elevation, precipitation pattern and FFD to geographic setting. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity. Updated distribution and extend to meet standards. Added PSCS, carbonates, redox, and salts to remarks.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth Edition, 2014."
