  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 90 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The soil has  more than 90 percent calcium carbonate in the marl layers.  The soil has less than 10 percent by volume of gravel size fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where value is 4 or 5, chroma is 1.  Texture is marl with a noncarbonate free texture of silt or silt loam.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Fiber content is 20 to 50 percent unrubbed and less than 10 percent rubbed.  Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline in calcium chloride.\nThe A/Oa horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline. It is 60 to 70 percent marl(A) and 30 to 40 percent muck(Oa).  The A portion has the same ranges of color and texture as the A horizon.  The Oa portion has the same ranges of color and texture as the Oa horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is marl with a non-carbonate free texture of silt or silt loam.  In some pedons, the Cg horizon is stratified marl and sand size shell fragment.\nThe 2R horizon is soft to hard but rippable coral or oolitic limestone."
