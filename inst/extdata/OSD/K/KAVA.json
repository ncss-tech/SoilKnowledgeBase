  "OVERVIEW": "The Kava series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from Mancos Shale.  Kava soils are on, fan piedmonts and knobs.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
