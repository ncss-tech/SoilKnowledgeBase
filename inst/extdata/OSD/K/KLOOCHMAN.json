  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be 43 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 75 days following summer solstice.  Depth to a lithic contact with gneiss or schist is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 10 to 25 percent coarse fragments and 0 to 10 percent weathered rock fragments.  The mantle of volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The lower part of the control section averages 35 to 65 percent coarse fragments and 0 to 20 percent weathered rock fragments.  Some pedons have a flaggy surface layer.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Texture is gravelly fine sandy loam cobbly sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Texture is very channery loamy sand, extremely flaggy sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

Belzar soils are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and effervescent in the 2C horizon within the particle-size control section.  Bertolotti, Cliffdell, Highhorn, Inkler, McCree, Newbell, Ohscow, Scotties, Sugarbowl, Talls, Threemile, and Wilmont soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Hartill soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Huntrock soils are 27 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction or the 2Bw.  Illabot soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Oxerine soils have less than 50 percent sand in the volcanic ash mantle, with apparent field textures of loam or silt loam.  Wilma soils are dominated by granitic pebbles in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from gneiss or schist and volcanic ash.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F. The mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 140 days.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 130 to 160 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from 1 to 4 inches, a cambic horizon from 4 to 19 inches, and a lithic contact at 35 inches.  Separation with the competing Oxerine series needs further study.\nDiagnostic horizons and features are measured from the to of the first mineral horizon.\nClasification was changed 1/00 based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy from Andic Xerochrepts to Andic Haploxerepts.\nMore investigation is needed on this series to determine if the upper 18 inches qualifies for andic soil properties and a Vitrixerands classification.\nThe mineralogy is based on the thickest part of the particle-size control section.  If this pedon is an Andisol, an ashy over loamy-skeletal, glassy over mixed would be in order.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
