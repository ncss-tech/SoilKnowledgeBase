    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kegel soils are on bottom lands incised by intermittent or perennial streams at elevations of 750 to 1,225 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in recent alluvium derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks and volcanic ash. These soils are in a continental climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C. The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 900 mm."
