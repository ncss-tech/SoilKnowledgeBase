  "OVERVIEW": "The Kegel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium of mixed mineralogy. Kegel soils are in narrow stream flood plains, alluvial fans, and depressions. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 675 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
