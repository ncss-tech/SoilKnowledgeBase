Meeteetse soils are calcareous at or near the surface and have a moderate amount of gypsum in the lower part of the argillic and the C horizon. Ultra soils have the base of the natric horizon at 18 to 33 cm. Uvada soils are calcareous throughout and have a silty clay loam or silty clay natric horizon."
