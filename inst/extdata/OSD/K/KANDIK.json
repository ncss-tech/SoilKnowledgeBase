  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Color of matrix ranges from dark grayish brown to grayish brown and olive gray.  Streaks and patches range in hue from 7.5YR to 5Y, in value from 4 to 5, and in chroma from 2 to 6.  A brownish incipient B horizon occurs in some pedons, indicating an intergrade to the Rampart soils."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Bodenburg and Takotna series of the same subgroup, the Kotsina and Kaltag series of the same great group, and the Minto and Rampart series.  The Bodenburg soils are not calcareous, have somewhat lower matrix chromas, and contain a buried spodic horizon.  The Takotna soils have sandy strata in the subsoil.  The Kotsina soils have buried lenses and pockets of organic matter.  The Kaltag soils are not calcareous.  The Minto soils are micaceous and noncalcareous, and have mottles indicative of impeded drainage. The Rampart soils have weak brown B horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kandik soils occur on gently to strongly sloping uplands bordering portions of the Yukon River.  They have formed in fairly thick calcareous loess.  The climate is subarctic continental, with long cold winters and short warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is commonly less than 14 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include, in addition to the Rampart soils, the Easley and Yukon soils.  The Easley soils are poorly drained and have high permafrost tables.  The Yukon soils are somewhat poorly drained stratified soils with permafrost."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Largely in forest.  The principal trees are white spruce and paper birch.  Willows and alder occur in the understory, and are the principal vegetation in areas that have been severely burned."

    "section": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT",
    "content": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils have been observed only along the upper Yukon River in east central Alaska.  They are probably moderately extensive along major rivers in that area."
