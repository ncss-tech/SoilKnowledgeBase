  "OVERVIEW": "The Kitipes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Kitipes soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
