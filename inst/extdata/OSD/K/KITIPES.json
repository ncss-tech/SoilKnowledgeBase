Abra soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13.3 to 14.4 degrees C.  Bighams, Creel and Xenmack soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Bowdish and Molen soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Copeman and Kimera soils have peak periods of precipitation in April through June.  Darvey soils are 24 to 35 inches deep to the calcic horizon.  Hernandez is presumed to have basalt rock fragments.  Honlu and Peachsprings soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Numa soils have a man-made thickened Ap horizon from long periods of irrigation."
