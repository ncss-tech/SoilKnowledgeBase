The mean annual soil temperature is typically 52 to 57 degrees F.  but may range to 49 degrees F. (minimum).   The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick.  Rock fragments of partially weathered sedimentary, metasedimentary, or volcanic rocks range from 50 to 80 percent in the control section.  The amount increases with increasing depth.  Depth to soft bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It  has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, or very gravelly clay loam with 22 to 30 percent clay.  It has  35 to 55 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles.  A few pedons have few faint to distinct clay films in the lower horizons.  Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon, where present, has 60 to 95 percent rock fragments and is loam."

The Atring, Beekman, Clallam, Geppert, Inskip, Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron, Straight, Vena and Woodin soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Baldhill soils have 2 to 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days during the summer.  Barpeak soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Chamate and Hartless soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are dry for over 60 consecutive days during the summer.  Kindig soils are dry for 80 to 100 consecutive days during the summer and contain slight to moderate amounts of finely divided mica.  Terbies soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 49 degrees F. and have a Bs horizon. Farber soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kanid soils are on mountain side slopes, dissected drainageways, and foot slopes.  Slopes are 12 to 90 percent.  Elevations are 300 to 4,100 feet.  Kanid soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary, metasedimentary, and metavolcanic rocks. The climate is characterized by cool and moist to wet winters and warm to hot dry summers.  The mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F; the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 60 inches but in areas of high winter rainfall may range to 100 inches. The frost-free period is 100 to 235 days."
