The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.   The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the Bt horizon.  The particle-size control section contains 30 to 50 percent clay with the weighted average being more than 35 percent.  It has 10 to 40 percent cobbles and 20 to 40 percent gravel with the weighted average being more than 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 30 percent cobbles and 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam and has 30 to 40 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 20 to 30 percent gravel.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kahneeta soils are in concave or depressional scabland areas on outwash plains.  The soil formed in alluvium and glacial outwash with an influence of loess in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 2600 to 3000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Skooker soils are on adjacent forested outwash plains, are loamy-skeletal, well drained and lack a duripan.  Tenwalter soils are on intermound scabland areas of outwash plains, well drained and shallow to a duripan.  Tolius soils are on adjacent forested outwash plains, fine-loamy, well drained and lack a duripan."
