  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F. The soils are usually moist and they are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches following the summer solstice. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F under canopy cover. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The solum ranges from 40 to 70 inches thick. Soil reaction ranges from strongly through extremely acid. Coarse fragments are generally lacking above depth of 40 inches but the lower part of the control section contains as much as 15 percent by volume. The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and may include part of the upper Bw horizon.  The upper 5 to 13 inches has an estimated Alox +  Feox of 2.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc.  The lower 10 to 25 inches has an estimated Alox +  Feox of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc.  Andic soil properties, when present, do not extend beyond a depth of 14 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is medial silt loam in the upper part and medial silt loam or silt loam in the lower part with 18 to 25 percent clay by field estimates.  It has 8 to 12 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw1 and Bw2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam with 22 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 10 percent rounded paragravel.\nThe Bw3 horizon and the BC or C horizons, when present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, paragravelly silty clay loam, or paragravelly silty loam.  It has 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 35 percent rounded paragravel.  Paragravelly textures occur below a depth of 40 inches.  In some areas sandy and gravelly substrata are below a depth of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ecola, Templeton, and Walluski series.  Ecola soils have an umbric epipedon dominantly 14 to 20 inches thick although it ranges to 25 inches, and is 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Templeton soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and when present, has subangular shaped rock and pararock fragments of colluvial origin.  Walluski soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 24 to 40 inches."

The soil formed in moderately fine-textured alluvium underlain by stratified alluvium at depths of more than 40 inches. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual temperature is about 49 to 53 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 42 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F. The mean frost-free period is 145 to 300 days. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches."

Chitwood soils are somewhat poorly drained, fine textured and occur in slightly concave areas.  Hebo soils are poorly drained, fine textured and occur in swales and concave areas.  Walluski soils are moderately well drained and occur in nearly level to slightly concave areas."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
