  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact of fractured and weathered andesitic rock is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 51 degrees to 57 degrees F., and usually is below 41 degrees F., from December 15 to March 15. The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually dry in all parts from July 15 until October 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. It is moist in all parts from December 15 to April 15. Rock fragments make up 5 to 30 percent of the soil. Fragments are both angular and rounded and are mostly pebbles with a few cobbles and stones. The soil is slightly acid to mildly alkaline. In some pedons, the lower B horizon is slightly or strongly effervescent. The soil has cracks 1 to 2 cm wide from the surface to a depth of 20 inches or more when dry in the summer. Very few nonintersecting slickensides are in some pedons. There is little or no mixing or churning of the horizons. Organic carbon ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 percent at depths of 16 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon ranges from dark brown to black (lOYR 3/3, 3/2, 3/1, 2/2, 2/1). Moist colors are dark brown, very dark grayish brown, or very dark brown (lOYR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3). It is clay loam, or silty clay loam with about 27 to 35 percent clay content.\nThe B2t horizon is grayish brown and brown to dark gray (lOYR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, 4/1i 7.5YR 5/2, 4/2). Moist colors are brown to very dark brown (lOYR 4/3, 4/2, 3/3, 3/2, 2/2; 7.5YR 4/2, 3/2). It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay content. The clay content gradually increases from the A horizon to the Bt horizon and has at least 8 percent increase in clay content."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Forsgren, Montour and Ukiah series.  Forsgren soils have secondary carbonates below 40 inches in the lower B2t horizon and are deeper than 60 inches. Montour soils lack a paralithic or lithic contact and have a Cca horizon. Ukiah soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have mean annual soil temperatures of 47 to 51 F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kuck soils are on uplands. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and material weathered from andesite, tuff, basalt or conglomerates. The rock is slightly to strongly weathered and fractured. This soil is often associated with cobbles and stones on the surface and with rock outcrops. Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet. The climate is continental and subhumid with warm to hot dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches. Seasonal snowfall is 8 to 36 inches. Mean January temperature is 28 degrees to 34 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 66 degrees to 72 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. Frost-free season s 100 to 140 days."

Jenny, Lassen and Montague soils are clayey and have intersecting slickensides. Pit soils are somewhat poorly and poorly drained, clayey and have intersecting slickensides."

The native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass and a few western Juniper and black oak. Many areas consist of medusa head, rye grass and rabbitbrush. A few pine trees are where the rainfall is near 20 inches."
