  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 10 to 26 inches and soil depth is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The difference between the average winter and average summer soil temperature is 25 to 30 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 21 inches is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to March 30.  Organic matter content is assumed to be 1 to 3 percent from the surface to a depth of 10 to 19 inches and is less than 1 percent below that.  Organic matter content decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline and base saturation, ammonium acetate, is 60 to 90 percent throughout.  The particle-size control section is 7 to 18 percent clay and is greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragment content averages 0 to 15 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, or 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, or 4/4.  It is stratified very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content is 0 to 25 percent."
