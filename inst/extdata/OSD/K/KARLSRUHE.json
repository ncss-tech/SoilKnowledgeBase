The average texture of the particle-size control section typically is loamy coarse sand or coarse sand, but, in some pedons it is loamy sand or sand with appreciable amounts of coarse sand.  It has more than 30 percent medium and coarser sand.  The A and Bk horizons contain up to 10 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam or loamy sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 8.
