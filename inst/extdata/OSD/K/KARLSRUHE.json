  "OVERVIEW": "The Karlsruhe series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on outwash plains, delta plains and in outwash channels.  Slope ranges from of 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 17 inches.",
