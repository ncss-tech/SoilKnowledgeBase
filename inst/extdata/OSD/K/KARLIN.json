  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise stated depth ranges in the following paragraphs are measured from the mineral surface. The thickness of the solum typically is 22 to 36 inches, but ranges from 15 to 40 inches. The solum ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid, but in some pedons it is extremely acid.  Gravel and cobble content ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon. Stones covering the surface range from less than 0.01 to 0.1 percent.\nWhere present the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  An A horizon is present in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and E horizons are loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  The Bs horizon is dominantly loamy fine sand but the range includes fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Some pedons have a Bhs horizon with value and chroma of 3 less than 3 inches. The BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is typically sand. Some pedons have bright mottles below a depth of 40 inches. The C horizon is strongly acid to neutral."

Duel and Ishpeming soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches.  East Lake soils have a calcareous substratum.  Hartwick, Kiva and Sayner soils range from between 15 and 35 percent gravel within the 10 to 40 inch control section.    Rousseau, Rubicon and Vilas soils contain more than 85 percent sand throughout the solum.  Sultz soils have stratification in the lower part of the series control section."
