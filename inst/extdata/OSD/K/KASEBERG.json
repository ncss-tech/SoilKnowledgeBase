  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaseberg series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material weathered from consolidated sediments of mixed rock sources.  Kaseberg soils are on nearly level to rolling sloping low-lying terraces and hill slopes of dissected terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees at any time.  The soil below the depth of 7 inches is dry in all parts from June to Oct 15 and is moist in all parts from November to May.  Soil textures are fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with less than 3 percent clay increase anywhere in the profile.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2; 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4.\nThe Bw horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 6/2, 6/4; 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4. Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 4/3, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4.\nThe C horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 5/4, 4/4.  Some pedons do not have a C horizon.\nThe Cqm or Bqm horizon is composed of 1 or more colors.
