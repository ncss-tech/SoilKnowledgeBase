    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a duripan capping the bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  A paralithic contact immediately underlies the duripan.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees at any time.  The soil below the depth of 7 inches is dry in all parts from June to Oct 15 and is moist in all parts from November to May.  Soil textures are fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with less than 3 percent clay increase anywhere in the profile.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2; 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4.\nThe Bw horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 6/2, 6/4; 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4. Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 4/3, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4.\nThe C horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 5/4, 4/4.  Some pedons do not have a C horizon.\nThe Cqm or Bqm horizon is composed of 1 or more colors.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in material weathered from consolidated sandstone and siltstone of the Fair Oaks or Laguna Formations.  Some strata of volcanic glass are present.  Elevations are 75 to 270 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F; average January temperature is 45 degrees F, average July temperature is 81 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 250 to 300 days."

Cometa soils have an argillic horizon and lack a duripan.  Fiddyment have an argillic horizon and a duripan between 20 to 37 inches.  San Joaquin soils have an argillic horizon, a hardpan at 20 to 40 inches, lack siltstone below the hardpan and are on low terraces; Cometa and Fiddyment soils are on similar landscape positions."
