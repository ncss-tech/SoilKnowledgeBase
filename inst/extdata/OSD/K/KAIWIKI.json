Follow the winding paved road west.  At approximately 1.75 miles the pavement ends.  Follow the rock cane haul road through the pastures to the forest line and park.  You will be at the edge of Kawainui stream. Follow the hunters trail along the Kawainui stream 0.5 miles to stream fork.

Akaka soils are moderately well drained with redox features in A and Bw horizons and Bs horizons.  Honokaa, Maile, and Moaula soils have a udic soil moisture regime. Honomanu and Kehena soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 39 inches) deep.  Ohia soils are on younger Mauna Loa flows and are slightly smeary in the A horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kaiwiki soils are on ashfields that are on mid-elevation windward slopes of Mauna Kea volcano at elevations of 335 to 1615 meters (1100 to 5300 feet).  The soils formed in material weathered from volcanic ash underlain by 100-300 thousand year old pahoehoe and `a`a lava flows.  Kaiwiki soils are typically found on the summit, shoulder or backslope of the hillslope profile.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent but can be as high as 100 percent in gulch areas.  Mean annual precipitation is 5000 to over 6000 mm (200 to over 240 inches).  The mean annual temperature is 15 to 21 degrees C. (59 to 70 degrees F.).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
