The soils formed in material weathered from volcanic ash underlain by 100-300 thousand year old pahoehoe and `a`a lava flows.  Kaiwiki soils are typically found on the summit, shoulder or backslope of the hillslope profile.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent but can be as high as 100 percent in gulch areas.  Mean annual precipitation is 5000 to over 6000 mm (200 to over 240 inches).  The mean annual temperature is 15 to 21 degrees C. (59 to 70 degrees F.).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
