  "OVERVIEW": "The Keigley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from shale and limestone.  Keigley soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The soils are moderately alkaline or strong alkaline.  The particle-size control section is silty clay loam or clay loam containing 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4."
