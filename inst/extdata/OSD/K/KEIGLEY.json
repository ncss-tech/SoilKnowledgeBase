The soils are moderately alkaline or strong alkaline.  The particle-size control section is silty clay loam or clay loam containing 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4."

They formed in mixed alluvium mainly from shale and limestone.  The climate is dry subhumid with mean annual temperature of 45 to 56 degrees F., a mean summer temperature of 70 degrees F., and average annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 170 days."
