  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 10 to 22 inches in over 60 percent of the pedon.  The solum thickness is greater than 50 inches.  Typically, the boundary between the A or E and B horizon is abrupt but ranges to clear.  COLE ranges from 0.07 to 0.10 in the B horizons and PLE ranges from 4 to 6 cm in the upper 1 meter of the soil.\nThe A and Ap horizons have a hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3.  When the value is 3, the thickness is less than 7 inches.  The texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe E horizon, where it exists, has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of red, yellow or brown range from none to common.  The texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Btg horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from few to many.  The texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Pitted concretions of calcium carbonate range from none to few within the control section and range to common below the control section.  Reaction is strongly acid through mildly alkaline in the control section and ranges to moderately alkaline in some pedons below the control section and may have a calcareous matrix.\nThe C and 2C horizon, where it occurs, has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Mottles in shades of yellow and brown range from none to many.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, clay, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have few to common pitted concretions of calcium carbonate.  The reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline and noncalcareous."

Alusa, Edna, and Meikle soils have A horizons that averages less than 10 inches thick.  Arol, Corrigan, Falba, and Leaksville soils have solums less than 40 inches thick.  Cherokee soils have mixed mineralogy.  Crowley soils have more than 50 percent silt in the control section.  Forestdale soils lack an abrupt textural change from the A or E to the B.  Inez and Telferner soils have temperatures above 72 degrees F.  Meggett soils have mixed mineralogy.  Wrightsville soils have tongues of glossic materials into a B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kemah soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping uplands on slightly convex positions.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  Few circular mounds about 10 to 30 feet in diameter and 6 to 12 inches high occur in some places.  The parent material is fluvial sediments of the Beaumont Formation which was deposited during the Pleistocene age.  At the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F. and the average annual rainfall is about 45 inches.  The Thornthwaite P-E index is 56 to 76."
