  "OVERVIEW": "The Knifehill series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Knifehill soils are on stream terraces on valley floors and fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
