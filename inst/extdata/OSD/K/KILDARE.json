  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.  The Jasco, Henry, Mashulaville, Olive, Olivier, and Thage series are in closely related families. Henry soils have mixed mineralogy, formed in loess, and contain more silt and less very-fine and fine sand.  Jasco soils are in a coarse-silty particle size family and have higher base status in the lower part. Mashulaville and Olive soils are in a coarse-loamy family. Olivier soils are better drained, and formed in loess. Thage soils are better drained and have higher base status in the lower part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kildare soils are in closed depressional areas on uplands. These soils formed in loamy and silty sediments on stream and marine terraces. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 55 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 63 degrees to 67 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 270 days. Elevation ranges from 225 to 275. Thornthwaite P-E indices exceed 64."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Erno, Metcalf, Mollville, Wrightsville and Gallime Soils. Erno and Gallime soils are moderately well drained and on higher landscape positions, and do not have a fragipan or a natric horizon. Metcalf, soils are in slightly higher or intermound  positions in the landscape and do not have a fragipan or a natric horizon.  Mollville and Wrightsville are on similar landscape positions to Kildare soils, but do not have a fragipan or a natric horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Kildare soils are very poorly drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is negligible. A perched saturated zone is above the fragipan and at or near the surface during November through April in normal years. Some areas are subject to occasional ponding for long duration. An apparent water table is present below the fragipan for 4 to 10 months of most years."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for forest and wildlife. Native vegetation is sedges and rushes, water tolerant hardwoods and a few scattered shortleaf and loblolly pine.  Growth rates are so slow that the soil is unsuited for commercial production of wood."
