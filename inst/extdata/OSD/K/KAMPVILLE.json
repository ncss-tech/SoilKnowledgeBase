    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Concord, Elbert, McGirk, Sexton, and Traer series.  Concord soils have a distinct lithologic discontinuity, have a less acid solum, and have an average annual temperature of less than 54 degrees F.  Elbert soils have bedrock from 40 to 60 inches.  McGirk soils average less than 5 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Sexton soils have a lithologic discontinuity.  Traer soils have an average annual temperature of less than 54 degrees F, and are less acid in the lower part of the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kampville soils are on nearly level flood plains.  The slope is 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in acid alluvium from the Mississippi River and its tributaries.  The mean annual temperature varies from 54 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation varies from 33 to 43 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carlow, Chequest, Hurst, and Portage soils.  Carlow and Portage soils contain more clay and are on lower slack water positions or old stream channels. Chequest soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower areas on the floodplain. Hurst soils have browner upper B horizons and are on terraces along major streams that drain into the Mississippi River."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is slow.  In undisturbed areas there is an apparent water table with an upper limit of 0 to 1.0 feet at sometime from November to April.  Most areas are subject to occasional flooding."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Almost all areas of Kampville soils are cultivated.   Corn, soybeans, and wheat are the principal crops.  Some areas are flooded in the late fall and winter to provide habitat for wetland wildlife.  Native vegetation is mainly willow, cottonwood, and marsh grasses."
