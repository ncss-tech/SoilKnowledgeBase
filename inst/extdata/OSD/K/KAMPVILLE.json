Concord soils have a distinct lithologic discontinuity, have a less acid solum, and have an average annual temperature of less than 54 degrees F.  Elbert soils have bedrock from 40 to 60 inches.  McGirk soils average less than 5 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Sexton soils have a lithologic discontinuity.

Carlow and Portage soils contain more clay and are on lower slack water positions or old stream channels. Chequest soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower areas on the floodplain. Hurst soils have browner upper B horizons and are on terraces along major streams that drain into the Mississippi River."
