The rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A E, and Bt horizons, and 0 to 50 percent in the C or 2C horizon.  Some pedons have a 2Bt2 horizon with rock fragment content ranging from 15 to 35 percent. The rock fragments are mixed in lithology.  Clay content of the particle-size control section (weighted average) ranges from 5 to 18 percent.  Sand content of the particle-size control section (weighted average) ranges from 50 to 78 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper part and ranges from 65 to 95 percent fine sand and coarser in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon that is 13 to 25 centimeters thick.  It has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from 4.5 to 7.3. This horizon ranges from 5 to 15 centimeters thick.\nThe E horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is a loamy sand, sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from 4.5 to 7.3.  This horizon ranges from 0 to 30 centimeters thick.\nThe Bt horizon and 2Bt horizon, where present, have a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in all or part of these horizons.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It includes gravelly analogue textures in the lower part.  It includes sandy clay loam in subhorizons of some pedons.  They have few to common clay films on faces of peds and clay bridges between sand grains. Few to common thin coatings of E horizon material are on faces of peds in these horizons in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from 6.1 to 7.8.  This horizon ranges from 12 to 45 centimeters thick.\nSome pedons have a Bk or 2Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has a matrix hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Iron concentrations with chroma higher than the matrix are in part to all of these horizons.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or their gravelly and very gravelly analogues. This horizon is typically stratified.  Reaction ranges from 7.4 to 8.4."
