  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kilmanagh series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. Kilmanagh soils formed in loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
