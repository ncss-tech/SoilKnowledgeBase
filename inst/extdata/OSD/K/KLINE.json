    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  By weighted average the control section has 45 to 75 percent rounded pebbles and cobbles.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.\nSome pedons have B horizons.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, and 5 or 6 dry.  The fine earth fraction is sandy loam or loam.  It has 15 to 60 percent pebbles and cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  The fine earth fraction is sand or loamy sand with thin strata of sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has 50 to 90 percent pebbles and cobbles.  Strata of sandy loam or very fine sandy loam 10 to 30 inches thick occur below the control section in some pedons."

Kline soils are in a marine climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 210 days."

Barneston soils lack an irregular decrease in organic carbon and are influenced by volcanic ash in the upper part.  Briscot, Oridia, and Sumas soils have an aquic moisture regime and are not skeletal.  Squalicum soils are medial.  Whatcom soils are medial over loamy."
