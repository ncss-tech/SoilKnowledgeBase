  "OVERVIEW": "The Ketchly series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed ash and loess over colluvium weathered from andesite.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years in all parts of the control section.  The upper 6 to 12 inches is estimated to have a moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.20 g/cc, a volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  Base saturation is assumed to be less than 75 percent in some part of the argillic horizon and within 30 inches of the surface.  The solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches thick and the depth to basalt and andesite ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  Hue of the solum is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon has 3 to 15 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent shot 1 to 3 mm in diameter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is heavy loam or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay, more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and 0 to 30 percent gravel.  This horizon has weak or moderate medium to coarse subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2C horizon is very cobbly clay loam or stony loam and has 25 to 50 percent rock fragments, mostly cobbles and stones."

Hard soils have an ochric epipedon, an E horizon, and are moderately well drained with aquic conditions at a depth of 20 to 35 inches.  Panak soils have an ochric epipedon and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Soils with a similar classification have mixed mineralogy include the Kruse, McEwen, and Seddow series.  Kruse soils have an ochric epipedon and have rock fragments derived from granite, gneiss, or mica schist origin.  McEwen soils have an ochric epipedon and are 40 to 60 inches to stratified very or extremely gravelly alluvium.  Seddow soils have an ochric epipedon, a B/E horizon, and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice."

The soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with loess over stony moderately fine textured colluvium weathered from andesite.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The average July temperature is 60 degrees F.;  the average January temperature is 30 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches. The frost free period is 70 to 120 days."
