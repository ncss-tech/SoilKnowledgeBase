  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The sandy mantle contains 0 to 5 percent rock fragments, that are mostly less than 5 millimeters in diameter. The depth to carbonates is greater than 60 inches. The depth to loamy sediments is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon (when present) is as much as 8 inches thick. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam. Thin subhorizons or strata of fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand or loam commonly occur. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2C or 2Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or very fine sandy loam. Thin strata or subhorizons of loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam or loam commonly occur. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Keenan soils are on convex to linear surfaces of glacial lake plains. Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent. They formed in eolian sand, outwash or glaciolacustrine sand and underlying glaciolacustrine loamy sediments. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days. Elevation is 1250 to 1400 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barber, Kapla, Vasso, Wabuse, and Westoo series. The somewhat poorly drained Vasso, poorly drained Wabuse and very poorly drained Kapla soils form a hydrosequence with the Keenan soils. Somewhat poorly drained Barber, and moderately well drained Westoo soils do not have loamy material in the lower part of the series control section."
