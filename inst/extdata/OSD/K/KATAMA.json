  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 23 to 42 inches. Rounded gravel of mixed mineralogy is usually less than 15 percent except in the Bw horizon where it ranges to 50 percent.  About half of the rock fragments are less than 1/4 inch diameter.  Sand grains in the AB, Bw, and 2Bw are coated and bridged with material that, when moist, looks like colloidal films and bridges.  This material is black (5YR 2/1) or dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2 and 3/2) when moist.  On drying it looses its colloidal appearance and its color changes to brown (10YR 4/3 and 5/3).  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 0 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Clean white quartz sand grains range from 20 to 50 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  The 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in the same family.\nOther soils in related families include Carver, Eastchop, Evesboro, Klej, Pompton, and Riverhead.  All of these soils have ochric epipedons.  In addition, Eastchop, Evesboro, and Klej soils have more than 90 percent resistant minerals.  Pompton and Riverhead soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Katama soils are on broad nearly level to gently sloping outwash plains.  They are adjacent to the ocean and 10 to 20 feet above sea level.  Slope commonly is 0 to 3 percent, but ranges to 8 percent.  The soils developed in sandy outwash that in many places has been reworked by wind.  The climate is oceanic and dense sea fogs are very common.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 180 to more than 200 days."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately high to very high in the substratum. Runoff is negligible or low."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most Katama soils are idle or are in native grassland.  Native vegetation consists of lichens, trailing arbutus, bearberry, bluestem, poverty grass, and scattered, dwarfed specimens of bayberry, pitch pine, and scrub oak."
