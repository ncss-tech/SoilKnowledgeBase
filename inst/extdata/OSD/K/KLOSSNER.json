  "OVERVIEW": "The Klossner series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in well decomposed organic material  overlying loamy or silty lacustrine deposits, slope alluvium, or till. These soils are depressions on moraines, till plains, lake plains, flood plains, and seeps. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 585 to 930 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

This concept is in the aquic moisture regime.\nKlossner was formerly included in the Palms Series in Minnesota.
