  "OVERVIEW": "The Kerl series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial material and alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
