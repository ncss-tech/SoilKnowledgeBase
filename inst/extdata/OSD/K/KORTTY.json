    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kortty soils are on summits of fan remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,485 to 1,650 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
