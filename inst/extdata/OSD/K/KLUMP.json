Chickasha, Ravia, Teller, and Zaneis soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition Chickasha soils have yellower hues.  Ravia soils have sola 40 to 60 inches over materials weathered from granite.  Zaneis soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick over thinly bedded sandstone and shale. Cuero soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches and have mixed mineralogy.  Frankirk soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Knolle soils lack mollic epipedons.  Willacy soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F."
