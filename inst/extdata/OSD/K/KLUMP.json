The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values 3 to 5, and chromas of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam or loamy sand but includes fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles of yellowish brown and dark red range from none to common.  It contains common ped coatings of dark brown or brown. Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam with clay content ranging from 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

Coyle soils have sola 20 to 40 inches thick.  Groesbeck soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Albion soils have less than 18 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Chickasha, Ravia, Teller, and Zaneis soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition Chickasha soils have yellower hues.  Ravia soils have sola 40 to 60 inches over materials weathered from granite.  Zaneis soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick over thinly bedded sandstone and shale. Cuero soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches and have mixed mineralogy.  Frankirk soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Knolle soils lack mollic epipedons.  Willacy soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F."

Slopes are mainly 4 to 7 percent but range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 200 to 550 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 48 to 64."
