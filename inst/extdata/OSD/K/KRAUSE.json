  "OVERVIEW": "The Krause series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over alluvium. Krause soils are on stream terraces, escarpments and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
