  "OVERVIEW": "The Kuykendall series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from basalt and other related volcanic rocks. Kuykendall soils are on hills and mountains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
