  "OVERVIEW": "The Kapapala series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash deposited over pahoehoe lava.  Kapapala soils are on ashfields and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 1524 millimeters (60 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F.).",
