Antrobus soils are calcareous throughout and have 20  to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Basinpeak and  Handran soils lack a cambic horizon.  Broad Canyon soils have very stony  or very gravelly loamy sand at 24 to 40 inches and are slightly or  moderately acid.  Decram, Foxmount, Grafen, Krackle, Middlehill,  Parachute, Rockabin, and Supervisor soils are moderately deep.  Fairydell and Silvercliff soils have a calcic horizon.  Farlow soils  have calcium carbonate at 6 to 20 inches.  Gaia soils have lamellae and  lack a cambic horizon.  Greyback and Teemat soils have calcium carbonate  at 7 to 15 inches.  Kamack soils have an O horizon and receive 25 to 30  inches of precipitation.  Lag soils have summer soil temperature of 45  to 47 degrees F., have an O horizon and support a forest plant  community.  Maurice soils have average annual soil temperature of 43 to  47 degrees F.  McCort soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bw horizon.  Midelight soils are deep and have a Bk horizon that is moderately or  strongly alkaline.  Midfork soils lack a Bw horizon and have calcium  carbonate at 4 to 15 inches.  Sebud soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in  the particle-size control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klug soils are on foothills and mountain sides and have slopes of  5 to 70 percent.  Elevations are 4,300 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from quartzite, slate and granitic material.  The climate is cold  and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer.  Average  annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 22 inches. Average summer air  temperature is 53 to 60 degrees F, and the average annual air  temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 10 to 60 days."
