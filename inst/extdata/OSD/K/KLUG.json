  "OVERVIEW": "The Klug series consists of very deep, well drained, soils on foothills and mountains.  They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from quartzite, slate and granite.  Permeability is moderate or  moderately rapid.  Slopes are  5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual  precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature  is about 37 degrees F.",
