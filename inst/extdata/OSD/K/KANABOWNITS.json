  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanabownits series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from cherty limestone and sandstone. Kanabownits soils are on summits and shoulders of hills and ridges on plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
