    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to carbonates range from 40 to 80 inches. The weighted average clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 20 to 50 percent in the particle-size control section. Rock fragments are a mixture of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. The sedimentary rocks are mostly dolomite. Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 10 percent throughout the soil and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed or where fire has created ash. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and is slightly or moderately alkaline in the substratum. Redoximorphic concentrations occur within 40 inches. Saturation occurs at 30 to 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in normal years.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Typically, texture is fine sandy loam or loam, but in some pedons it is sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Typically, texture is fine sandy loam or loam, but in some pedons it is sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nKeshena soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam or loam."
