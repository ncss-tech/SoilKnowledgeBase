  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kettle series consists of deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from arkose deposits.  Kettle soils are on alluvial fans, till plains, valley side slopes or hills and ridges and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
