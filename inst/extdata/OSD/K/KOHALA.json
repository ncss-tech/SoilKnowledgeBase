These soils are on all hillslope positions of gently sloping to steep lava flows that are 750,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over residuum from basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1020 to 1520 millimeters (40 to 60 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2,286 to 2,540 meters (90 to 100 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 76 degrees F) average January temperature is 69 degrees F.; average July temperature is 75 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
