  "OVERVIEW": "The Kegler series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments partially reworked by wind.  Kegler soils are on low lake terraces at the margins of basins.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
