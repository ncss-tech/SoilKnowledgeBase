The soil moisture control section is dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to an indurated duripan is 25 to 40 inches.  The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 20 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe A and BA horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Structure in some pedons is single grained.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist or dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has values of 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."
