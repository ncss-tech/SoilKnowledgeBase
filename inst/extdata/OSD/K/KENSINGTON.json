  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adelphia, Bigpool, Blairton, Holmdel, Manokin (T), Trackler, Wharton, Whiteside, and Woodstown series. Adelphia soils formed in glauconite bearing eolian and/or fluviomarine deposits. Bigpool soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Blairton soils formed in residuum from gray shale and are moderately deep to hard bedrock. Holmdel soils have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 10 to 20 inches (somewhat poorly drained) and are formed in glauconite bearing eolian and/or fluviomarine deposits. Manokin (T) soils formed in loess over fluviomarine sediments.  Trackler soils formed in colluvium and residuum from fine-grained igneous rocks. Wharton soils formed in residuum from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Whiteside soils formed in colluvium in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Woodstown soils formed in marine sediments that do not contain glauconite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kensington soils formed in loess and Illinoian age or Wisconsinan age till and material weathered from the underlying Pennsylvanian age shale, fine grained sandstone, or siltstone and are on interfluves, side slopes, nose slopes and head slopes of till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 to 53 degrees F."

The well drained, moderately deep, Berks and Gilpin soils are on interfluves, side slopes, and nose slopes on nearby uplands. Bogart and the well drained Chili soils formed in Wisconsinan age stratified outwash and are on nearby terraces and outwash plains. Canfield soils formed in Wisconsinan age till, have a fragipan horizon, and are on similar positions. The well drained Mechanicsburg soils are on similar positions."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Permeability is moderate in the till material and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying material, above the bedrock. In undisturbed areas the depth to a perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet during November to April in normal years."
