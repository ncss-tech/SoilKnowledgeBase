  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Knoxdale soils are on flood plains along streams in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium washed mainly from areas of calcareous loamy drift or lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 274 meters (600 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Flatrock, somewhat poorly drained Shoals, and very poorly drained Sloan soils are members of the same drainage sequence and are on lower landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Defiance soils are on flats and in slight depressions. The very poorly drained Wabasha soils are in depressions and abandoned meanders. The well drained Rossburg and the moderately well drained Medway soils have mollic epipedons and are on similar landscape positions along major rivers and streams."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum."

Some areas of Genesee soils were correlated as taxadjuncts (because of the presence of cambic horizons) to the Genesee series during the original surveys in northwestern Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
