  "OVERVIEW": "The Kiyi series consists of very deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in residuum and slope alluvium from rhyolite.  Kiyi soils are on mountains and foothills.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 18 inches, and the average annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",
