The series was updated in 2004 to allow a BCt horizon below the Bt horizon in some pedons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 28 to 78 (11 to 31 in).  (Bt horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in).  (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 28 to 119 cm (11 to 47 in).  (Bt and BCt horizons)\nAdditional Comments:\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S72TEX-212-1 from Smith County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data from OSD type location, S72TEX-212-1.  Particle-size analysis tests have been performed at various soil survey offices on over 50 pedons.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
