They formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are in a continental climate having dry summers and cool, most winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days"

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from the surface to 60 inches with an assumed irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth\nAquic moisture regime\nToo little clay increase in the Btg horizon to qualify as an argillic horizon\nParticle-size control section the zone from 10 to 40 inches\nThis revision 3/03 reflects a change in the type location; moving from Spokane County to Klickitat County, WA. The revision is based on extensive evaluation within the Spokane County update survey area and supporting lab data from the associated Clarkia series. The revision has resulted in the newly proposed Kronquist series reflecting isotic mineralogy, frigid soil temperature and an Aquandic subgroup. In addition, based on further MLRA project leader field evaluation, the updated Spokane concept will also apply to Stevens County. As a result of this change, the modal concept of the Konner series has been moved to Klickitat County, WA. The Klickitat County pedon appears to have aquic conditions at a greater depth than that required for the Aquolls classification resulting in consideration of a relocation of the type location to Stevens County.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
