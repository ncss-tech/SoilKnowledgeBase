Argillic horizon: 13 to 114 centimeters (5 to 45 inches) (Bt, Btb, Btkb, and Btk horizons)\nA buried soil surface and pedon that ranges from 51 to 127 centimeters (20 to 50 inches) below the mineral soil surface. These soils have buried solums in which a younger soil is superimposed and merges with a paleosol so that either or both of the following conditions occur. (1) Some subhorizon in the lower solum is at least 1/2 unit of value darker or 1/2 unit of chroma grayer than the overlying horizon accompanied by horizons of silicate clay accumulation in which visible secondary calcium carbonate has accumulated predominantly on the surfaces of the peds or in the structural cracks between peds. (2) Some subhorizon has solum more than 102 centimeters (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon accompanied by subhorizons of silicate clay accumulation in the lower solum having visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation predominantly on the faces of the peds or in structural cracks between peds and with the interiors of at least some of the peds being noncalcareous. These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than 1/2 the time soil temperature is 5 degrees C (41 degrees F) or higher.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nKUMA SERIES\nLRR=G and H\nDATE: 04/15/96\n1.
