Kartar soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial till and glacial outwash.  Elevations are 1,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Leader soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are coarse-loamy over sandy.  Hudnut soils are similar, they are mixed and superactive and are 40 to over 60 inches to sandy material."
