  "OVERVIEW": "The Kartar series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial till and glacial outwash.  The Kartar soils are on till plains and outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
