  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kroto series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of ash-influenced loess overlying firm glacial till.  Kroto soils are on moraines, hills, and mountain footslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The pedons have a bisequal sola.  The combined sola ranges from 14 to 20 inches thick.  The upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon has less than 6 percent organic carbon.  The loess mantle ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness over the firm, glacial till substratum.  The sola is usually completely developed in the loess mantle, but, in some pedons, extends into the underlying till material.  The exchange complex of the sola is dominated by amorphous material.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue from 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue from 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizons have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  The buried solum is similar to the surface solum in color and texture.\nC horizons, below the buried solum, are present in some pedons\nThe 2C horizon is massive, firm, loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."

Boulder Point, Darling, Flat Horn, Tuomi(T), and Whitsol soils have loose or friable substratums.  Cohoe soils have strata of sand and sandy loam in the control section.  Kenai soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the substratum.  Strandline and Swanson(T) soils have loess mantles thicker than 20 inches.  Chuit and Puntilla soils have more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper part of the spodic horizon.  Chulitna, Kashwitna, and Nancy soils are sandy or sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the control section."
