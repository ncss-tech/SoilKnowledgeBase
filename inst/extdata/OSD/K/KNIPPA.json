  "OVERVIEW": "The Knippa series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived from limestone.  The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces of piedmont alluvial plains below limestone hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
