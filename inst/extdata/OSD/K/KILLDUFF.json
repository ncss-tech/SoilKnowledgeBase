  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nKillduff soils are on short, convex to straight side slopes, coves at the head of drainageways, and in a few places, the tops of lowered interfluves in uplands.  These soils formed in a deoxidized and leached or a thin, mottled, oxidized and leached over a deoxidized and leached weathering zone in Wisconsinan Age loess.  The loess is 4 to 15 feet thick and is underlain by pre-Wisconsin glacial till.\nClay films are noticeable, but the increase in clay from the A to the B horizons fails to meet the 1.2 required for an argillic horizon.  The gray colors were not used in the classification of this soil, as they are considered to be inherited from a relict deoxidized and leached weathering zone.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (9 inches Ap and A horizons);\ncambic horizon - the zone from 23 to 117 centimeters (9 to 46 inches (BA, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons).\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014\nAdditional Data:\nPedon data from soil characterization lab at Iowa State University and the KSSL was evaluated in July 2015 in revising the Range in Characteristics.\nNASIS Pedon ID#--1981IA157005\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
