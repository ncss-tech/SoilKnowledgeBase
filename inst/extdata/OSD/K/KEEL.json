  "OVERVIEW": "The Keel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from basic igneous rock and mixed with volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 85 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist but it is dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has a phosphate retention of 90 to 100 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus on-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, and 15-bar moisture of 20 to 30 percent based on an air-dried sample.  The soil is moderately acid through very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is cobbly clay loam or gravelly silt loam, and has 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  It has moderate fine or very fine granular or subangular blocky structure. It has a bulk density of 0.40 to 0.85 g/cubic centimeter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, cobbly loam, or clay loam.  It has 18 to 32 percent clay, 5 to 20 percent gravel, and 5 to 20 percent cobbles.  It has weak to moderate, medium to very fine subangular blocky structure."
