  "OVERVIEW": "The Kendall series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. These soils are on outwash plains, till plains, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 838 mm (33 inches).",

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour). Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) and permeability is rapid (6 to 20 inches per hour) in the substratum of the sandy substratum phase.
