    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kendall soils are on loess-covered outwash plains, stream terraces, and sandy loam till plains of Wisconsinan Age.

Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1041 mm (29 to 41 inches), frost free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 183 to 311 meters (600 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Starks soils and the Camden, Drummer, Sexton, and St. Charles soils. The competing Starks soils are on nearby similar landscapes where the loess or other silty material is thinner. The well drained Camden and St. Charles soils are on slightly higher pitions or more sloping parts of the landscape. The poorly drained Drummer and Sexton soils are on lower positions of the landscape. Drummer soils have a mollic epipedon and lack an argillic horizon. Sexton soils average more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour). Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) and permeability is rapid (6 to 20 inches per hour) in the substratum of the sandy substratum phase. Some low-lying areas on terraces are flooded after unusually high rainfall. A rarely flooded phase is recognized."
