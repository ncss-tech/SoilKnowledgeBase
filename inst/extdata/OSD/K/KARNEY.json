  "OVERVIEW": "The Karney series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in alluvium and colluvium from welded tuff, lacustrine sediments and granitic rocks over grus. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Gimmi soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not have hard bedrock above 60 inches. Hann soils are very deep to bedrock. Kuck soils have cracks 1 to 2 cm wide that extend to the surface, have dry colors throughout the Bt horizon of value 4 or 5 and chroma 1 or 2, and do not have a lithic contact within 60 inches. McDesh soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to hard bedrock. Montour soils are calcareous at depths of 29 to 32 inches and are very deep to bedrock. Tub soils are very deep to bedrock and have secondary carbonates at a depth of 18 to 37 inches. Ukiah soils have a mollic epipedon 15 to 30 inches thick, cracks greater than 1cm wide that extend to the surface (when uncultivated), and have a paralithic contact of basaltic or volcanic tuff origin."
