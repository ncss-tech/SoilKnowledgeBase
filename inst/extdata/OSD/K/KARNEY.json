Darow soils have mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F. and are moderately well drained. Forsgren soils are calcareous at depths of 40 to 55 inches and are very deep to bedrock. Gimmi soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not have hard bedrock above 60 inches. Hann soils are very deep to bedrock. Kuck soils have cracks 1 to 2 cm wide that extend to the surface, have dry colors throughout the Bt horizon of value 4 or 5 and chroma 1 or 2, and do not have a lithic contact within 60 inches. McDesh soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to hard bedrock. Montour soils are calcareous at depths of 29 to 32 inches and are very deep to bedrock. Tub soils are very deep to bedrock and have secondary carbonates at a depth of 18 to 37 inches. Ukiah soils have a mollic epipedon 15 to 30 inches thick, cracks greater than 1cm wide that extend to the surface (when uncultivated), and have a paralithic contact of basaltic or volcanic tuff origin."

The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from welded tuff, lacustrine sediments and granitic rocks over grus. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The average annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
