These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum is 7 to 20 inches thick and has an estimated bulk density of 1.00 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 5 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chromas of 3 or 4 dry.  It is cobbly ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has 10 to 35 percent pebbles, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizons has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Karu soils are on backslopes of mountains usually with a southerly aspect.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 5,800 feet.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium over till from metaigneous rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F, average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
