  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Browndell, Colita, Montevallo, Nebgen, and Norris soils are in closely related families. Browndell soils have a clayey Bt horizon with smectitic mineralogy. Colita soils have an argillic horizon and are moderately deep. Montevallo soils have a cambic horizon and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the solum. Nebgen soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods of time. Norris soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 59 degrees F. and are more acid."

The soils formed in beds of tuffaceous sandstone, siltstone, ash, and pyroclastic materials mainly of the Catahoula Formation. Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches, average annual temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F., and Thornthwaite P-E index is 68 to 72."
