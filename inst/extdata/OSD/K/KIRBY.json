  "REVDATE": "04/2002",
  "STATES": "MT,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kirby series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum derived from porcelanite, locally called scorio*.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, ridges, hills and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The rock fragments are porcelanite.\nDepth to fragmental material - 11 to 20 inches.\nSoil phases - nonstony.\nA horizon - Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist\nChroma:  3, 4, or 6\nTexture:  loam or sandy loam\nClay content:  10 to 25 percent\nRock fragments:  15 to 70 percent--0 to 10 percent flagstones and stones, 15 to 70 percent channers\nReaction:  pH 6.6 to 8.4\n*The rock fragments in the Kirby soil are porcelanite but more locally called scorio which is defined as the product resulting from baking of shale and sandstone bedrock that was adjacent to burning coal beds.\nBk horizon - Hue:  2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR\nValue:  5, 6, or 7 dry; 4, 5, or 6 moist\nChroma:  3, 4, or 6\nTexture:  loam or sandy loam\nClay content:  8 to 25 percent\nRock fragments:  40 to 90 percent--5 to 20 percent flagstones and cobbles, 35 to 70 percent channers\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 15 percent\nReaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4\n2C horizon:  This horizon consists of highly fractured and displaced porcelanite.  The coloring of this material ranges from reddish gray (10R 6/1) through yellowish red (5YR 4/6).  Rock fragments of flagstones, stones, and channers make up 90 to 95 percent of this horizon."
