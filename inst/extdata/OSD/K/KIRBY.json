The rock fragments are porcelanite.\nDepth to fragmental material - 11 to 20 inches.\nSoil phases - nonstony.\nA horizon - Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist\nChroma:  3, 4, or 6\nTexture:  loam or sandy loam\nClay content:  10 to 25 percent\nRock fragments:  15 to 70 percent--0 to 10 percent flagstones and stones, 15 to 70 percent channers\nReaction:  pH 6.6 to 8.4\n*The rock fragments in the Kirby soil are porcelanite but more locally called scorio which is defined as the product resulting from baking of shale and sandstone bedrock that was adjacent to burning coal beds.\nBk horizon - Hue:  2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR\nValue:  5, 6, or 7 dry; 4, 5, or 6 moist\nChroma:  3, 4, or 6\nTexture:  loam or sandy loam\nClay content:  8 to 25 percent\nRock fragments:  40 to 90 percent--5 to 20 percent flagstones and cobbles, 35 to 70 percent channers\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 15 percent\nReaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4\n2C horizon:  This horizon consists of highly fractured and displaced porcelanite.  The coloring of this material ranges from reddish gray (10R 6/1) through yellowish red (5YR 4/6).  Rock fragments of flagstones, stones, and channers make up 90 to 95 percent of this horizon."
