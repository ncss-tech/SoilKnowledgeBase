  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenmoor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy alluvium over clayey alluvium on flood plains and flood-plain steps of major streams. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 940 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C.",
