  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonate ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches in thickness and extends into the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is loam but is clay loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Free carbonate is not in the Bt horizon of some pedons.  The Bt horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline and the Btk horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay or clay loam.  It has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has colors like that of the Bk horizon.  The C horizon typically is clay loam or loam but is clay in some pedons.  It has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonates.  Thin strata of coarser textured material are between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beadle, Carlson, Harney, McClure, Mento, Peno, Raber, Reliance, and Spearville soils in the same family.  Beadle, Peno, and Raber soils formed in glacial till.  Carlson, Harney, Mento, and Spearville soils have mean annual temperatures higher than 52 degrees F.  In addition, Carlson soils typically are shallower to carbonates, Harney soils have thicker sola, and Mento soils have 5 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the B and C horizons.  McClure, Reliance, and Richfield soils contain less sand in the series control section and formed in loess."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches."

Ree soils are in adjacent nearby landscapes.  Canning soils have sand and gravel within depths of 40 inches and are in nearby landscapes.  Mosher soils have natric horizons and are in the same landscapes.  Sansarc soils are shallow to shale and are on nearby steep landscapes."
