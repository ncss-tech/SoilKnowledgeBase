  "OVERVIEW": "The Kiolakaa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils.  These soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1140 millimeters (45 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to gently sloping pahoehoe lava flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 760 to 1520 millimeters (30 to 60 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1780 millimeters (50 to 70 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 18 to 21 degrees C (65 to 70 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
