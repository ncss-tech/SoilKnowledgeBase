  "OVERVIEW": "The Koyokee series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  These soils formed in Tertiary sediments.  Slope is 4 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 2,800 to 3,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
