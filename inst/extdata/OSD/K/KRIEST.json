  "OVERVIEW": "The Kriest series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain and foothill slopes and ridges.  They formed in glacial till and residuum with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess in the surface layers.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
