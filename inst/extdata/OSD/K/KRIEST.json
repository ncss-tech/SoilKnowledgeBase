They formed in glacial till and residuum derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess in the surface.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.   The average frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
