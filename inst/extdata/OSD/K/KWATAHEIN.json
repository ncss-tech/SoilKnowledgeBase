  "OVERVIEW": "The Kwatahein series consists of very deep, well drained soils developed in residuum from partially consolidated, soft siltstone or mudstone bedrock. Kwatahein soils occur on infrequently dissected smooth hillslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 95 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches.  Elevation ranges from near sea level to 2000 feet.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragments are typically sharp angular gravel size fragments of siltstone or mudstone.  Coarse fragment content typically increases with depth, but the weighted average in the control section ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and is moderately acid or slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe combined thickness of the O horizon ranges from 4 to 13 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value from 4 to 6, and chroma from 1 to 3. Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value from 3 to 5, and chroma from 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value from 4 to 6, and chroma from 2 to 8.  Texture typically is loam or gravelly loam but ranges to include silt loam and sandy loam. Consistence is friable or firm."
