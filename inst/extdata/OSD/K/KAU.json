  "OVERVIEW": "The Kau series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash deposited over `a`a lava. Kau soils are located on the windward slopes of Mauna Loa volcano.  Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 2300 millimeters (91 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
