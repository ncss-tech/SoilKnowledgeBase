  "OVERVIEW": "The Kolls series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium in upland basins.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes are 1 percent or less.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section typically averages about 60 percent clay and ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Few or common brownish redoximorphic concentrations are in the upper 36 inches in some pedons.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is less than 20 inches, but exceeds 30 inches in some pedons.  Carbonates are at or within a few inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is silty clay but is clay in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bw horizon.\nThe Bssg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BCssyzg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  It has few to many accumulations of gypsum and other salts.\nThe Cssyzg and Cyzg horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Chroma of 3 is below depths of 40 inches.  It has fine accumulations of carbonates in some pedons.  It does not have accumulations of gypsum in some pedons.  Shale is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The basins range in size from a few yards in diameter to several hundred acres.  The soils formed in local clayey alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Growing season ranges from 130 to 160 days; growing season precipitation is about 12 to 24 inches; and growing season degree days ranges from 2700 to 3300."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly or very poorly drained.  No surface runoff occurs unless artificially drained.  These soils are ponded from surface runoff from surrounding soils for periods of 15 to 60 days in most years.  These soils are saturated for 30 to 60 days or more to a depth of 3 feet or more in most years.  Permeability is very slow except after periods of drought when initial intake may be rapid due to cracks."
