  "OVERVIEW": "The Keith series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in calcareous loess. Keith soils are on upland hillslopes, tableland plains, and valley terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
