  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  The upper part of the control section is stratified very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and silt loam.  The composite texture contains less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The lower part of the control section is stratified sand and loamy sand with occasional strata of sandy loam and silt loam. Composite texture is sandy and coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 70 percent rounded gravel and cobble.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 12 to 30 inches. Accumulations of lime are on the undersides of many of the coarse fragments.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral in the A and C horizons and neutral to moderately alkaline in the 2C horizons.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value from 2 through 4; and moist chroma from 1 through 3.  Texture includes very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam.  This horizon is finely stratified in many pedons.\nThe C horizon has moist hue from 10YR through 5Y; moist value from 2 through 4; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is highly stratified sandy loam, silt loam, and loamy sand.  Composite texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Occasional brown (7.5YR 4/4) mottles are present in the silty strata.  Dark colors are due to the high concentration of black sand grains.\nThe 2C horizon has moist hue from 10YR through 5Y; moist value from 2 through 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures include sand or loamy sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 70 percent with 35 to 45 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobble.  Lime coatings are present on the undersides of many coarse fragments.  Reaction to cold dilute HCl is weakly to strongly effervescent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klutina soils formed in stratified loamy alluvium over sandy and sandy-skeletal alluvium on low stream terraces and floodplains.  The terraces are often dissected.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches, and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual  temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."
