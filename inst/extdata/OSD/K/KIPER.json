The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall. Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 41 inches. Base saturation from 10 to 30 inches is estimated to range from 50 to 60 percent. The particle-size control section averages 55 to 70 percent sand and 5 to 10 percent clay by weight in the fine earth fraction and 5 to 20 percent hard rock fragments and 15 to 50 percent weathered rock fragments by volume..\nThe A horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Texture is stony ashy sandy loam or ashy sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Texture is gravelly ashy sandy loam or ashy sandy loam. It averages 5 to 20 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent paragravel and 5 to 25 percent paracobbles.\nThe C horizon has a value of 4 or 5 moist. Texture is a gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam, or sandy loam. It averages 10 to 20 percent gravel, 15 to 25 percent paragravel, and 5 to 25 percent paracobbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kiper soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from swauk sandstone with minor additions of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevation is 3,600 to 5,500 feet. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 40 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F. The average annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 170 days."

Jumpe soils average 35 to 65 percent basalt fragments by volume in the particle size control section. Loneridge soils have an argillic horizon and average 40 to 75 percent basalt rock fragments by volume in the particle size control section. Tepping soils have an argillic horizon, average 25 to 34 percent clay, and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall. Scotties soils are loamy-skeletal, solum thickness ranges from 15 to 20 inches and are dominated by volcanic ash in the upper 7 to 13 inches."
