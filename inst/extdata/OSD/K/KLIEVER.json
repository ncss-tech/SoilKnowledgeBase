  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kliever series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands that were high terraces abandoned by the Missouri River. They formed in alluvium. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F..",

Caprell, McHenry, Pecatonica, Renova, and Westville soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degress F., and formed in loess and glacial till. Douds and Wykoff soils are stratified in the lower part of the profile. Letort soils have mica flakes throughout the profile. Lindley soils formed in glacial till. Bluemount, Mandeville, Norden, and Whalan soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Grellton, Nodine, and Plumcreek soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F. Rockbridge and Wykoff soils have a solum that is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Teresa soils a densic layer at 24 to 40 inches."
