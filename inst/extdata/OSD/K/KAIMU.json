  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kaimu soils are on low elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from sea level to 305 meters (0 to 1000 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a flows that are 750 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 2030 millimeters (40 to 80 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 75 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
