  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenotrail series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived primarily from serpentine, greenstone, and talc with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on ridges and shoulders of mountains.  Slope ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
