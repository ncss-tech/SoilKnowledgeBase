  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenotrail series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived primarily from serpentine, greenstone, and talc with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on ridges and shoulders of mountains.  Slope ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of\n1.35 to 1.50 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact with weathered talc range from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5 moist or dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam and is 15 to 35 percent pebbles and 15 to 30 percent weathered pebble-size talc fragments.  There are few thin to moderately thick clay films on ped faces and lining pores."
