It is also assumed that enough ash is present for those layers to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence. The Kinney series has been mapped in Clackamas, Clark, Douglas, Lane, Linn, Marion, and Skamania Counties. Ash influence has been recognized in some of these counties, but not in all of them. The series has also been mapped on granodiorite in Skamania County and as formed in till in Lane and Marion Counties. Future investigation is needed to confirm the extent of the volcanic ash influence and to determine the correct parent material.\nClimate and elevation data suggest that the Kinney series has been mapped across both mesic and frigid temperature regimes. Further investigation is needed to determine if the soils at the higher elevations should be correlated to the similar Browder series in the frigid zone.\nThe Gobar series is similar to the Kinney series; it should be reviewed for potential correlation into the Kinney series."
