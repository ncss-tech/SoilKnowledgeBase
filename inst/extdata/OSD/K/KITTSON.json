    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 11 to 30 inches.  The thickness of the water-sorted sediments over till ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  The content of rock fragments in the upper sediment ranges from none to 35 percent by volume with the greater contents being only in the lower part.  The upper mantle averages 50 to 65 percent sand.  The content of rock fragments in the till ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and 25 to 50 percent sand.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less or a horizon with a matrix having chroma of 2 with redoximorphic features are within depths of 40 inches.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 consecutive days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  An AB or BA horizon as much as 6 inches thick is in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Redoximorphic features are in the lower part in some pedons. It has a texture range that is the same as the A horizon except that the lower 5 inches or less in some pedons is loamy sand or coarser.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 30 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has a matrix with hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically has redoximorphic features in all parts.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Its calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in a 11- to 30-inch layer of loamy, water-sorted sediments over calcareous, loamy glacial till.  These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  Frost-free days range from 95 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1500 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches; cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 17 inches (Bw horizon).\nThe classification was changed to the Oxyaquic subgroup even though the morphology of this pedon may meet the Aquic subgroup criteria because it was felt Oxyaquic better fit the water state of the series.  In addition, the somewhat poorly drained phase was eliminated from the range of the series.  A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series and another series established for the Aquic subgroup and somewhat poorly drained phase.  01/2000.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station central file Numbers 1757 (typical), 1187, 1368 and 1369 for results of some laboratory analysis of some pedons of this series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
