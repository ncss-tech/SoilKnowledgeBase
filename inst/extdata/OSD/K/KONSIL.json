Fragments less than three inches across of sandstone, ironstone, or chert range from none to less than 5 percent by volume throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4.  The A2 horizon is one to three units of value higher than the A1 horizon.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam on loamy fine sand.  The reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 8.  Few to common mottles in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray are in the lower part of some pedons.  Colors in hues of 10YR and 7.5YR are in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches.  The texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  The clay content of the control section is 18 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, with values mainly of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 8.  It is weakly cemented sandstone or stratified sandstone and loamy soil materials.  Some pedons contain sandy strata."

Galey and Gasil soils have color in hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the upper B2t horizons.  In addition, Galey soils have mixed mineralogy.  Bastrop, Bastsil, Duffau, Konawa, May, and Silawa soils have argillic horizons with base saturation of more than 75 percent in some part.  Also, Bastrop, Konawa, and May soils have mixed mineralogy.  Stephenville and Weatherford soils have sola less than 60 inches thick."

The soils formed in weathered beds of loamy material and interbedded sandstones of the Woodbind member of upper Cretaceous.  Mean annual temperature is 64 degrees to 69 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 38 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are 44 to 64.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240.  Elevation ranges from 400 to 900 feet."

Callisburg and Truce soils are slightly lower and usually on lesser slopes.  Silstid and Stephenville soils are slightly above and on similar slopes."
