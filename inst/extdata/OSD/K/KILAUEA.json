(iso temperature regime).\nSoil moisture - dry in some or all parts for 90 days or more in most years (Ustic moisture regime).\nSoil reaction - low pH in the surface layer is attributed to sulfur fumes from volcanic vents and acid rain.\nEdit Log: 12/03 KH. Added \"ashy\" modifier to textures.\n3/01 KH. Drainage changed from somewhat excessive.\n9/99 KH. Type location changed.  Classification changed due to changes in Taxonomy, and based on lab data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kilauea reference sample (soil crust) NSSL S96-HI-001-009 and S96-HI-001-010, and grab sample S97HI-001-003.\nPenetrometer measurements\nCm horizon = >4 tons/square foot\nC2 horizon =  2 tons/square foot\nC3 horizon =  4 tons/square foot\nPenetrometer measurements were made by inserting penetrometer horizontally into \"in situ\" soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
