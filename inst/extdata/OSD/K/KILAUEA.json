  "OVERVIEW": "The Kilauea series consists of deep and very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in basic pyroclastic material and reworked eolian and alluvial sediment over pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1,270 millimeters (50 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C. (60 degrees F.)",

Added \"ashy\" modifier to textures.\n3/01 KH. Drainage changed from somewhat excessive.\n9/99 KH. Type location changed.  Classification changed due to changes in Taxonomy, and based on lab data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kilauea reference sample (soil crust) NSSL S96-HI-001-009 and S96-HI-001-010, and grab sample S97HI-001-003.\nPenetrometer measurements\nCm horizon = >4 tons/square foot\nC2 horizon =  2 tons/square foot\nC3 horizon =  4 tons/square foot\nPenetrometer measurements were made by inserting penetrometer horizontally into \"in situ\" soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
