    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 8 to 20 inches. Rock fragments are shale, limestone, and sandstone mainly less than 3 inches in size. The soil is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and less commonly 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is clay loam, but the range includes silt loam and loam. Rock fragments range from 0 to 14 percent channers. Organic matter content ranges from 0.4 to 0.7 percent.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR and less commonly 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry,  2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent channers.\nSome pedons have thin C horizons."
