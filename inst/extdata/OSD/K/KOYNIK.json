  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Koynik series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and calcareous shale. Koynik soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
