  "OVERVIEW": "The Kerrick series consists of well drained, moderately permeable soils that are moderately deep over an indurated caliche layer.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy eolian deposits of Pleistocene age over indurated caliche of Pliocene age.  They occur on nearly level to gently sloping eolian plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19.5 inches), and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
