  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments of gravels, cobbles, and channers make up 5 to 30 percent.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid, where unlimed.  Clay content ranges from 4 to 18 percent.\nThe 0 horizon ranges from undecomposed forest litter to sapric material.  It ranges from 1 to 3 inches thick in forested areas.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The A or Ap horizon is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chorma of 1 or 2.  Texture is similar to the A horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Consistence ranges from very friable to firm.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have thin layers of soft weathered rock overlying hard rock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Brimfield, Cleveland, Elkmound, Hollis, and Holyoke soils are in the same family.  Brimfield soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the B horizon.  Cleveland soils have less than 20 percent silt.  Elkmound soils contain more sand and are underlain by sandstone.  Hollis soils are higher in fine sand and developed in glacial till dominated by rock fragments of gneiss and schist.  Holyoke soils have rock fragments dominated by basalt and sandstone.  Similar soils in related families are Arnot, Catlett, Dimal, Hubbardton, Klinesville, Macomber, Nassau, Taconic, Umpcoos, Unicoi, and Weikert.  All of these soils, except Macomber, are skeletal.  Hubbardton, Macomber, and Taconic soils are frigid."

The soils are derived from schist, slate, or phyllite.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 50 inches and the frost-free period is 110 to 180 days.
