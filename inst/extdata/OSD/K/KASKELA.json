  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have cracks 5mm or more wide that open and close each year and remain open for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the B horizon.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to over 60 inches. Hue is 2.5YR to 7.5YR.  The particle-size control section averages 60 to 70 percent clay.  Depth to the Bk horizon is 30 to 45 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is clay or cobbly clay and has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bss horizon has color similar to the Bt horizon.  It is moderate to strong blocky structure with common to many intersecting slickensides and when dry, very coarse irregular prismatic structure with prominent vertical cracking.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam withy 30 to 40 percent clay.  Soil reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

The soil is formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary bedrock.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 2400 to 4200 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
