  "OVERVIEW": "The Kolcheck series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from quartzite, with minor amounts of limestone. Kolcheck soils are in depressions on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
