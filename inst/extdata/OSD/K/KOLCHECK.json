  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kolcheck soils are in broad linear depressions on mountains. They formed in colluvium derived mainly from quartzite, with minor amounts of limestone. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 2,130 to 2,950 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."

Brokit soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size control section with 12 to 20 percent clay in the upper part and 3 to 10 percent clay in the lower part. Cooperwash soils are well drained, have mollic epipedons that are 80 to 150 cm thick, and have Btkss horizons. Successloop soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
