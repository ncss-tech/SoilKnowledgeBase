Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 2,020 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Some areas of rangeland have been seeded to crested wheatgrass."
