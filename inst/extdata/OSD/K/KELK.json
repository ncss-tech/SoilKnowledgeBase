  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kelk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and loess derived from volcanic rocks.  Kelk soils are on inset fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C.",
