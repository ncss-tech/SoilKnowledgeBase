  "OVERVIEW": "The Keei series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of organic material and small amounts of volcanic ash overlying pahoehoe lava.  Keei soils are on the windward slopes of Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 3048 millimeters (120 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
