Breece soils contain gravelly horizons with fragments of granite, and are more moist during May and June.  Breeton and Chrishall soils contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Coberly soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Dotsero, Hedoes and Parshall soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations.  Ruso soils have stratified sand and gravel within 40 inches. Tuntsa soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section more than 60 percent of the time that the soil is above 41 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches, and have mean annual soil temperatures 44 to 47 degrees F."

Slopes are 1 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 60 to 100 days."
