  "OVERVIEW": "The Klizhin series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone.  Klizhin soils are on footslopes of high plateaus, mesas, and structural benches and have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes are 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
