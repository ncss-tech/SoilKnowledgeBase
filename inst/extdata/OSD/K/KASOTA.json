  "OVERVIEW": "The Kasota series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy and clayey sediments and the underlying sandy and gravelly sediments. They are on river terraces and outwash plains.  They have moderately slow permeability in the clayey sediments, and rapid permeability in the underlying sandy and gravelly sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to free carbonates is 24 to 50 inches.  The depth to sandy and gravelly sediments ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 0 to 10 percent of the volume of the upper sediments, and the lower sediments contain as much as 25 percent rock fragments by volume. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 9 to 18 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically silt loam or loam, but in some pedons is silty clay loam, sandy loam or clay loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically clay, silty clay or clay loam, but thin strata of silty clay loam or loam are in some pedons.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is typically, coarse sand, sand or their gravelly analogues and stratified in many pedons.  Strata of fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand are in some pedons.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
