  "OVERVIEW": "The Kalispell series comprises deep well drained medium textured Chestnut soils formed on outwash, glacial lake and stream-laid terraces.  The parent material is largely from argillites, quartzites and dolomitic limestone rocks.  Like the Creston and Mires series (Chernozem soils) the Kalispell soil profile has weak horizonation in the sola.  It has a thinner A1 horizon than these series, is shallower in depth to the Cca horizon than the Creston series and lacks the gravel and sand substratum that underlies the Mires series.  The sequence of horizons, color, and texture are about the same in the Kalispell series as in the associated Prospect series (Chestnut soils), but the Kalispell soil profile contains much more silt than sand and lacks the coarse fragments that are randomly distributed throughout the profile of the Prospect series.  The Tally soils are the associated Chernozemic Regosols developed in coarse textured alluvium.  The Kalispell series has a browner color, is a little less clayey, and is better drained than the Somers series that occurs on the lower and younger terraces.  The Kalispell series is inextensive except locally where it is an important agricultural soil.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The color of the A1 horizon ranges in Munsell values of 4 to 5 dry and 2 to 3 moist; being thinner and the surface soil being somewhat lighter colored than noted above on the moderately to steeply sloping areas.  Loam and silt loam types and substratum phases are recognized in mapping.  Small areas of Kalispell soils are slightly to moderately affected by saline-alkali conditions.  Where more than 10 to 15 percent of an area is so affected, a Kalispell-Tuffit complex is recognized, the Tuffit being the Solonetz associate."
