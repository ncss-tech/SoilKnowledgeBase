    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The color of the A1 horizon ranges in Munsell values of 4 to 5 dry and 2 to 3 moist; being thinner and the surface soil being somewhat lighter colored than noted above on the moderately to steeply sloping areas.  Loam and silt loam types and substratum phases are recognized in mapping.  Small areas of Kalispell soils are slightly to moderately affected by saline-alkali conditions.  Where more than 10 to 15 percent of an area is so affected, a Kalispell-Tuffit complex is recognized, the Tuffit being the Solonetz associate."
