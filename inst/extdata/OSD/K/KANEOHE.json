    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Weathered gravel ranges from 5 to 25 percent by volume; size, amount, and hardness increases as depth increases.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 72 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and dry, and chroma of 4 through 6.  The Bt2 horizon is silty clay or silty clay loam.  Consistence of the B horizon ranges from slightly plastic to plastic.  The soil, particularly the B horizon, tends to dry irreversibly when exposed to the air."
