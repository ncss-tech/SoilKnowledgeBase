  "OVERVIEW": "The Kniesley series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Kniesley soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 100 and 150 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between April and September. Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  The water table under natural conditions is at 45 to 90 cm.  Drainage ditches have been constructed to lower the water table during the irrigation season."

    "content": "REMARKS: The revision of July 2009 updates the classification from Aeric Fluvaquents to Oxyaquic Xerofluvents because the water table is lowering due to drainage and down cutting.  The revision of December 2002 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-silty over clayey, mixed, calcareous, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of Ckyz horizons).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to clayey material at 64 cm (between the Ab2 and 2Cyzb horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 100 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the 2Ckb1 and 2Ckb2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Ab1, Ab2, and 2Cyzb horizons and parts of the Ckyz and 2Ckb1 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
