  "OVERVIEW": "The Kimmell series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till over sandy outwash on outwash floored till plains. These soils are moderately deep or deep to dense till. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
