  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at the surface of the bedrock ranges from 47 degrees to 55 degrees F.  They are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 70 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments in the control section average 10 to 35 percent and may be pebbles, cobbles or stones. Soil texture is loam or silt loam. Soil reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline and in some pedons there is free carbonate accumulation on the bottom of rock fragments and in cracks of the bedrock.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Godde, Iron Mountain, Soaplake, Stukel and Yakus series.  Godde and Soaplake soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Iron Mountain soils are somewhat excessively drained and are dry for less than 70 days.  Stukel soils lack B2 horizons, formed in residual material weathered from tuff and diatomite and are dry for more than 100 days following the summer solstice. Yakus soils have coarse sandy loam to light sandy clay loam B2 horizons and formed in residuum from gneiss, schist and granite bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kuhl soils occupy gently undulating basalt plateaus and steep canyon slopes at elevations of 500 to 2,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  They formed in mixed loess, alluvium, and colluvium from mostly basic igneous rocks. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool winters. The average January  temperature is 29 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 72 degrees F. and average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. Frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."
