These soils are on all hillslope positions of gently sloping to steep lava flows, very steep cinder cones and gully slopes. Slope gradients range from 3 to 70 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 2,032 to 3,810 millimeters (80 to 150 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The soils are subject to frequent cloudiness and fog. The mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 20 degrees C (57 to 68 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
