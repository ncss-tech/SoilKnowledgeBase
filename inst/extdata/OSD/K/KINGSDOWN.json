  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Kingsdown series is the only series in this family.  Series in other similiar families are the Anselmo, Attica, Bayard, Devol, Eda, Manter, Mobeetie, Otero, Paloduro, and Ronson.  Anselmo, and Attica soils lack carbonates above a depth of 15 inches.  In addition, these soils are mesic; Devol, and Mobeetie soils lack a mollic epipedon; and Eda soils are sandy.  Bayard, Manter, and Otero soils are in a drier climate and are mesic.  Paloduro soils are fine loamy.  Ronson soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over sandstone and are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The mean annual temperature range from 57 to 62 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  Thornthwaite Annual P-E index ranges from 32 to 40.  Frost free days range from 185 to 210.  Elevation ranges from 1700 to 2200 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Lesho soils and fine-loamy Spur soils are on adjacent flood plains.  The Selman soils are fine-silty are on slightly higher positions."
