Balake, Beezee, and Sauter soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Bluesprin, Jellico, Shanks and Sienna soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Nashmead soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Fordice soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F., are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days and are dominated by rounded rock fragments of varying stages of weathering. Hunsinger soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Legall soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days. Riverpoint soils are dry for 60 to 90 consective days and are 25 to 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon."

The vegetation and mean annual precipitation seem to indicate greater than 60 consecutive dry days by convention.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
