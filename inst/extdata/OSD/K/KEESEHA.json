  "OVERVIEW": "The Keeseha series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits.  Keeseha soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
