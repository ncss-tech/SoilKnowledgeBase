  "OVERVIEW": "The Kirkville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains of the Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 135). They formed in loamy alluvium. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the mean annual rainfall is about 53 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

The Cascilla, Jena, Nugent and Ochlockonee soils are on slightly higher natural levees near stream channels and the Cascilla, Jena and Ochlockonee are well drained. In addition, Cascilla soils have fine-silty control sections. The excessively drained Nugent soils have sandy control sections and thin bedding planes of finer material in the upper 20 inches, Ochlockonee soils are structureless and have thin bedding planes in the upper 20 inches. Iuka soils are on similar positions but have stratification and are structureless. The somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils are on slightly lower positions and have fine-loamy control sections."
