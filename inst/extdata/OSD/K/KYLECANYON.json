  "OVERVIEW": "The Kylecanyon series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolostone. Kylecanyon soils are on smooth fan remnants. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 millimeters (10 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.).",
