    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kunayosh soils occupy uplifted sandy beaches and dunes adjacent to beaches still covered periodically by tidal water, and extending about 1/4 mile inland.  The climate is cool maritime with mean annual precipitation of 80 to 130 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. and average summer air temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The soils are seldom frozen."
