  "OVERVIEW": "The Kezar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite.  These soils are on upland hills, ridges, or mountain sides and have slopes of 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 58 degrees F.  The Kezar soils are normally noncalcareous throughout except very thin calcareous subhorizons occur just above the bedrock in some pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent but typically is more than 80 percent.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and any C horizon above the bedrock and are mostly smaller than 1 inch in diameter.  The solum ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline.  The moisture control section is dry in most parts 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 30 percent silt and 45 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand within the sand fraction.  A large percentage is medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand and has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.\nSome pedons have a thin 2Bt horizon just above the bedrock with up to 45 percent rock fragments."

Amsden, Coldspring, Croftshaw, Croydon, Gebson, Gelkie, Hourglass, Kittredge, Leavitt, Lyonman, Michelson, Monad, Monida, Morset, Oro Fino, Philipsburg, Sponsor, Swede, Tingey, Wellsville, and Youga soils lack a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Dra, Passcreek, Rammel, and Woosley soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand, are calcareous in the lower solum or any C horizons, and have continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulations.  Buffork, Cific, Inchau, Lymonson, Rainbolt, Tripit, and Troutdale soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Shotgun soils lack extremely hard consistency when dry and sandy textures in the profile.  Lucky soils have only small amounts of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand and lack very hard consistency when dry.  Miracle soils have hue of 5YR or redder and have argillic horizons with less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Slack soils have moisture control sections that are usually moist.  Mult soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and only small amounts of coarse and very coarse angular sand, and have coarse fragments throughout the solum that effervesce in dilute acid even though the soil mass is noncalcareous.  Mult soils also lack hard setting properties when dry.  Newlands and Primeaux soils have argillic horizons with le\nss than 35 percent fine or coarser sand."
