  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 85 inches.  Quartz gravel make up 0 to 35 percent of the solum and up to 50 percent of individual layers of the C horizon.  Silt content of the particle size control section averages from 20 to 50 percent.  Exchangeable aluminum is less than 6 meq/100 grams. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Value of 2 or 3 is limited to a thin A horizon.  The A horizon is loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam, in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The E horizon is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Lower subhorizons of some pedons range to hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  The Bt horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Most pedons have a subhorizon of the Bt that is brittle and somewhat compact in as much as 40 percent of the mass. This brittle or compact layer commonly has few to many pale brown, very pale brown, or light yellowish brown iron depletions and slightly lower clay content than overlying or underlying horizons.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Many pedons have masses of iron accumulation and iron depletions; and where present, iron depletions of low chroma are below a depth of 50 inches.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8, or it is varieagated with masses of Fe accumulation.  Texture ranges from loamy sand through sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Many pedons have masses of iron accumulation and iron depletions; and where present, iron depletions of low chroma are below a depth of 50 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: (This section not checked this date:added activity class)  These are the Apison, Biffle (T), Cahaba, Durham, Emporia, Euharlee, Granville, Hartsells, Linker, Nauvoo, Okeelala (T), Oktaha, Olla, Pirum, Sipsey, Smithdale, Spadra, Stringtown, and Suffolk series. The Apison, Biffle, Hartsells, Linker, Oktaha, and Sipsey soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Cahaba, Nauvoo, Ogeechee, and Smithdale soils have 5YR or redder hue in the Bt horizon. Durham soils have more weatherable minerals such as mica and feldspar in the lower part of the B horizon and a C horizon of saprolite.  Emporia soils have low chroma Fe depletions indicative of wetness below a depth of 36 to 40 inches.  Euharlee soils have rock fragments of chert throughout the solum and a C horizon of weathered siltstone, sandstone, and cherty limestone.  Granville soils have 6 to 13 meq/100 grams of exchangeable aluminum.  Olla and Spadra soils do not have a subhorizon of the Bt horizon that is somewhat compact and brittle in as much as 40 percent of the mass, and in addition Spadra soils have Bt horizon colors centered on hue of 5YR.  Pirum soils have sandstone or shale fragments and bedrock within a depth of 22 to 50 inches.  Stringtown soils contain 1 to 4 percent plinthite by volume in the Bt horizon and strata of soft shale and sandstone in the C horizon. Suffolk soils have a solum 30 to 50 inches thick."

These soils formed in loamy fluvial and marine sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 62 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 49 inches."

These soils are all on similar adjacent landscape positions as the Kempsville soils.  Atlee and Slagle soils have low chroma iron depletions at less than 50 inches.  Bourne soils have a fragipan and are on slightly lower side slopes.  Caroline soils are clayey; Rumford soils are coarse-loamy; Norfolk and Orangeburg soils have thicker argillic horizons; Uchee soils have a sandy surface layer thicker than 20 inches."
