The profile is slightly acid or neutral.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist or dry and chroma 2 or 3 moist or dry.

Kalae soils have an ochric epipedon with a chroma of 4 and are strongly acid throughout the argillic horizon.  Kanepuu soils have 5YR or 7.5YR hue in the argillic horizon.  Puu Opae soils are medium acid to very strongly acid throughout the solum and have base saturation of less than 50 percent.  Wahiawa soils lack an argillic horizon and have only a few patchy clay films in the lower part of the B horizon."

Elevations range from 300 to 1,200 feet.  Annual rainfall is 35 to 60 inches.  Average January temperature is about 69 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 74 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F."
