  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingdon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic mixed rock sources.  Kingdon soils are on low fan terraces.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the surface and decreases regularly with depth to less than 1 percent at a depth of 15 to 20 inches.  The moisture control section between a depth of 8 and 20 inches is dry throughout between June and October unless irrigated and moist throughout between mid-November and mid-April.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.  It is predominantly slightly acid to neutral but the range includes moderately acid as a result of long term applications of sulfur for disease control.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 3/4, 4/3 or 3/3.  Clay content in the textural control section is 15 to 18 percent but ranges up to 20 percent in the lower B horizons.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3 or 4/2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or coarse sandy loam."
