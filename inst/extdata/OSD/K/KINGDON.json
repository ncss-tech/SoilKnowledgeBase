    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 30 to 60 inches.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the surface and decreases regularly with depth to less than 1 percent at a depth of 15 to 20 inches.  The moisture control section between a depth of 8 and 20 inches is dry throughout between June and October unless irrigated and moist throughout between mid-November and mid-April.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.  It is predominantly slightly acid to neutral but the range includes moderately acid as a result of long term applications of sulfur for disease control.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 3/4, 4/3 or 3/3.  Clay content in the textural control section is 15 to 18 percent but ranges up to 20 percent in the lower B horizons.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3 or 4/2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or coarse sandy loam."

The soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock sources.  Climate is subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool, moist foggy winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 61 degrees F.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F and average July temperature is 77 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."
