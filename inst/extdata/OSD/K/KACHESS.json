  "OVERVIEW": "The Kachess series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in ablation glacial till over glacialfluvial deposits and an admixture of volcanic ash.  Kachess soils are on glacial valley floors and toeslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These colors do not meet the definition of spodic materials.\nThis series is very similar to the Thetis soil.  Further consideration will be given to correlation of Thetic to Kachess.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
