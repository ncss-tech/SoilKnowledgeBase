The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days during summer and fall.  Solum thickness ranges from 26 to 38 inches.  The exchange complex is dominated by amorphous material in the particle-size control section.  It has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.6 to 1.2 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of greater than 2.0 percent, and 15-bar moisture retention of 10 to 12 percent.  Thickness of the spodic horizon ranges from 1 to 4 inches.\nThe E horizon as a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and a chroma of 1 or 2 dry.  It is massive or single grain.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 or 6 dry.  It averages 15 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is strongly acid or modertely acid.\nThe Bw1 horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry.  It averages 15 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw2 and Bw3 horizons have a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is very gravelly ashy loam or very cobbly ashy loam.  It averages 25 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C and 3C horizons have a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, average 45 to 55 percent gravel and 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and are strongly acid or moderately acid.  The 2C horizon is extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam or extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam."

Vabus and Waptus soils have densic materials at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Polallie soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Gilpar soils have a dry value of 6 in the BC horizon and are dominated by angular andesite and pyroclastic rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lemah soils have a spodic horizon 1 to 3 inches thick.  Ronsel soils have a solum thickness of 8 to 26 inches and a spodic horizon 4 to 8 inches thick and are dominated by angular serpentinized basalt rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Thetis soils are dry 15 to 30 days in the moisture control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kachess soils are on glacial valley floors and toeslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 25 percent.  They formed in ablation glacial till over glacial-fluvial deposits with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,100 to 3,200 feet.  The soils are in a marine influenced climate with relatively cool dry summers and cool wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F; and the average July temperature is about 61 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 130 to 170 days."

These colors do not meet the definition of spodic materials.\nThis series is very similar to the Thetis soil.  Further consideration will be given to correlation of Thetic to Kachess.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
