  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kleinschmidt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that have extremely cobbly loamy sand at depths of 30 to 48 inches.  These soils formed in alluvium and are on alluvial fans, flood plains, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
