  "OVERVIEW": "The Keowns series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mostly loamy and fine sandy calcareous outwash or lacustrine deposits on glacial lake basins and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
