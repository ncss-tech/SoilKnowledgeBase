  "OVERVIEW": "The Kyway series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on foothills. These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from eolian materials, volcanic ash and rhyolite. Kyway soils have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
