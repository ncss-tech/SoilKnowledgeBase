  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness corresponds to the depth to hard fractured limestone and typically is 28 to 36 inches but ranges from 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon typically is black (10YR 2/1) but ranges to very dark gray (10YR 3/1) and very dark brown (10YR 2/2) in the lower part.  It typically is silt loam or loam, but silty clay loam is not excluded.  Sand content ranges from about 15 to 35 percent.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Where chroma exceeds 2, there are coatings on peds or mottles with chroma of 2 and value of 4 or more.  Mottles range from few to common and have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The BA horizon commonly is clay loam but ranges to loam.  Coatings on peds where present have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.\nEither mottles, coatings on peds, or matrix colors have value of 4 or 5 and chroma  of 2 in the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The upper part of the Bw horizon is clay loam or loam, averaging between 24 and 29 percent clay.  The lower part of the Bw horizon ranges from sandy loam to loam or clay loam.  The control section averages between 25 and 45 percent fine sand or coarser.\nA 2BC horizon, less than 6 inches thick, is in some pedons.  It ranges from gravelly sand to loamy sand and commonly has 10 to 30 percent pebbles and cobbles.  In some pedons, a small amount of fractured limestone is interbedded with the finer textured material in the lower part of the solum."

Crippin, Floyd, Fostoria, Merton, Nicollet, Ottosen, Readlyn, Snider, and Wilmonton soils lack limestone bedrock within depths of 40 inches and formed in about 4 feet of loamy material.  Cylinder and Lawler soils are underlain by sand and gravel at a depth of less than 40 inches.  Jacwin soils have more clay in the lower part of the Bw horizon.  Rockton soils lack 2 chroma colors in the upper part of the Bw horizon."
