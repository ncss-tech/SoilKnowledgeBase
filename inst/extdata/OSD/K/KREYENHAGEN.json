  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact are 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 5 and 16 inches is usually moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30.  It is usually dry in all parts from July 1 to September 1.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2 or 4/3.  Clay content is 20 to 27 percent.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2 or 4/3.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with clay content averaging 30 to 35 percent and is estimated to be 5 to 9 percent more than the A horizon.  Clay films are few to continuous, thin or moderately thick in tubular pores or on peds.  The fine-earth fraction has by weight less than 11 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Tehama soils have a medium or strongly acid A horizon and lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches.  Arbuckle, Blasingame, Borden, Bressa, Esparto, Fallbrook, Montpellier, Ramona, Sesame, Snelling, Tivy, Wasioja, and Wyman soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section."

The soils formed in material weathered from weakly cemented noncalcareous sandstone.  Elevations are 1,100 to 2,600 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is 78 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.  Frost-free season varies from 210 to 240 days."
