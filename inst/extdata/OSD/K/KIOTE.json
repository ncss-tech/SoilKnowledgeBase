Rolldown soils have mollic epipedons that are 25 to 40 cm thick and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of more than 152 cm.  Sawfork soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have an ustic moisture regime.  Trespass soils have thicker mollic epipedons and have aquic conditions within 1 meter of the soil surface.  Tusel soils are deep to lithic contacts and have 40 to 60 percent sand and 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kiote soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on planar to concave backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,378 to 3,300 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
