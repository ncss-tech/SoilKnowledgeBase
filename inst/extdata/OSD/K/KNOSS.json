  "OVERVIEW": "The Knoss series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Knoss soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
