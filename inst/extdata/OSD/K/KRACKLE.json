Decram soils have cambic horizons and 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Foxmount and Rockabin soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Middlehill soils have 5 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Krackle soils are on mountains. They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from igneous rocks. The main parent material is also influenced by deposits of loess derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,960  meters, The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 300 to 400 mm, but ranges to 1000 mm at highest elevations such as the summit of Steens Mountain. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Hackwood soils are very deep and have thick mollic epipedons. Felcher soils have ochric epipedons, cambic horizons, and a mesic temperature regime."
