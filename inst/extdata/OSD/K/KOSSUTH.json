  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The moderately fine textured sediments are 24 to 40 inches thick.  Thickness of the solum typically is 30 to 50 inches, but it is as thin as 26 inches in some pedons.  The depth to free carbonates is about the same as the thickness of the solum.  The moderately fine textured sediments average 30 to 40 percent clay and 10 to 25 percent sand, much of which is very fine or fine.  Gravel size or larger fragments are lacking or are rare in this part of the solum. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages about 32 to 35 percent clay. The mollic epipedon typically is 20 to 24 inches thick but is as thin as 16 inches in some pedons.\nThe Ap and A horizons are black (10YR 2/1).  The AB horizon is black (10YR 2/1) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1 or 5Y 3/1) but commonly has some lighter-colored peds.  The A horizon typically is silty clay loam with 35 to 40 percent clay, but thin horizons of silty clay with up to about 42 percent clay are within the range.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nA BA horizon up to about 10 inches thick is in some pedons instead of an AB horizon.  The BA horizon is dominantly very dark gray (10YR 3/1 or 5Y 3/1) or dark gray (10YR 4/1 or 5Y 4/1).  The Bt horizon has values of 3 or 4 in the upper part.  The value increases to 5 in the 2Bg horizon.  Values of 3 or darker do not extend below 24 inches except as discontinuous coats on faces of peds.  Hues are 5Y or 2.5Y and chromas are 1 or 2 in the Bt and 2Bg horizons.  Mottles range from 7.5YR to 5Y hue with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8 and are few to many.  Clay films are in some pedons and are typically thin and discontinuous.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the Bt horizon and neutral or mildly alkaline in the 2Bg horizon.\nColors of the 2BCg and 2Cg horizons are similar to those of the 2Bg horizon except some pedons have chroma of 3 and value as high as 6 in part of the matrix."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clyde, Colwood, Faxon, Gansner, Letri, Reddick, Selma, Tripoli, Webster, and Wolcott soils in the same family and the Marna and Waldorf soils.  Clyde, Letri, Tripoli, and Wolcott soils have firm glacial till C horizons.  Also, Clyde soils are leached of carbonates to depths of 45 to 70 inches and contain coarse fragments in the upper material; Letri soils commonly have a stone line between the two parent materials and contain less clay in the control section; Tripoli soils have thinner upper sediments and have a stone line between the two parent materials; and Wolcott soils are very poorly drained, have a thicker solum, and have a higher content of sand in the upper sediments.  Colwood soils have a lower content of clay in the upper part of the solum and have stratified B and C horizons.  Faxon soils are underlain by limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Gansner soils, formed in alluvium, are at higher elevations, and receive more precipitation.  Reddick soils have less clay in the solum and overlie moderately fine or fine textured, firm till or lake-bed sediments. Selma soils have less clay in the solum and have coarse-textured C horizons.  Webster soils average 4 to 8 percent less clay in the upper part of the solum and lack a distinct break in parent materials.  Marna and Waldorf soils are in fine families."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kossuth soils typically are on plane or concave slopes of the relatively undissected Late Wisconsin till plain.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Kossuth soils formed in moderately fine textured glacial or lacustrine sediments, typically silty clay loam, and in the underlying friable glacial till or sediments of loam texture.  The landscape tends to be level or nearly level instead of undulating as in typical ground moraines.  Knobs of well drained soils and depressions with very poorly drained soils are absent or are less numerous and less distinct.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 32 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bode, Canisteo, Nicollet, and Ottosen and the competing Webster soils.  Bode soils are on higher topographic positions and are well drained.  Canisteo and Webster soils are on similar elevations on the landscape.  Canisteo soils have free carbonates throughout the solum.  Nicollet and Ottosen soils are on slightly higher topographic positions and are somewhat poorly drained."
