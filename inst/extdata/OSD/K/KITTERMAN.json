    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kitterman soils are on scarps and benches of hills underlain with shale interbedded with sandstone. They formed in residuum from shale that can be capped by up to 10 inches of loess. The shale is dominantly from the Mississippian-age. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adyeville, Apalona, Deuchars, Ebal, and Wellston soils. The somewhat excessively drained, moderately deep Adyeville soils have less clay and are on more sloping backslopes. The moderately well drained Apalona soils have a fragipan and are commonly on summits and shoulders of hills. The very deep, moderately well drained Ebal and the very deep, moderately well drained Deuchars soils are on similar landform positions as the Kitterman soils. The well drained, deep Wellston soils are on shoulders and backslopes on higher lying hills."

Permeability is slow. The potential for surface water runoff is medium or high. Depth to an intermittent, perched high water table is at 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) from December through April in most years."
