Kent soils are moderately well drained and have argillic horizons averaging 45 to 60 percent clay. McBride soils are fine-loamy and have fragipans. Selkirk soils are somewhat poorly drained and have 45 to 60 percent clay. The somewhat poorly drained Twinning soils are fine-loamy. Menominee soils are on nearby slight rises on ground moraines or along old drainageways or old beach lines. Menominee soils have sandy upper horizons."
