The moderately well drained Nester soils and the poorly drained Sims soils are in the same drainage sequence. Kent, McBride, Selkirk, and Twining soils are on nearby ground moraines. Kent soils are moderately well drained and have argillic horizons averaging 45 to 60 percent clay. McBride soils are fine-loamy and have fragipans. Selkirk soils are somewhat poorly drained and have 45 to 60 percent clay. The somewhat poorly drained Twinning soils are fine-loamy. Menominee soils are on nearby slight rises on ground moraines or along old drainageways or old beach lines. Menominee soils have sandy upper horizons."
