The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 11 to 34 inches or to a lithic contact, if less than 34 inches deep, is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1, and is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages from 20 to 28 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4; or 7.5YR 5/4. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4 or 4/6.  Gravel content is 15 to 50 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3 or 8/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4 or 7.5YR 4/6.  It is loam or clay loam and is very or extremely gravelly.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 20 percent.

Elevation ranges from 200 to 2,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and cool foggy summers.  A moderate coastal fog influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 50 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 50 degrees F; mean July temperature is 60 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 220 to 320 days."
