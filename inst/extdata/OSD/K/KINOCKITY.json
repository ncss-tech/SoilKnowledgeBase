  "OVERVIEW": "The Kinockity series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granite.  Kinockity soils are on pediments, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
