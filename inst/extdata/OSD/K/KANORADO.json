  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanorado series consists of deep well drained soils that formed in loess over residuum weathered from calcareous shale.  Kanorado soils are on uplands and side slopes to major drainages.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.) at the type location.",
