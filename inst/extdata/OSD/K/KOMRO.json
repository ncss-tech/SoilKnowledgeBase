  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. The particle-size and series control sections average a total of 25 to 65 percent medium, coarse and very coarse sand; 15 to 35 percent coarse and very coarse sand; and less than 50 percent fine sand or very fine sand.  Volume of gravel typically ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil but ranges to 35 percent in individual subhorizons in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Redox features occur within 72 inches. Saturation occurs at 40 to 72 inches for some time in most years.\nThe Ap and A horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is typically sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand but subhorizons in some pedons are the gravelly analogs. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, or it is multicolored.  It is sand or coarse sand but subhorizons in some pedons are the gravelly analogs.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

None of these soils, except Lasa and Zumbro have redox features or a water table within the series control section.  Lasa soils average more than 50 percent fine sand and less than 5 percent medium sand in the series control section. Zumbro soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick and have free carbonates within the series control section."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1000 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: (Lab data from associated soils indicates that Komro soils have base saturation of 50 percent or more (by NH4OAc) in all horizons between the mineral soil surface and a depth of 180 cm.  However, it is suspected that the very low CEC in the sandy outwash results in drastic changes in base saturation with the addition of few bases from fertilization in cropland areas.  These soils may be Inceptisols in their natural state.)  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:  mollic epipedon - 0 to 14 inches (Ap, A); wetness feature - redox features and saturation at 40 to 72 inches at some time in most years.\nPrior to 1994, this soil was mapped Sparta Variant or Sparta moderately well drained phase.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0577\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
