  "OVERVIEW": "The Kinzie series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in loess and alluvium. Kinzie soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent. Permeability is slow. The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
