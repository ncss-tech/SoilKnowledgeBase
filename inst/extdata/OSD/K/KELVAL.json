  "OVERVIEW": "The Kelval series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium weathered mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
