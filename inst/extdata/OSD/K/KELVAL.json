The soils formed in alluvium weathered mainly from granitic rocks but some volcanic and metasedimentary rocks are included.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and mild moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  The mean January temperature is 42 degrees F., mean July temperature is 77 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 175 to 230 days."
