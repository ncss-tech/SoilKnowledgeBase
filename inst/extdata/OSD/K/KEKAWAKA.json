The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from February 25 to December 25 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from March 25 to November 25.  The soil moisture control section (7 to 17 inches) is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 1 and is moist in all parts from December 15 to May 15.  The particle-size control section (9 to 29 inches) averages from 35 to 55 percent clay.  Reaction of the solum is slightly to strongly acid.  Base saturation (sum of cations) ranges from 35 to 70 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4; 5YR 5/6, or 6/6 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 5YR 3/4 or 3/6.  Only the upper 1 to 4 inches have moist values or chromas of 3 or less.  It is loam or gravelly loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/6, 6/6, 7/6; 5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8 6/6, or 2.5YR 4/6 and moist color of 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6, 5/8; 2.5YR 3/6, or 4/6.  It is clay loam, clay, or their gravelly equivalents, with 27 to 55 percent clay.  Clay content averages greater than 35 percent in the upper 20 inches of the horizon and increases with depth.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 15 percent to a depth of 40 inches."
