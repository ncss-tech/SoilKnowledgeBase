  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenspur series comprises moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained Gray Wooded soils developing in fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam alluvium in valleys of the Northern Rocky Mountains.  The alluvium has its source largely from siliceous and metamorphosed sedimentary rocks.  The usual horizon sequence of the Kenspur soil profile is a thin horizon of conifer litter and grass leaves, a thin very dark colored A1 horizon, a moderately thick, light gray A2 horizon having a very irregular lower boundary into a grayish brown B2 horizon that has very little more clay than the A2 horizon, and a substrata of stratified loam and sand.  The Kenspur series is distinguished from the Birch, Swims and Walters series, Gray Wooded soils intergrading to Alluvial soils, by the mottled B and C or D horizons, indicating somewhat poor drainage in the Kenspur series.  Its B2 horizon is less distinct than in the Stryker series that is a Gray Wooded soil developed in deep silty materials.  The Kenspur series has evident horizonation of the Gray Wooded soil profile that is not present in the darker colored soils of the Chamokane and the Slocum series that are Alluvial soils.  The Kenspur series is moderately extensive and is locally important in agriculture and timber production.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The weakly developed Gray Wooded profile of the Kenspur series is developed in fine sandy loam to silt loam textures underlain by stratified loamy and sand alluvium at moderate or greater depths.  Evident horizonation of the Gray Wooded soil profile ranges from a distinct A2 horizon 10 or 15 inches thick to a thin A2 horizon four inches thick with an equally thick A1 horizon.  The B2 horizon is discernable by its stronger chroma and may have thin clay films on walls of root channels and pores.  Color of the Ap horizon ranges in Munsell values of 5 dry and 3 moist or greater.  Included soils in shallow swales have thicker A1 horizons and range to poorly drained."
