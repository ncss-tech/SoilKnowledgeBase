  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The weakly developed Gray Wooded profile of the Kenspur series is developed in fine sandy loam to silt loam textures underlain by stratified loamy and sand alluvium at moderate or greater depths.  Evident horizonation of the Gray Wooded soil profile ranges from a distinct A2 horizon 10 or 15 inches thick to a thin A2 horizon four inches thick with an equally thick A1 horizon.  The B2 horizon is discernable by its stronger chroma and may have thin clay films on walls of root channels and pores.  Color of the Ap horizon ranges in Munsell values of 5 dry and 3 moist or greater.  Included soils in shallow swales have thicker A1 horizons and range to poorly drained."

Last revised by state on 3/62.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive Aquic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive Aquic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
