  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Keese series consists of well drained shallow soils to bedrock that formed in residuum weathered from granite, granite grus, or gneiss of pre-Cambrian age.  These gently sloping to steep soils are on shoulders, summits and backslopes of ridges and hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
