  "OVERVIEW": "The Kootenai series consists of very deep, well drained soils on recessional moraines, outwash plains, terraces, and terrace escarpments. They formed in glacial outwash material derived dominantly from granite, gneiss, and schist with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid below. Slopes range from 0 to 55 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
