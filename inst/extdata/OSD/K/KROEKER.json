  "OVERVIEW": "The Kroeker series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium and/or eolian deposits of Holocene age over the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These soils occur on very gently sloping to moderately sloping treads of terraces and terrace remnants and on hillslopes of the dissected high plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 14.4 degrees C (58 degrees F).",
