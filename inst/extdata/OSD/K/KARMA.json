  "OVERVIEW": "The Karma series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments on stream terraces of Pleistocene age in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B) and Arkansas Valley and Ridges (MLRA 118A and 118B).  These soils are on broad level through moderately steep terraces.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range up to 20 percent.",

Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is less than 7 inches thick in pedons where the value is 3 and the chroma is 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam, and the clay content ranges from 24 to 35 percent.\nThe BC horizon is similar in color to the B2t horizon.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nIn some pedons, a C horizon occurs and has colors similar to the Bt horizon.  It is stratified and textures range from loamy fine sand to sandy clay loam."

Larton soils are on higher terraces or the outer edge of the same terrace and have B3 horizons that do not decrease more than 20 percent in clay content from the maximum in the B2t horizons and have A horizons more than 20 inches thick. Okay soils are on the back part of the terraces.  Redport and Ships soils are usually on lower terraces.  Okay and Ships soils have a mollic epipedon.  Redport soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Ships soils are clayey."

These soils differ from Teller soils by lacking a mollic epipedon and having a udic moisture regime.\nSoil Interpretation Record:  Series    OK0125\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Ap horizon). Argillic horizon - The zone from 11 inches to a depth of 52 inches (Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
