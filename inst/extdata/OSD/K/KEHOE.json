  "OVERVIEW": "The Kehoe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from soft sandstone.  Kehoe soils are in hills and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil  temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  and the soil temperature is usually not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is less than 9 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is usually moist in all parts from mid-November to mid-June.  It is dry in some or all part of the rest of the time, but is not dry in in all parts for 45 consecutive days.  Organic matter is more than 1 percent to depth of 30 inches.  The soil is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.  Clay averages 18 to 25 percent in the particle size control section.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1, 3/1, 4/2, 3/2 or 3/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 2/1 or 2/2.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 7/3, 6/2 or 6/3and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam and is massive or has weak fine subangular blocky structure."
