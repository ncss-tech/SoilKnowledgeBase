  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Klacking series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy deposits on outwash plains, kames, kame moraines, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
