  "OVERVIEW": "The Keechelus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from Teanaway basalt, breccia, and pyroclastic rocks mixed with clay deposits with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Keechelus soils are on mountain side slopes, benches and summits. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The upper 0 to 6 inches is influenced by volcanic ash. The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent clay by weight in the fine earth fraction and does not decrease by as much as 20 percent from maximum within 60 inches from the soil surface. Base saturation (by sum of the cations) is estimated to range from 50 to 75 percent throughout the upper 30 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Texture is stony ashy loam, cobbly ashy sandy loam or cobbly ashy loam. Some pedons have an AB horizon. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry or moist. Texture is gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay, or very gravelly clay. It has 15 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 40 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 4 or 6 dry or moist. Texture is very cobbly clay, very cobbly clay loam, or very gravelly clay. It has 10 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 40 percent cobbles Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt3 and Bt4 horizons have a hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry or moist. Texture is gravelly clay, very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay, very cobbly clay, or extremely gravelly clay. It has 10 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles.

They formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, breccia, and pyroclastics mixed with clay deposits with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevation is 2,500 to 5,400 feet. These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."

Hakker soils have a mollic epipedon and are in swales and depressions. Kafing soils are fine-loamy lack an argillic horizon and have 5 to 10 percent hard siltstone fragments and 30 to 90 percent soft siltstone fragments in the particle-size control section. Nard soils are fine-loamy. Sapkin soils have a mollic epipedon and have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Standup soils are loamy-skeletal lack an argillic horizon and have 40 to 70 percent rhyolite fragments in the particle-size control section."
