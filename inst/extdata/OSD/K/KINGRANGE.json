These soils formed in residuum derived from metasedimentary rocks. The climate is sub humid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days."
