  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kurk soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and slightly concave upland depressions near drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in 2 to 5 feet of silty alluvium over loess. Loamy Coastal Plain sediments may occur below the series control section. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Adaton, Center, Collins, Deanburg, Falaya, Grenada, Lexington, Loring, Providence, Routon, and Smithdale series. Adaton and Routon soils are poorly drained. Center soils are moderately well drained and are on similar positions. Collins and Falaya soils lack argillic horizons and occur on adjacent flood plains. Deanburg soils are well drained and are on higher terrace positions. Grenada, Loring, and Providence soils contain fragipans and occur on higher upland positions. Lexington and Smithdale soils are well drained and occur on higher upland positions."
