  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 58 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 78 degrees F.  The surface 15 inches has approximately .8 percent organic matter and the sand/clay ratio ranges from 1 to about 3.  The particle-size control section is typically loam, sandy clay loam, or light clay loam, and less commonly in the lower part a fine sandy loam.  It has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 15 to 60 percent sand, with more than 15 percent but less than 45 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments are typically less than 10 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent.  Exchangeable sodium percentage is usually less than 3 and is less than 15 in any layer as thick as 4 inches.  This soil is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than one-half the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. (225 to 235 days) and is not dry for 45 consecutive days following July 15.\nA horizon\nHue: 5Y through 7.5YR\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist\nChroma: 2 through 4\nStructure: granular structure, but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.\nConsistence: soft to slightly hard\nCarbonates: In some pedons it is leached to depths of 2 to 8 inches.\nReaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline (pH 7.6 to 8.2)\nWhen the surface horizons have value as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist they contain less than 1 percent organic carbon, or they are thin enough that if mixed to depth of 7 inches the soil has an ochric epipedon.\nC horizon:\nHue: 5Y through 7.5YR\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist\nChroma: 2 through 6\nReaction: moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6)\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 14 percent\nCalcium carbonate: soft masses occurs at any depths in this horizon, but it should not be concentrated into a consistent horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation."

Shavano, Sixmile, Thedalund, and Theedle soils have bedrock at some point above a depth of 40 inches.  El Rancho, Neville, and Pojoaque soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Kishona soils have cooler annual soil temperature and have moisture control sections that are dry more than one-half the time, cumulative, that the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  Kishona soils are also dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days following July 16.  Mikim and Paradox soils are dry in some parts of the moisture control section for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  In addition, Paradox soils have hues of 5YR and redder.  Tsosie soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section from April 15 to July 1."
