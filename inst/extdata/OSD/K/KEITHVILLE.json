  "REVDATE": "09/1999",
  "STATES": "LA,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Keithville series consists of deep, moderately well drained,\nvery slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy over clayey sediment of Tertiary Age.  These soils are on broad nearly level or gently sloping uplands of the coastal plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Keithville soils are saturated above the clayey layers to a depth of 2 to 3 feet below the surface for intermittent periods totaling 2 to 6 weeks during winter and early spring.",

Except for surface horizons that have been limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid through medium acid throughout the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value that ranges from 3 to 6, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has dominant hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The Bt3 horizon, where present, may range to 10YR hue, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has few or common 1 or 2 chroma mottles.  The Bt1 and Bt2 horizons are loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Total sand content, which is dominantly very fine sand, ranges from 25 to 40 percent.  Texture of the Bt3 horizon is the same as that of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and includes clay loam.\nThe Bt part of the B/E horizon is mottled in hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  The E part of the B/E horizon is a grayish coated silt or very fine sand.\nThe 2Bt horizon is mottled with shades of gray, red, and brown.

Abita, Evangeline, Freestone, and Glenmora soils lack clayey 2Bt horizons.  Freestone soils also have a fine-loamy control section.  Izagora soils have a fine-loamy over clayey control section and lack interfingering of albic material in the Bt horizon.  Kolin soils have less than 25 percent total sand in the argillic horizon.  Stigler soils have 10YR hue throughout the Bt horizon.  Vidrine soils have a coarse-silty over clayey control section and grayish wetness mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon."
