    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kydaka soils are on glacial outwash terraces at elevations of 10 to 660 feet. They formed in silty glacial lacustrine sediments over glacial outwash or till. These soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 75 to 120 inches with coastal fog influence from the Pacific Ocean. Average January temperature is about 39 degrees F., average July temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 180 to 220 days."

Ozette soils are moderately well drained, have an umbric epipedon, and have a densic contact bgetween 40 and 60 inches. Palix soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches. Snahopish soils are well drained, and formed in sandstone residuum and colluvium on mountainsides. Zeeka soils have aquic conditions below 12 inches."
