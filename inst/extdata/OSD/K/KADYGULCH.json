  "OVERVIEW": "The Kadygulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from coarse- and fine-grained igneous rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, escarpments, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 cm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
