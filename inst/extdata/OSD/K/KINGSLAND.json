The surface tier is dominantly hemic material but ranges to include some sapric material.\nThe subsurface tier and upper part of the bottom tier has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 1 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The color normally does not change in value and/or chroma after rubbing.  Fiber content of the Oe2 and upper part of Oe3 horizon is more than 33 percent unrubbed and 20 to 40 percent rubbed.\nThe bottom tier has hue of 10YR, values of 1 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 2.  The fiber content ranges to more than 70 percent unrubbed and more than 33 percent rubbed."

Dare, Dorovan, Dasher, and Pungo soils are dysic.  Everglades, Terra Ceia, and Torry soils have temperature regimes that are hyperthermic.  Istokpoga soils are dysic and have temperature regimes that are hyperthermic.  Suisun and Venice series have Mediterranean climate with mean annual precipitation less than 16 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kingsland soils occur in the flood plains of tributaries and major streams that are influenced by tidal action on level to depressional surfaces of the lower Coastal Plain.  They formed under very poorly drained conditions from the remains of swampy vegetation dominated by tupelo, cypress, and related non-woody, fibrous hydrophytic plants.  Elevation near the type location is about 10 feet above mean sea level.  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 71 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches."
