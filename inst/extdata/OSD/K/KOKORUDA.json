  "OVERVIEW": "The Kokoruda series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on alluvial fans, swales, drainageways and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
