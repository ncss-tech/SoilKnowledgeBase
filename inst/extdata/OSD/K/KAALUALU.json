  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kaalualu soils are on south and east slopes on the coastal upland of Mauna Loa Volcano at elevations from sea level to 305 meters (0 to 1,000 feet). The soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to very steep `a`a flows. Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 20 percent and range to 70 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava and contain much olivine sand. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 380 to 760 millimeters (15 to 30 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2290 meters (80 to 90 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 22 to 24 degrees C (72 to 76 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
