    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil moisture control section is usually moist but is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10. Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to the 3C horizon is 20 to 36 inches. The upper 14 to 24 inches of the soil is essentially nongravelly.  Rock fragments increase with depth averaging 0 to 10 percent pebbles in the upper part of the solum and 35 to 65 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the lower part of the solum and substratum.  The weighted average rock fragments in the particle-size control section is 25 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bs2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe 3C horizon is variegated but has general hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand, or very gravelly sand.  Reaction is medium acid through neutral."

Bullards soils have an isomesic temperature regime and lack a very gravelly 2Bs horizon.  Chuckanut and Squalicum soils are loamy and less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the particle-size control section.  Comar soils are 15 to 80 percent weathered pebblss by weighted average in the particle-size control section.  Nati and Sehome soils are 20 to 40 incheds deep to a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kickerville soils are on outwash terraces and outwash plains at elevations of 50 to 300 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loess, volcanic ash, and glacial outwash.  Kickerville soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from medial, mesic Andic Xerochrepts to coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods.  Characterization data are available on this pedon.  Laboratory number S81WA-073-15.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 9 inches and a spodic horizon from 9 to 32 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon, but does meet micro morphological criteria, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
