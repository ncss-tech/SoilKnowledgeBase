  "OVERVIEW": "The Killet series consists of deep, well drained soils that\nformed in colluvium weathered from igneous rock and volcanic ash.  Killet soils are on ridges and hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to\n35 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F,\nand the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",
