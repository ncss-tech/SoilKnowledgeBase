  "OVERVIEW": "Kingsiron consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in ash mixed with colluvium over colluvium from volcanic rocks. Kingsiron soils are on the backslopes and base slopes of glacial-valley walls in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 20 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 61 inches (1549 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F (5 degrees C).",
