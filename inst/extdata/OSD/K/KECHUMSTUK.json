  "OVERVIEW": "The Kechumstuk series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic matter and silty alluvium on alluvial plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 21 to 28 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.",

Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has matrix hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value from 3 to 6, and chroma from 0 to 2.  Mottles of secondary colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value from 3 to 5, and chroma from 2 to 4 may be present.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Few very thin strata of loamy fine sand or loamy very fine sandy are present in some pedons.  Buried O or A horizons are present in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value from 3 to 5, and chroma from 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Few very thin strata of loamy fine sand or loamy very fine sand are present in some pedons.  Sand and gravel may occur more than 40 inches below the top of the mineral material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kechumstuk soils are on alluvial plains in broad valleys with slopes of 2 percent or less.  They formed in silty alluvium in areas where the water table is near the surface due to groundwater discharge.  Sandy or gravelly alluvium may be present below 40 inches.  The climate is boreal continental, with short, warm summers and long, cold winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches, approximately one third of which falls as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 21 to 28 degrees F."

The soil is saturated within 10 inches of the mineral surface during most of the summer.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
