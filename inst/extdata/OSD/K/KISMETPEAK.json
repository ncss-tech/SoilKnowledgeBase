  "BYREV": "Rev. TAG-DMM-RJS",
  "REVDATE": "05/2011",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kismetpeak series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum weathered from sandstone.   These soils are on escarpments, hills, mountain slopes, pediments and structural benches.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
