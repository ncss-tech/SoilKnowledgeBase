Carlow, Chequest and Cove soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 127 centimeters (50 inches).  Fults, Marna and Titus soils have less than 30 percent clay and more than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Kalona soils average less than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Moline soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the series control section, typically have stratification and less than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the soil profile and formed in clayey lacustrine sediments and stratified loamy alluvium on low benches on flood plains. Rosedell soils have carbonates at depths of less than 71 centimeters (28 inches). Streator soils average less than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section and formed in loess or silty material and in silty clay or clay till or lakebed sediments. Waldorf soils soils have a moist bulk density less than 1.45 gm/cc in the lower part of the series control section and have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C (52 degrees F). Woodbury soils have chroma of 2 or more in the lower part of the series control section, less than 30 percent clay in the substratum and less than 813 millimeters (32 inches) mean annual precipitation."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 10 to 14 degrees C (50 degrees to 57 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches).

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. An intermittent apparent high water table is at the surface to 15 centimeters (0.5 foot) below the surface from December to April in normal years. This soil is subject to periods of frequent, brief ponding at depths up to 30 cm (1 foot) from December to May in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low or moderately low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers/sec). Permeability is very slow (0.02 to 0.06 inches per hour)."
