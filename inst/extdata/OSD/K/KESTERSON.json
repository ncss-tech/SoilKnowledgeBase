  "OVERVIEW": "The Kesterson series consist of deep, poorly drained soils with a high percentage of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil and a thick lime layer.  They are in valley basins and are formed in mixed alluvium, dominantly from granitic sources, and have slopes of less than 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are saturated with stagnant water for at least a few days.  The depth from the surface to the natric horizon (Btn1, Btn2, Btkn) ranges from 1.5 to 8 inches.  The depth to the upper boundary of the calcic horizon ranges from 15 to 33 inches. Some pedons do not have an A horizon.  The 3 to 23 inch control section averages from 28 to 32 percent clay but may range from 25 to 35 percent clay.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent.  Most profiles contain high percentages of mica.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; N 5/0 or N 6/0.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, N 3/0, N 4/0 or N 5/0.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  It is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 20 percent clay content.\nThe E horizon is 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 6/1, 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 5/1; 2.5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/2 N 3/0 or N 5/0.  There may be faint mottling in some pedons.  It is sandy loam or loam.  10 to 25 percent clay content.

Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 5Y 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 4/2, 5/2 or 6/1.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Typically the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 8 percent.  Some pedons have over 15 percent in the lower Bt horizon.  EC ranges from 2 to 6 mmhos/cm.  ESP ranges from 16 to 60.\nThe upper Bk1 horizon is 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2; or 5Y 8/1.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2, 6/2; 5Y 4/3, 5/2, 6/2 or 7/2.  The value of the color is dependent on the lime content.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 16 to 45 percent.  ESP ranges from 15 to 50.\nThe lower Bk2 horizon is 10YR 8/2; 2.5Y 8/4; or 5Y 6/3.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/2; 5Y 4/3, 5/2 or 7/2.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  ESP ranges from 5 to 20.  Durinodes range from 0 to 5 percent."

They are not ponded, due to rainfall, for periods of 7 to 21 days from December to March.  The water table is now 1 to 3 feet December through April.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with and surveyed as the Rossi series in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report.  These soils are being differentiated by characteristics that show a reducing environment (Aquic Moisture Regime) and fine-loamy control section that is not characteristic of the Rossi series.  pH determined by colorimetric using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Calcium carbonate equivalent determined by field kit.  ESP determined by saturation extract.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
