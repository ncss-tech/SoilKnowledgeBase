Potential competitors in other families are the Excello, Gielow, and Nosal series.\nArctander, Coland, Comfrey, Delft, Excello, Gielow, Glencoe, Gus, Konner, Lundlake, McClave, Peoh, Romnell, and Shandep soils do not have an aridic moisture regime.  James Canyon soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a xeric moisture regime.  Keddie soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a xeric moisture regime.  Nosal soils have horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments between 100 and 150 cm.  Roundval soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C.  Wenas soils have thick horizons of strongly contrasting sandy textures between 100 and 150 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kimmerling soils are on flood plains and swales.  The microtopography is level to slightly concave.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between within 50 cm (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence classes) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  Water tables fluctuate with irrigation on nearby higher lying soils and to some extent with fluctuation in adjacent river channels.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May."
