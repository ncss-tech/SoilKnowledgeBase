  "OVERVIEW": "The Kimmerling series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Kimmerling soils are on flood plains and swales.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  Water tables fluctuate with irrigation on nearby higher lying soils and to some extent with fluctuation in adjacent river channels.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May."
