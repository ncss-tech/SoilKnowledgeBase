    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: ochric epipedon - the one from 0 to 8 inches (A and E1 horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 4 to 17 inches (E1, E2, and Ex horizons); glossic horizon - the zone from 17 to 34 inches (B/E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 58 inches (B/E and Bt horizons); aquic subgroup - Fe depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon.. Densic contact at 58 inches. The Ex horizon exhibits fragipan characteristics and may fit the proposed fragalbic horizon.
