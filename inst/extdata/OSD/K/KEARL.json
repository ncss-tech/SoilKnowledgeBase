  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick.  The thickness of the solum and depth to carbonate accumulation range from 13 to 24 inches.  Clay in the particle-size control section ranges from 7 to 17 percent.  Soft sandstone fragments that crush under strong thumb pressure occur throughout the profile.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It commonly is loam or sandy loam and less commonly silt loam.  This horizon is 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and 3 through 6 moist.  It commonly is loam, and less commonly sandy loam.  This horizon is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  It is 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 4 through 8 moist.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  This horizon has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous."

Elevations are 6,200 to 7,500 feet.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from sandstone.  The mean annual temperature is 37 degrees to 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Freeze-free season is 55 to 80 days."
