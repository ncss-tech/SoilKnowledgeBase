  "OVERVIEW": "The Kobarter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from semiconsolidated shale and siltstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, knolls and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
