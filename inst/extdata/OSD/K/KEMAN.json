  "OVERVIEW": "The Keman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till and colluvium derived from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  Keman soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
