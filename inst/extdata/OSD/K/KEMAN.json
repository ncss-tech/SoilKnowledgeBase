Aspetill soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Badwater soils are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section. Blackbear, Bickmore, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Panin, Rangertaft, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep.  Booneville soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section, have mean summer soil temperature of 10 to 13 degrees C, and have thin O horizons.  Dab soils have mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 7 degrees C and have mollic epipedons that are 40 to 60 cm thick. Dailybasin and Igor soils have a ustic soil moisture regime. Delhew soils have less than 18 percent clay, are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Geemore soils have calcic horizons and horizons with secondary silica and average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Lostcannon soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.

Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,895 to 2,300 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 640 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 20 to 50 days."
