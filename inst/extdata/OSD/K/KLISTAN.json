    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. The particle-size control section has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter. It has greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 15 cmol/kg of KCL-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried). It is weakly or moderately smeary. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid. Hue is 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist, 2 or 3 dry. Texture is gravelly medial loam or very gravelly medial loam with clay content of 12 to 18 percent by field estimate. It has 20 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 15 percent paragravel, and 0 to 5 percent paracobbles. Organic matter content is 8 to 12 percent.\nBw and BC horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam, very cobbly medial loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam with clay content of 18 to 27 percent by field estimate. It has 20 to 70 percent gravel, 0 to 35 percent cobbles, 10 to 30 percent paragravel, and 0 to 20 percent paracobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Klistan soils occur on shoulder slopes, backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of mountains. Elevation is 200 to 2200 feet. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum from basalt and other igneous and volcanic rock types. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 220 days."

Formader and Hemcross soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Formader soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact and have a strongly contrasting particle-size class (medial over loamy). Kilchis soils are 10 to 20 inches to a lithic contact."
