  "OVERVIEW": "The Kittleson series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum primarily from pyroclastic rocks.  Polander soils are on mountainsides with slopes of 15 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are moist in the winter and spring and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nfrom about June to November (5 months).  The bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter in the fine earth fraction.  Depth to bedrock is 40 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 10 percent gravel and 10 to 18 percent clay.  The very fine sand fraction contains 50 to 70 percent glass.  It is moderately to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and 3 or 4 when dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist and 5 or 6 when dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 when moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent of which 0 to 5 percent are cobbles and 0 to 15 percent are gravel.  Rock fragments are mainly rhyolite."

Phosphorous retention is assumed to be greater than 25 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron is assumed to be greater than 0.4 percent."
