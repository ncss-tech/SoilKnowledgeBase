  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches, depth to calcareous material ranges from 6 to 20 inches, thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and C horizon, but are normally less than 5 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 58 to 79 degrees F.  The time soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F or higher ranges approximately from 230 to 305 days.  Cumulative time the soil is moist in some part of the moisture control section and the soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F or higher ranges approximately from 56 to 152 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It usually has granular primary structure but has subangular blocky structures in some pedons.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 45 percent sand.  This horizon usually has prismatic primary structure but has angular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Oriented clay films occur in some part of this horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline, and has 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth."

The soil formed in moderately thin calcareous fine textured materials weathered residually from clayey sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 67 degrees F."
