Rock fragments of subrounded quartz and sandstone, range from 5 to 70 percent in individual horizons of the solum and from 35 to 80 percent in the substratum.  Boulders, stones, and channers cover about 5 to 60 percent of the surface of some pedons. The control section averages less than 18 percent clay. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through extremely acid throughout the soil where unlimed.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak, fine to medium granular or single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Some pedons have a dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) slightly cemented Bhs horizon less than one inch thick.\nThe BC, CB or C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It ranges from loam to loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak subangular blocky, single grain or the material is massive.

Other series in related mesic families include the Berks, Blasdell, Calvin, Chenango, Dekalb, Hazleton, Lehew, Manlius, Oquaga, Tunkhannock and Wyoming soils. The Berks, Carrollton, Dekalb, Lehew, Macomber, Mandy, Manlius, Oquaga, and Vly soils have bedrock within 40 inches. Chenango, Lagross, Tunkhannock and Wyoming soils have  water-sorted sand and gravel within the series control section.  Rockrift (T) and Skytop (T) soils formed in glacial till at lower elevations. Blasdell and Manlius soils have rock fragments dominately of shale. Calvin soils formed in red residuum material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Knapp Creek soils are on ridges and summits. Slopes are usually convex with gradients from 0 to 15 percent. These soils developed in material weathered from the Olean sandstone conglomerate. The Olean formation varies from a massive conglomerate with well rounded pebbles, 0.25 to 3 inches in diameter, of milky quartz imbedded in a dark gray siliceous matrix, to a coarse quartzose sandstone containing few pebbles. The conglomerate contains a weakly cemented quartzose sandstone as a matrix. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; and the growing season ranges from is 90 to 120 days. These soils are mostly above elevations of 2,200 feet."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches ( A and E horizons).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 11 to 22 inches (Bw horizon).\nc. Loamy-skeletal feature - greater than 35 percent by volume weighted average rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
