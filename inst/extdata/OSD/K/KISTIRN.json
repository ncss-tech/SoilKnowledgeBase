The soil between the depths of 8 and 24 inches is usually dry in all parts from mid-June to mid-October and moist in all parts from November to April.  The base saturation (by Hack Kit) is 14 to 28 percent in the lower part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 5/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 7/4; 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4, 5/6; 10YR 3/3.  It is loam or silt loam with 15 to 27 percent clay, and 15 to 60 percent gravel.  It is slightly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 5/6; 7.5YR 5/6, 6/6, 6/8, 7/6, 7/8; 10YR 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6.  Moist colors are 5YR 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/6, 5/8; 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/8.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, with 27 to 35 percent clay, 30 to 60 percent gravel, and 5 to 20 percent cobbles. The Bt1 horizon has an average of 30 to 35 percent clay.  It is slightly through strongly acid.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 7/2, 7/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 6/4.  It is clay loam, clay or silty clay with 30 to 50 percent clay, and 50 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles.  It is moderately or strongly acid.  Some pedons lack C horizons."
