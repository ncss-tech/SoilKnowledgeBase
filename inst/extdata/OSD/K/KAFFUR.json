The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock such as granite or granodiorite.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nEffervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content:  10 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments:  35 to 60 percent over one-half of which are fine (2 to 5 mm diameter) gravel.\nA horizons\nHue:  10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma:  1 through 3, dry or moist.\nTexture:  Very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly coarse sandy loam."

Kzin and Weepah soils have a horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates, have 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and have paralithic materials of calcareous clastic sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kaffur soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks with additions of calcareous eolian material.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
