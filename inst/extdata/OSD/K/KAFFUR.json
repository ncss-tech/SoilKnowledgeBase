  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaffur series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks with additions of calcareous eolian material.  Kaffur soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
