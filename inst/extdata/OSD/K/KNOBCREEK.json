  "OVERVIEW": "The Knobcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thin loess and the underlying clayey residuum, and are on hills and sinkholes underlain with limestone. Slope ranges from 6 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

    "content": "REMARKS: Base saturation data for this series as of 9/99 shows pedons to be both above and below 35 percent at the critical depth. This series is tentatively placed in the Alfisol Order. Also data shows that the particle-size control section is both contrasting and non-contrasting, but dominantly contrasting.\nRepresentative component and horizon data is in DMU# 151472.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon - the zone between 0 and 18 cm (0 and 7 inches) (Ap horizon); 2) Argillic horizon - the zone between 18 and 226 cm (7 and 89 inches) (Bt and 2Bt horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data on sample number 97IN043-004 is from the NSSL in Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
