  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  These soils typically have 2 to 25 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and pebble to cobblestone in size.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days for the 120 days following the summer solstice.  It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The A horizon typically is sandy loam, but fine sandy loam is within the range.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 4 through 6, 6 through 8 dry; chroma of 2 through 4.  Typically it is sandy loam but includes fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nMost pedons have either an EB, B/E or BE transitional horizons with some characteristics of both horizons, but do not have a glossic horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It typically is sandy clay loam or sandy loam but includes fine sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent and sand content from 45 to 65 percent.  The upper part may have clean silt and sand grains on the faces of peds.  Clay films range from faint to prominent and few to continuous.  The reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe C or Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is typically sandy loam but ranges to fine sandy loam and loam.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  It commonly has calcium carbonate filaments or masses.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent."

The Belltower, Eaglecreek, Elbuck, Hoyt, Jemez, Kunz, Lobat, Shoemaker, and Tunitcha soils are dry in any or all parts of the soil moisture control section for 90 or more cumulative days in most years.  The Maitland soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon and the upper two-thirds of the series control section.  Waukon soils have less than 45 percent sand in the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kandota soils are on gently sloping to very steep convex slopes on sandy loam glacial ground and end moraines.  The slope gradients range from 1 to 40 percent.  The soils formed primarily in a coarse loamy Wadena glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches."
