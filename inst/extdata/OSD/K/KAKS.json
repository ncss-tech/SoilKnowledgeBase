Gravel content ranges from 2 to 10 percent and cobble content ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures, coarse fragment content, and reaction is similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bhs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam, or their cobbly or gravelly analogs.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 15 percent and cobble content ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bhs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand or cobbly loamy sand.
