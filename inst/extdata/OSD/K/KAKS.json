  "REVDATE": "05/2006",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaks series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial or till deposits.  These soils are found on moraines.  Permeability is moderately rapid through the subsoil and rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
