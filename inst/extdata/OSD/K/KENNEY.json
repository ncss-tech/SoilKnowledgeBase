  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenney series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on terraces in river valleys on coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1194 mm (47 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).",

This move placed the series type location in a more representative area. Due to relocation of typical pedon, the competing series and geographically associated soils sections were edited."
