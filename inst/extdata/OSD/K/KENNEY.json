This move placed the series type location in a more representative area. Due to relocation of typical pedon, the competing series and geographically associated soils sections were edited.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
