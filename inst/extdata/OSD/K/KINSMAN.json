  "OVERVIEW": "The Kinsman series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in coarse and moderately coarse textured glacial outwash. These soils are on slightly concave areas of stream terraces, kame terraces, outwash plains, and depressions at the base of glaciated upland hills. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high throughout. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
