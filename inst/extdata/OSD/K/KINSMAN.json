Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in coarse and moderately coarse textured glacial outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143mm and mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees F. The growing season ranges from 80 to 160 days."

Adams, Croghan, Groveton, and Madawaska soils are in higher positions on the landscape and lack redoximorphic features in the spodic horizon. The competing Naumburg soils are in similar landscape positions. Searsport soils are in lower positions on the landscape and have a histic epipedon. The Sunday, Ondawa, Podunk, and Rumney soils are on floodplains and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon from 25 to 125 cm below the mineral soil surface."
