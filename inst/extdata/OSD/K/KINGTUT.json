  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingtut series consists of shallow to hardpan, well drained soils formed in alluvium from rhyolite.  Kingtut soils are on mesas and plateaus.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
