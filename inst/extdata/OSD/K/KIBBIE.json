  "STATES": "MI,OH,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kibbie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains, ground moraines, outwash plains, and deltas. They formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
