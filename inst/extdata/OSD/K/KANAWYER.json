  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanawyer series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in till derived from granitic rocks. Kanawyer soils are on moraines in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
