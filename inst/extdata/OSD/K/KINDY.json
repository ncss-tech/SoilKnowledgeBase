Crinker, Hatchet, Howson, Klawatti, Polallie, and Springsteen soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Ohanna soils are cindery in the upper part of the spodic horizon and they have a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock.  Vabus and Waptus soils have a spodic horizon less than 7 inches thick and are sandy loam in the fine earth fraction in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Whetstone soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
