  "OVERVIEW": "The Kindy series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, colluvium and glacial till.  Kindy soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Crinker, Hatchet, Howson, Klawatti, Polallie, and Springsteen soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Ohanna soils are cindery in the upper part of the spodic horizon and they have a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock.  Vabus and Waptus soils have a spodic horizon less than 7 inches thick and are sandy loam in the fine earth fraction in the lower part of the particle-size control section.
