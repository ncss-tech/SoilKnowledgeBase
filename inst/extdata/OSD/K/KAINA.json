  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that form in colluvium and till derived from mixed metasedimentary rock. These soils occur on cirque platforms, cirque headwalls, glacial-valley walls and moraines.  Slopes are 30 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,475 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C.",
