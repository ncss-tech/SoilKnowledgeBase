  "OVERVIEW": "The Kickinghorse series consists of deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 40 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
