    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are the following:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - 10 to 55 inches\nAndic soil properties - 3 to 31 inches\nDensic layer - 55 to 63 inches\nPSCS - 3 to 43 inches (from 3 to 28 inches the control section is medial and ferrihydritic and from 28 to 43 inches is loamy and isotic).\nThe series would meet the criteria for Oxyaquic if such a subgroup were recognized.  Some pedons may qualify as Aquic where the depth to till is at about 40 inches.  All depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
