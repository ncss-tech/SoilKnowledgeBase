    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist and are not dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 38 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to cinders is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The solum has a phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2 to 5 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction, 25 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate and 15-bar water of 15 to 20 percent on air-dried samples.  The moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90g/cc.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent cinders in the upper part and 90 percent or more cinders in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 30 percent cinder gravel and a field estimated clay content of 5 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It contains 25 to 35 percent cinder gravel and a field estimated clay content of 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry.  It contains 80 to 100 percent cinders which are all gravel size."
