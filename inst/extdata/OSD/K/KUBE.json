  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to carbonate ranges from 16 to 30 inches.  Fragments of soft siltstone are within a depth of 36 inches and range from 10 to 35 percent by volume in horizon immediately above the siltstone (Cr horizon).  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches and extends into the Bt horizon of some pedons.  CEC/clay ratios range from 90me/100 grams to 200 me/100 grams in the solum with the highest ratios in the BCk horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam or silty clay averaging between 35 and 45 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It has few or common tongues, less than 1 inch in width, of A material extending into the Bt horizon.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.   It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has few to common accumulations of carbonate in the lower part.  Some pedons have a Bk or C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Ashfork, Blackpipe, Boquillas, Chapin, Emigrant, Huggins, Leyden, Querc, Thunderbird, and Wormser soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  In addition, Chapin and Boquillas soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the argillic horizon, and Emigrant, Querc, Thunderbird, and Wormser soils contain more sand coarser than very fine sand.  Boneek, Collbran, Loma, and Rednun soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Loma soils have carbonate throughout and Rednun soils have more sand coarser than very fine sand.  Nunn soils have more fine or coarser sand.  Richfield and Ryus soils have carbonate at or near the surface.  Savo soils have lower CEC/clay ratios.  Showlow and Standley soils have more coarse fragments.  Sofia soils have more clay.  Torreon soils have thicker sola and formed in sediments influenced by basalt."
