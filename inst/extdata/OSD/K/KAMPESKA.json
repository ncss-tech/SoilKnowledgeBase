  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches. The soil typically is calcareous throughout, but some uncultivated pedons do not have carbonates to a depth of 6 inches. The control section typically is silt loam or silty clay loam averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. Depth to sand and gravel is typically 20 to 30 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It has few or common, fine or medium accumulations of calcium carbonate.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has few to many accumulations of calcium carbonate on the underside of pebbles.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 20 percent.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loamy sand. It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Gravel content ranges from 15 to 60 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is stratified with textures of sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam and their gravelly and very gravelly modifiers. It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Gravel content ranges from 15 to 60 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kampeska soils are formed in silty material overlying sand and gravel on outwash terraces and outwash plains. These soils are on gently sloping uplands with convex surfaces. Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 48 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches. Growing season is about 120 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation from 15 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2900."

The Brandt and Estelline soils are on the lower part of the landscape and do not contain carbonates within 15 inches. In addition the Brandt soils do not have sand and gravel within 40 inches. The Goldsmith soils do not have sand and gravel within 40 inches, are in nearby swales and flats, and have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches. Fordville and Renshaw soils contain more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in all parts of the series control section and are on lower nearby landscapes. In addition the Renshaw soils have sand and gravel within 20 inches. The Kranzburg soils do not have sand and gravel within a depth of 40 inches and are on higher nearby landscapes. Mahoney soils have a lower chroma in the lower part of the Bk horizon and are on the lower part of the landscape. Sioux soils have sand and gravel within a depth of 14 inches and are on similar nearby landscapes."
