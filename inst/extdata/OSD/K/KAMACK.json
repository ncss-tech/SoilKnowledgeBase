  "OVERVIEW": "The Kamack series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Kamack soils are on dissected mountainsides and have slopes of 10 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches, and the mean summer soil temperature is 56 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral to slightly acid.\nThe Bw (cambic) horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is mainly very gravelly loam but ranges from very gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly clay loam, very channery loam and has 18 to 28 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are mainly pebbles.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."
