  "OVERVIEW": "The Kangas series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash. Kangas soils and terraces are on outwash and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
