    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 14 to 32 inches.  Depth to the carbonates ranges from 15 to 26 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, but typically are less than 5 percent.  The moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Where the surface layer has a value of 3 moist and 5 or less dry, it is too thin or the organic carbon content is too low to be a mollic epipedon.\nSome pedons have an E horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam and silt loam.  It has less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam and loam.  It has less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has 4 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.

Pulpit, Roubideau and Verde soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Sharps and Whetherhill soils have a Bt horizon with hues 7.5YR or redder.  In addition, Sharps soils occur where precipitation occurs evenly throughout the year and are above elevations of 6,200 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klinedraw soils are on backslopes, summits and shoulders of upland fan remnants, terraces, plateaus, ridges and hills.  They formed in alluvium derived from silty shale and very fine grained sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
