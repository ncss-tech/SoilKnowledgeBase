Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
