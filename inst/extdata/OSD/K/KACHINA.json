  "OVERVIEW": "The Kachina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate.  Kachina soils are on toeslopes of ridges and hills.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
