  "OVERVIEW": "The Khapo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist; granitic sandstone and mudstone; loess; and volcanic ash.  Khapo soils are on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants and treads of high stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Soil series presently classified as Ustic Haplargids or soil series with similar properties still classified as Ustollic or Ustalfic Haplargids are the Betonnie, Bijou, Gilcrest, Marjane, Neesopah, Palma, Terro, Terry, Tintero (T), Vonalee, and Windwhistle series.\nOnly the Windwhistle soil has a calcic horizon described within the series control section.  Windwhistle soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Although not recognized as such, the Bk horizons of Palma soils may possibly qualify as calcic horizons.  Palma soils are drier in the soil moisture control section between December and March and do not have significant amounts of volcanic glass."

Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.

Zepol soils are fine-silty, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent narrow flood plains of valley floors.  Zozobra soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders of erosional fan remnants."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 5 inches. (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 43 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 11 to 89 inches. (Btk1, Btk2, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, 5 to 25 inches (Bt and part of the Btk1 horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 80 inches.\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data from adjacent soils indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  It is estimated that Khapo soils have similar values and thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades."
