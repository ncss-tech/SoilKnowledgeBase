    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.   Soil series presently classified as Ustic Haplargids or soil series with similar properties still classified as Ustollic or Ustalfic Haplargids are the Betonnie, Bijou, Gilcrest, Marjane, Neesopah, Palma, Terro, Terry, Tintero (T), Vonalee, and Windwhistle series.\nOnly the Windwhistle soil has a calcic horizon described within the series control section.  Windwhistle soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Although not recognized as such, the Bk horizons of Palma soils may possibly qualify as calcic horizons.  Palma soils are drier in the soil moisture control section between December and March and do not have significant amounts of volcanic glass."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Khapo soils are on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants and treads of high stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; Tertiary granitic sandstone and mudstone; and Quaternary loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Chupe soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains of valley floors.  Panky soils are fine-loamy, have calcic horizons, and occur on adjacent summits of erosional fan remnants.  Zepol soils are fine-silty, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent narrow flood plains of valley floors.  Zozobra soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders of erosional fan remnants."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 5 inches. (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 43 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 11 to 89 inches. (Btk1, Btk2, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, 5 to 25 inches (Bt and part of the Btk1 horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 80 inches.\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data from adjacent soils indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  It is estimated that Khapo soils have similar values and thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location has been sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE as soil survey sample number S94NM-049-003.  Reference analyses such as particle-size distribution, cation exchange capacity, and optical grain counts were performed.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
