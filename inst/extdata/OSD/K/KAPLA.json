The particle-size control section has less than 30 percent medium sand or coarser.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is mucky peat or muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of  2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 5Y,  value of  3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam.  Thin strata ranging from sand to silt loam commonly occur in the lower part.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 5Y,  value of  3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is typically stratified and textures include loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  It has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations.  Concentrations are weakly to moderately cemented in some pedons.   Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kapla soils are on linear or concave surfaces of glacial lake plains and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in eolian and/or glaciolacustrine materials.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches.  The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days.  Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1400 feet."
