  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kapla series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in eolian and/or glaciolacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",
