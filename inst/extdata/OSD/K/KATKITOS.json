  "OVERVIEW": "The Katkitos series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from metasedimentary rock. These soils are on cirque platforms. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 1,475 mm, and average annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
