  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is about 4 to 6 feet and very cobbly layers are at 18 to 29 inches.  In some pedons there are indurated substrata below 40 inches.  Soil temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are dry in the moisture control section most years from about June 5 to the end of September.  The remainder of the year, the soils are moist.  The A horizons have colors in 10YR and 7.5YR hues with values of 4 or 5 dry and 3 moist.  Chromas are 2 or 3.  Texture is gravelly or cobbly loam, structure is weak or massive, and consistence is hard or slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic.   Reaction is slightly acid to medium acid.  The B2t horizons have colors in 7.5YR to 2.5YR. hues, values of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 3 or 4.  Texture is clay or sandy clay and there is more than 50 percent by volume of coarse fragments which usually are cobbles or gravels.  Structure is massive and consistence is hard or very hard, firm, very plastic and very sticky.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Corning, Gloria, Perkins, Red Bluff, Ryer, Tuscan and Yokohl series are similar.  Corning soils have red strongly acid B2t horizons and yellowish red A horizons.  Gloria, Yokohl, and Tuscan soils have duripans near 20 inches in depth.  Perkins soils have yellowish red B2t horizons that have less than 50 percent gravels and Red Bluff soils have strongly acid red, nongravelly B2t horizons.  Ryer soils have brown heavy clay loam B2t horizons that are weakly calcareous in the lower part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Keefers soils occur on gently sloping to undulating old terraces that were derived mainly from basic igneous rocks.  They occur at elevations of 200 to 1,000 feet, in a moist subhumid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 23 to 40 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 82 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages about 230 to 280 days."
