  "OVERVIEW": "The Kolokolo series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from basic igneous rock. Kolokolo soils are on stream bottoms and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual rainfall is about 2670 mm (105 in) and mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).",
