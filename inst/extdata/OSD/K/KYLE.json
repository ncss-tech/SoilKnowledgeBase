  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil typically does not have carbonates to depths of 4 to 6 inches, but some pedons contain carbonates to the surface.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 inch to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  The control section averages 60 to 65 percent clay.  The soil does not have a mollic epipedon but the upper 10 inches of the solum has an average organic carbon content between 0.6 and 1.7 percent.  When the soil is dry, a porous surface crust 1/8 inch to 1/2 inch thick with dry color value of 6 or 7 is typical.  Gypsum and other salts are below depths of 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is clay but some is silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw and Bss horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Both dry and moist colors of the surface of peds range from 1/2 to 1 value darker than the crushed peds.  They are extremely hard or very hard when dry and extremely firm or very firm when moist.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BCss horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has few to common accumulations of gypsum and other salts in most pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon that has colors similar to the BC horizon.   It has few to common accumulations of carbonate.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cy horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay and some pedons contain up to 35 percent fragments of shale below 40 inches.  It has few to many accumulations of gypsum or other salts.  Unweathered shale typically is at depths greater than 5 feet but is as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the McNary, Twotop and Wasa series.  McNary soils occur above elevations of 6000 feet and do not have visible gypsum below depths of 20 inches.  Twotop soils have salts between 10 and 20 inches and a weaker grade and coarser structure at the surface.  Wasa soils have bedded shale within depths of 40 inches and salts within 8 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kyle soils are nearly level to strongly sloping on uplands and colluvial fans.  Slopes are plane to convex, and slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  Gilgai microrelief is in most areas.  The soil formed in clayey sediments weathered from calcareous clay shale.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 12 to 19 inches."

Twotop, Wasa and Winler soils are on similar landscapes below the Kyle soils.  Pierre soils are on landscapes above the Kyle soils.  Pierre and Winler soils have bedded shale within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, Winler soils have less carbonates and have a weaker grade of structure in the surface.  Hisle soils are on similar landscapes with microrelief and have a natric horizon.  The Lismas and Samsil soils are on steeper landscapes and have shale within depths of 20 inches.  Swanboy soils are on fans and flats.  They have salts within 10 inches of the dispersed surface."
