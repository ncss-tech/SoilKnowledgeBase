  "OVERVIEW": "The Keysto series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed fan alluvium and stream alluvium.  Keysto soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
