Carey Lake soils have relict mottles in the lower part of the profile. Dunford soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 inches). Hades soils have an A horizon more than 50 cm (20 inches) thick and are moderately acid through neutral.  Hurryback soils are neutral in the Bt horizon. Lagnaf soils have more than 20 percent rock fragments within the control section.  Mahogan soils have bedrock at 75 to 100 cm (30 to 40 inches). Marotz soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments within the control section. Moffspring soils have argillic horizons that are less than 40 cm (15 inches) thick. Nagle soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during summer and early fall. Needapepper soils are usually dry July through early October and have argillic horizons that extend beyond 152 centimeters. Sag soils have bedrock at 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 inches) and can have up to 25 percent rock fragments in the upper Bt horizon. Strom soils have mottles at a depth of 75 to 113 cm (30 to 45 inches) and are somewhat poorly drained. Tusk soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon."
