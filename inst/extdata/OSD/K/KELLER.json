  "OVERVIEW": "The Keller series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands. They formed in 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm) of loess and the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 2Bt or 2Btg horizon of the Keller soils is the lower part of a modern solum superimposed upon a Sangamon paleosol in the Illinoian and Pre-Illinioan till. Many of the properties of those horizons are believed to have been inherited from the paleosol. The variability of the properties is related to the geologic truncation of the paleosol before it was buried by loess, and to the extent of modern soil development in the old materials. Calcium and other bases have been replenished through seepage in some pedons after burial by loess. It is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the modern solum from those of the paleosol in many pedons. Some pedons contain a thin layer of loamy pedisediment between the loess and the till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 48 cm (19 inches), (Ap, A, and BA horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 48 to 155 cm (19 to 61 inches), (Btg1, 2Btg2, 2Btg3, and 2Btg4)."
