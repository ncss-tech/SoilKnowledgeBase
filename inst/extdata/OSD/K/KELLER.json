  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Keller soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep parts of dissected Illinoian and Pre-Illinoian till plains. Slope gradients are 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Mean annual temperature varies from 10.0 to 13.9 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation varies from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches), frost free days ranges from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 122 to 305 meters (400 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

Fishhook soils lack a mollic epipedon and are the light colored member of a biosequence with Keller soils. They are on similar parts of the landform positions nearby. Harrison, Ipava, and Tama soils averages less 30 percent clay in the lower one-half of the particle size control section and are upslope on higher side slopes or crests of summits on the landform position. Velma soils are on side slope positions downslope of the Keller soils. They contain more than 15 percent sand in the particle-size control section and less than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the particle-size control section."

The potential for surface runoff is medium to high. Concave areas near the heads of drainageways receive water from seepage or surface runoff from upslope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the till. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour) in the loess and slow (0.06 to 0.2 inches per hour) in the till."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 2Bt or 2Btg horizon of the Keller soils is the lower part of a modern solum superimposed upon a Sangamon paleosol in the Illinoian and Pre-Illinioan till. Many of the properties of those horizons are believed to have been inherited from the paleosol. The variability of the properties is related to the geologic truncation of the paleosol before it was buried by loess, and to the extent of modern soil development in the old materials. Calcium and other bases have been replenished through seepage in some pedons after burial by loess. It is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the modern solum from those of the paleosol in many pedons. Some pedons contain a thin layer of loamy pedisediment between the loess and the till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 48 cm (19 inches), (Ap, A, and BA horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 48 to 155 cm (19 to 61 inches), (Btg1, 2Btg2, 2Btg3, and 2Btg4).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data are on file at the NRCS MLRA Office Regional 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
