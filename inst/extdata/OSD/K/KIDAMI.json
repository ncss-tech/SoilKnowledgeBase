The BE or EB horizon, where present, has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. The E, EB, or BE horizons are silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe second part of the series control section (Bt or 2Bt horizon) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is dominantly clay loam or loam, but ranges to silty clay loam in the upper part where the silt cap is at the maximum thickness. The clay content ranges from 18 to 34 percent. Sand content is 15 to 45 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe third part of the series control section (Bt, 2Bt, BC, 2BC, Bk, or 2Bk horizon) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have redoximorphic features.\nTexture is loam. The clay content ranges from 17 to 27 percent. The sand content is 30 to 45 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to\n30 percent.\nThe lower part of the series control section (C and/or 2C horizon) has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have redoximorphic features. It is loam or sandy loam. The clay content ranges from 15 to 20 percent. Sand content is 35 to 60 percent. Very fine sand content averages more than 10 percent. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 25 to 40 percent."

Kidami soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of silty material and in loamy till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches (762 to 1016 mm), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and the elevation ranges from 189 to 311 meters (620 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

An intermittent perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) below the surface at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low on the gentle slopes and medium on the steeper slopes.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum, and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying material.\nPermeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped Miami in McHenry County. Through MLRA update activities these areas were determined to have moderately slow permeability whereas the Miami series has slow or very slow permeability in the underlying dense basal till. Water table data indicates that this soil has a perched water table at a depth of 51 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) in late winter and in early spring.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 25 cm (10 inches) (A, E, and BE horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 25 to 114 cm (10 to 45 inches) (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons); discontinuity at a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) - the contact between the BE and 2Bt1 horizons; udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
