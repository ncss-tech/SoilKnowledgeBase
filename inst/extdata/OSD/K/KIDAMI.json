Through MLRA update activities these areas were determined to have moderately slow permeability whereas the Miami series has slow or very slow permeability in the underlying dense basal till. Water table data indicates that this soil has a perched water table at a depth of 51 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) in late winter and in early spring.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 25 cm (10 inches) (A, E, and BE horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 25 to 114 cm (10 to 45 inches) (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons); discontinuity at a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) - the contact between the BE and 2Bt1 horizons; udic moisture regime."
