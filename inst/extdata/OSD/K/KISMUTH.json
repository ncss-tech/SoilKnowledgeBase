  "OVERVIEW": "The Kismuth series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granite, granodiorite, granodiorite gneiss, or quartz monzonite.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
