The soils formed in moderately fine and fine textured materials from mixed igneous parent rock.  The solum appears to have had some influence from basic igneous rocks whereas the 2Ck horizon and underlying material appear derived from acid igneous rocks.  The climate is semiarid continental.  At the type location the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is about 14."
