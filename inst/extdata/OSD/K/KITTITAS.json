These soils are saturated with water part of each year and are continuously moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick and has more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Coarse fragments in the particle-size control section range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It has moderate platy or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is very strongly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  They are silt loam or light silty clay loam above a depth of 40 inches and ranges from silty clay loam to fine sandy loam below 40 inches.  These horizons are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Thin sandy loam strata are in some pedons."
