  "OVERVIEW": "The Klipstein series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic and sedimentary rock.  Klipstein soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
