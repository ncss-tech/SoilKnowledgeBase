Blackmagic and Pochie soils average 5 to 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. Cornville, Dona Ana, Madurez and Tres Hermanos soils are moist in the control section for more than 20 days in the summer. Jagerson soils have a calcic horizon that occurs below the argillic horizon. Madurez soils have Bt Horizons with hues of 2.5YR or 5YR. McNew and Nutt soils have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments in the control section. Dona Ana and Tres Hermanos soils are calcareous to the surface. Madurez soils lack a Btk horizon and have an argillic horizon thinner than 10 inches."
