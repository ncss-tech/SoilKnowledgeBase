Kalihi soils have 2.5YR or yellower hue, below the A horizon and their clay is dominantly kaolinite.  Kapuhikani soils are usually dry, lack mottles, and have bedrock at 24- and 35-inch depth.  Kokokahi soils have 2.5Y or yellower hue in the AC and C horizons.  Lualualei soils lack mottles and have cracks that remain open more than 90 days in most years, but not for the entire year.  Makalapa soils lack mottles, have chroma of 2 in the upper 12 inches and formed in volcanic tuff.  Nonopahu soils lack mottles and have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Papaa soils have moist chroma of 2 in the A horizon and lack mottles throughout."
