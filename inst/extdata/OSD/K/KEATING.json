  "OVERVIEW": "The Keating series consists of moderately deep, well drained\nsoils that formed in colluvium derived dominantly from\ngreenstone, with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in\nthe surface.  Keating soils are on hills and have slopes of\n2 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16\ninches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees\nF.",
