  "STATES": "HI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kahaluu series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in organic material overlying pahoehoe lava. Kahaluu soils are on high elevation windward northeasterly slopes of Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual rainfall is about 3048 millimeters (120 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C. (57 degrees F.).",
