  "OVERVIEW": "The Kagman series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability. They are on uplifted limestone plateaus and formed in sediments overlying coralline limestone. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F.",
