  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  Depth to weathered andesite is 20 to 40 inches.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  Thickness of the ashy material is 14 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 85 percent rock fragments and 10 to 15 percent clay in the upper part and 25 to 35 percent clay in the lower part.  It is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90g/cc.  Phosphate retention is 70 to 90 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron of 2 to 3 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  There is 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  The 15-bar water retention is 8 to 12 percent on air dry samples.  It has 5 to 10 percent gravel, 25 to 35 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon is similar to the A and has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent gravel, 25 to 35 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent stones.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and has 60 to 70 percent cobbles, 5 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 5 percent gravel..  Phosphate retention is 50 to  75 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron of 0.4 to 1 percent.  There is 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate.  The 15-bar water retention is 16 to 30 percent on air dried samples."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kutcher soils are on nearly level to moderately steep south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Elevation ranges from 3000 to 5600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from andesite with a mantle of volcanic ash in the surface. The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and warm and moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 90 inches, the mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 30 to 90 days."
