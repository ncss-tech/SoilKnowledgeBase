The underlying material contains up to 15 percent by volume coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Mottles range from few to many and faint to prominent. The E horizon extends into the Bt horizon in some pedons and bleached sand and silt coats the surfaces of peds in the Bt horizon.
