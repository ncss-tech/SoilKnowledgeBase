  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kernville series consists of shallow to a lithic contact, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  Kernville soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches (300 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F. (14 degrees C.)",
