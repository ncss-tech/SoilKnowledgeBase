    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Thickness of the loess over Pleistocene age terrace deposits (2Bt horizon) ranges from 4 to 10 feet. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the A horizon, and from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the E, Bt and Bt/E horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4; or value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 4; or value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe A/B horizon, where present has the same range in color in the A and B parts as the A horizon and the Bt horizon. Texture is silt loam.\nThe E or Bw horizon, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon, where present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Content of sand coarser than very fine sand is less than 5 percent to a depth of 48 inches or more. Iron-manganese accumulations on the faces of peds range from few to many. Skeletans range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Bt part of the Bt/E or 2Bt/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. The E parts are interfingerings of albic material between peds that range from 2 to 20 mm. wide. They make up more than 15 percent of the volume in one or more subhorizons within a depth of 80 inches. These interfingerings generally extend upward from the bottom of the solum due to the flushing action of a deep, intermittently fluctuating water table. The E material has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 2 or 3. Iron or clay depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown range from none to common. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the Bt parts, and silt loam or silt in the E parts.  Up to 5 percent calcium carbonate nodules are in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt or 2Bt/E horizon, where present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. Iron or clay depletions in shades of gray, and iron accumulations in shades of brown range from few to common. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam or clay loam."

Kleinpeter soils were formerly included in the Memphis and Loring series."
