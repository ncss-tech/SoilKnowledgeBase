  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Thickness of the loess over Pleistocene age terrace deposits (2Bt horizon) ranges from 4 to 10 feet. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the A horizon, and from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the E, Bt and Bt/E horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4; or value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 4; or value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe A/B horizon, where present has the same range in color in the A and B parts as the A horizon and the Bt horizon. Texture is silt loam.\nThe E or Bw horizon, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon, where present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Content of sand coarser than very fine sand is less than 5 percent to a depth of 48 inches or more. Iron-manganese accumulations on the faces of peds range from few to many. Skeletans range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Bt part of the Bt/E or 2Bt/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. The E parts are interfingerings of albic material between peds that range from 2 to 20 mm. wide. They make up more than 15 percent of the volume in one or more subhorizons within a depth of 80 inches. These interfingerings generally extend upward from the bottom of the solum due to the flushing action of a deep, intermittently fluctuating water table. The E material has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 2 or 3. Iron or clay depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown range from none to common. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the Bt parts, and silt loam or silt in the E parts.  Up to 5 percent calcium carbonate nodules are in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt or 2Bt/E horizon, where present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. Iron or clay depletions in shades of gray, and iron accumulations in shades of brown range from few to common. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam or clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kleinpeter soils are on salt domes. They formed in Peorian age loess deposits 4 to 10 feet thick over Pleistocene age terrace deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The climate is humid temperate. Average annual precipitation is 61 inches, and mean annual temperature is 68 degrees F. Elevation ranges from 7 to 50 feet above mean sea level. Frost free days range from 230 to 250."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Duson and Coteau soils. Duson and Coteau soils have aquic conditions in the upper 10 inches of the subsoil and do not have a glossic horizon. In addition, Duson soils have a loess cap that is 30 to 60 inches thick, and have a perched water table above the discontinuity."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

The lower part of the solum is saturated in the layers below 30 and 40 inches deep for 30 to 60 cumulative days during December through April in normal years. The soils are subject to rare flooding from tidal surges caused by hurricanes and tropical storms."

    "section": "SERIES ESTABLISHED",
    "content": "SERIES ESTABLISHED: The series was proposed in 1996, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. The series was retypified and established in St. Mary Parish by an Amendment to the Correlation in 2002 based on data from the hyperthermic study. It was reclassified from a Glossic Hapludalf to an Oxyaquic Glossudalf based on closer observations in a pit at the current type location. Kleinpeter soils were formerly included in the Memphis and Loring series."
