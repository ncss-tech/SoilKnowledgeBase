  "STATES": "KS,NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kipson series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from calcareous silty shales. Kipson soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters (33 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
