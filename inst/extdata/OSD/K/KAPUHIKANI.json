  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 51 to 91 centimeters (20 to 36 inches) deep over hard basalt.  Stoniness ranges from very stony to extremely stony.  Olivine crystals range from few to many throughout the profile.  Mean annual soil temperature is 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.)  The soil is dry more than 6 months in most years.  The A horizon is typically 10YR in hue but ranges to 7.5YR.   Value and chroma in the A horizon are 2 or 3.  Slickensides in the B horizon range from common to many and are weakly to strongly grooved. This soil can shrink when dry and can have wide cracks in the surface. The soil can also swell when wet."
