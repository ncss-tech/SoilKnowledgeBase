  "OVERVIEW": "The Kimtah series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Kimtah soils are found on slopes of 5 to 45 percent on valley bottoms, debris aprons and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 2,000 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
