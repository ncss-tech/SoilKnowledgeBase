    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kimtah soils are found on slopes of 5 to 45 percent on valley bottoms, debris aprons and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations 900 to 1,600 meters.  They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2,000 to 3,300 millimeters and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C.  Frost free season is 30 to 60 days."
