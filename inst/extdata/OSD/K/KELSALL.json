  "OVERVIEW": "The Kelsall series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from metamorphic rocks.  Kelsall soils occur on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

There is assumed more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 25 to 65 percent gravel and 5 to 40 percent cobble.  Tree throw and micro-wasting has resulted in mixing and churning of horizons in many profiles.  Clay content throughout the profile is less than 5 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value moist from 2 to 5, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 30 percent with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5 YR, or 10YR, value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist from 2 to 6.

Kupreanof soils are very deep.  Krubate (P) soils occur on outwash plains and have sand and gravel substratums.  Nataga (P) soils occur on alluvial fans, lack spodic horizons, and are very deep with sand and gravel substratums."
