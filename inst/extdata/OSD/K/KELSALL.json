    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches.   The solum ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  There is assumed more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 25 to 65 percent gravel and 5 to 40 percent cobble.  Tree throw and micro-wasting has resulted in mixing and churning of horizons in many profiles.  Clay content throughout the profile is less than 5 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value moist from 2 to 5, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 30 percent with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5 YR, or 10YR, value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist from 2 to 6.  Textures are silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nC horizons are present in some pedons."

The climate is humid maritime with the average annual precipitation ranging from 21 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F.  The slope gradient is commonly 40 to 70 percent, but the range is 10 to 70 percent.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 2,800 feet.  The frost free season is 90 to 150 days."

Ferebee (P) soils occur on mountain ridge crests and sideslopes, and lack spodic horizons.  Foad (P) soils occur on adjacent mountain sideslopes and are moderately deep over bedrock.  Kupreanof soils are very deep.  Krubate (P) soils occur on outwash plains and have sand and gravel substratums.  Nataga (P) soils occur on alluvial fans, lack spodic horizons, and are very deep with sand and gravel substratums."
