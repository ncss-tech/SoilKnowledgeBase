  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lenoir series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are Ackwater, Angie, Bethera, Chrysler, Coxville, Dunbar, Duplin, Grady, Lynchburg, Nahunta, Persanti, Shuster, Smithboro, Tiak, and Tomast.  Ackwater, Angie, Chrysler, Duplin, Persanti, Shuster, and Tiak soils have dominant moist chroma of 3 or more immediately below any Ap or A horizon and lack an aquic moisture regime.  In addition, Duplin and Persanti soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Bethera, Coxville, and Grady soils do not have a horizon with dominant chroma of 3 or more within 30 inches of the soils surface.  In addition, Coxville and Grady soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Dunbar and Smithboro soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Lenoir soils lack many prominent red mottles in the Bt horizon.  Lynchburg soils have fine-loamy control section.  Nahunta and Tomast soils have fine-silty control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kinta soils are on nearly level or very gently sloping ridge crests or flats in the Western Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in clayey sediments of Cretaceous age.  Climate is humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 72 to 80.  Kinta soils receive average precipitation of 10.2 inches during the months of July through September."

Felker soils occur on similar areas but have fine-silty control sections.  Kullit soils occur on similar areas but have fine-loamy control sections.  Tiak and Tomast soils occur on similar areas."
