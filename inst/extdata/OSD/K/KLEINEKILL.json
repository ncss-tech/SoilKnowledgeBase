  "OVERVIEW": "The Kleinekill series consists of very deep, well drained soils on anthropogenic landforms. These soils form in a thick mantle of human transported material that includes loamy soil material over a clay liner over household refuse. They occur in landfills in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or moderately high in the loamy material, and very low in the compacted clay layer. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1262 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Total thickness of the combined loamy mantle and clay liner over the refuse layer ranges from 90 to 120 cm; and the total thickness of the landfill materials are generally more than 1.5 meters thick. The human transported soil material that forms the loamy mantle may be any geologic deposit ranging from till, outwash, alluvium, coastal/marine sediments, or residuum. The clayey liner material, usually 30 cm thick, is often derived from Cretaceous age coastal plain deposits. Rock fragments range from 1 to 30 percent in the loamy material, and from 0 to 5 percent in the clay liner. Coarse fragments, both rocks and human artifacts combined, range from 35 to 75 percent in the refuse layer. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures include sandy loam, loam, silt loam. Structure is granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable to friable.\nThe ^Bw or ^Bwu horizons, if present, have hue of 2.5Y to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Textures include sandy loam, loam, silt loam; structure is commonly subangular blocky or fine platy, and consistence is very friable to friable.\nThe ^C or ^Cu horizons have hue of 2.5Y to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Textures include sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam; structure is massive, and consistence is firm.\nThe 2^C horizon, or clay liner, has hue 2.5Y to 10Y, including neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Textures include sandy clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, and clay; structure is massive, and consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe 3^C horizons below the clay liner contain layers of municipal refuse and human transported soil and rock material. Human artifacts in the refuse include paper, cardboard, carpet, cloth, plastic, glass, metal, organic waste, and rubber. There is a smaller component of construction materials such as asphalt, brick, concrete, treated and untreated lumber, metal, plasterboard, plus small amounts of coal ash. Household objects range from gravel to stone-sized, and construction materials range from gravel to boulder-size. There is a distinction between artifacts that will hold water, allow roots to penetrate and decompose versus those that are impenetrable, persistent and function similar to rock fragments. Examples of impenetrable persistent artifacts are glass, plastic, rubber, and treated lumber. Generally, the human transported soil material is similar to the soil mantle over the geomembrane. Texture of the human transported soil material ranges from loamy sand to silt loam. Consistence is loose to firm. Some intermittent layers or materials such as plastic act as a barrier to root and water movement."

These soils form in a cap of anthrotransported soil material over household garbage. The anthrotransported soil material is from somewhat locally excavated materials including alluvial deposits, glacial materials or coastal plains sediments. Dominant coarse fragments in the substratum are human manufactured items. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 mm. Mean annual\ntemperature ranges from 16 to 29 degrees C."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Kleinekill typical pedon has been drafted from a combination of field observations and soil property concepts based on landfill cover specifications established by New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY). These specifications are based on Type III Final Cover defined in DSNY's Final Cover Design Report for Sections 2/8 and 3/4.  Every effort has been made to create a representative pedon based on these specificiations, however public health concern has prevented field staff from gathering standard documentation and field verifying the cover specifications for Kleinekill soils.\nSome pedons develop anaerobic conditions in the subsoil due to methane gas emissions which may promote the formation of redoximorphic features without saturation by water.\nThe internal soil temperature has been modified by high levels of biological activity and garbage undergoing rapid decomposition. The classification as hyperthermic is debatable. The area would typically be classified as mesic.\nOne year soil temperature data is available for 10 cm and 50 cm depths. A poster describing temperature investigations is referenced below. The internal soil temperature has been modified by high levels of biological activity and garbage undergoing rapid decomposition. The classification as hyperthermic is the subject of some debate but the study and lab data support the hyperthermic soil temperature classification. The area would typically be mesic.\nReference: Mount, Henry and Luis Hernandez. Temperature Signatures for Urban Soils of New York City. Poster session presented at: First International Conference on Soils of Urban, Industrial, Traffic, and Mining Areas; 2000 Jul 12-18; Essen, Germany.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 28 cm (Bw horizon).\n3. Oxyaquic subgroup - saturation within 100 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.\n4. The classification of this series is provisional until new Taxonomic classifications are developed for anthropogenic soils."
