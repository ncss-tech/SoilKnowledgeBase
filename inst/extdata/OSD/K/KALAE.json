All horizons are very strongly acid or extremely acid. The umbric epipedon is 15 to 38 centimeters (6 to 15 inches) thick. Depth to bedrock is more than 183 centimeters (6 feet). The upper part of the B horizon is mixed with the A in most cultivated areas.\nRange of Individual Horizons:\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and 2 through 4 when dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist or dry and chroma of 3 to 6 when moist or dry.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist or dry and chroma of 3 to 6 when moist or dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 7.5 YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist or dry and chroma of 3 to 6 when moist or dry."
