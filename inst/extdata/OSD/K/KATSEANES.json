  "OVERVIEW": "The Katseanes series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced by valley side alluvium.  Katseanes soils are on basalt plains and hills.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
