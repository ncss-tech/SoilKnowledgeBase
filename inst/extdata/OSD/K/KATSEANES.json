Carbol soils are gravelly sandy clay loam with a large proportion of medium to very coarse, angular granitic sands with flat bearing surfaces.  Chittum soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Gilispie soils are gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam with 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments and have average annual soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F."

These soils have formed in loess influenced by valley side alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches.  Most of this precipitation comes in the winter and spring months.  Average annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."
