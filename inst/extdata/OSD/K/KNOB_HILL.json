  "OVERVIEW": "The Knob Hill series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The Knob Hill soils are on erosional fan remnants, inset fans, alluvial fans, and relict sand sheets. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
