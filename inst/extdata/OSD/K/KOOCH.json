    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to carbonates ranges from 18 to 38 inches. The series control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay. Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 1 to 8 percent by volume. Aquic conditions occur at a depth of 12 to 24 inches in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon 1 to 3 inches thick. The O horizon is partially to well decomposed organic matter from remains of trees, shrubs, sedges, and forest floor flora. It has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 1 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E/B horizon has characteristics similar to the E horizon and the Bt horizon\nSome pedons have a B/E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC or Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.
