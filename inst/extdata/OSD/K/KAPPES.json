  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Texture of the control section is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with 8 to 18 percent clay.  Content of rock fragments is less than 15 percent in most pedons but ranges from 0 to 35 percent gravel or channers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and a chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 10 to 40 percent.  Reaction is mildly through strongly alkaline.  EC is less than 8 mmhos.  A thin C horizon may occur above the bedrock in some pedons.\nThe Cr horizon has variable hardness but in all pedons is rippable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kappes soils are on nearly level to moderately steep upland plateaus and hillslopes.  Parent materials are commonly associated with the Bridger Formation. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 6,400 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, being fairly distributed throughout the year but somewhat higher from March through June.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated at 85 to 110 days."
