  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates range from 20 to 60 inches. Gravel of mixed lithology, but dominated by shale fragments, typically make up 2 to 8 percent of the volume of the series control section, but the upper part of the profile in some pedons contains less than 2 percent gravel. Rounded shale fragments dominate the coarse sand fraction. Soil saturation occurs above a depth of 40 inches in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam. The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5. Faint to prominent Fe concentrations and depletions commonly are above a depth of 40 inches. Redoximorphic depletions do not occur in the upper 10 inches of this horizon. The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon typically contains 35 to 45 percent clay. B/A clay ratios are 1.2 to 1.4. The Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay. The reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has properties similar to the 2C horizon. Some pedons have a 2BK horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 5. It is clay loam or loam. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kilkenny soils have plane and convex slopes on gently sloping to steep end moraines of the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Their slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. They formed in a mantle of clayey glacial till or flow till and underlying loamy glacial till on moraines. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 32 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 145 to 175 days. Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,500 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glencoe, Lerdal, Lester, Le Sueur, Lura, Mazaska, and Shields series. The very poorly drained Glencoe and Lura soils are in the lower lying drainageways and depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Lerdal soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep areas. Shields soils are poorly drained, and are on slightly elevated flats. Mazaska soils are poorly drained, and are on slightly elevated flats and swales above or within areas of Kilkenny soils. Also, the well drained Lester soils and the moderately well drained Le Sueur soils are associated in a few areas."

Water table studies and field observations have verified a perched condition in normal years, particularly in periods of extended rainfall.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record number MN0376.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
