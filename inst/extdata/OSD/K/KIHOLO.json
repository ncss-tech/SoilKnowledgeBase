These soils are in depressions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe lava flows that are greater than 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 180 to 510 millimeters (7 to 20 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from December through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2540 millimeters (80 to 100 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees C. (76 to 86 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
