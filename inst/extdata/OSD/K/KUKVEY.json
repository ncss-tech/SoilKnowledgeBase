  "OVERVIEW": "The Kukvey series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium that has been modified by wind.  Permeability is very rapid.  Kukvey soils are on stream and fan terraces with hummocky micro-relief and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Most areas of the Kukvey series were mapped as the Tindahay series in the Fort Hall Area Soil Survey, 1977.  The approximate site of the type location of the Tindahay series was excavated and redescribed in October, 1993.  This observation showed that the soil had a mollic epipedon, a weak calcic horizon, and the 6 to 13-inch layer was loamy sand instead of sandy loam.  As a result the Tindahay type location was mapped as the Kukvey series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 17 inches (Ap and A horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 45 to 60 inches (Bk horizon)\nAridic subgroup - Kukvey soils occur within an area with an aridic soils moisture regime that is bordering on xeric.\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A horizon, the Bw1 horizon and part of the Bw2 horizon)"
