The soil formed in mixed sandy alluvium that has been modified by wind to give it a hummocky micro-relief.  The climate is semi-arid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 120 days."

Quincy soils are on dunes and terraces, have an ochric epipedon and do not have a calcic horizon.  Shoban soils are on stream terraces and have a water table at a depth of 24 to 40 inches during May through November.  Tickason soils are on stream terraces and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Most areas of the Kukvey series were mapped as the Tindahay series in the Fort Hall Area Soil Survey, 1977.  The approximate site of the type location of the Tindahay series was excavated and redescribed in October, 1993.  This observation showed that the soil had a mollic epipedon, a weak calcic horizon, and the 6 to 13-inch layer was loamy sand instead of sandy loam.  As a result the Tindahay type location was mapped as the Kukvey series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 17 inches (Ap and A horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 45 to 60 inches (Bk horizon)\nAridic subgroup - Kukvey soils occur within an area with an aridic soils moisture regime that is bordering on xeric.\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A horizon, the Bw1 horizon and part of the Bw2 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
