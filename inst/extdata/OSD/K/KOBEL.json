  "STATES": "AR,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kobel series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These level to nearly level soils are on floodplains in the Western Lowlands of the lower Mississippi valley; MLRA 131.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature near the type location is about 62 degrees and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Cracks 1 to 3 cm wide develop to a depth of 20 inches or deeper in most years.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon; slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the B horizon and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or with value of 5, and chroma of 1.  Iron accumulations are in shades of gray, yellow or brown.  A horizons with value of 3 are less than 10 inches thick.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Thin silt loam overwash phases are also recognized.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  The average clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 35 to 55 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red.  Texture commonly is silty clay or sandy clay but it ranges from fine sandy loam through clay."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kobel soils are on depressional to nearly level floodplains, abandoned channels and oxbows of the White, Black, Cache and St. Francis Rivers and other larger streams in the Western Lowlands and St. Francis Basin of the Southern Mississippi Valley.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in clayey alluvium with montmorillonitic mineralogy. They are flooded for brief to very long periods nearly every year unless protected by levees.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 58 to 64 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 46 to 52 inches."

Amagon  soils are on adjacent terraces and in a fine-silty particle size class.  Askew soils are on adjacent terraces; are in a fine-silty particle size class and are moderately well drained.  Commerce and Yancopin soils are on similar landscape positions; are in a fine-silty particle size class, do not have cambic horizons and are somewhat poorly drained.  Dubbs soils are on adjacent higher terraces; are in a fine-silty particle size class and are well drained.  Foley soils are on adjacent terraces; are in a fine-silty particle size class and have a natric horizon.  Taylorbay soils are on similar landscapes; have a mollic epipedon; are in a fine-silty particle size class and are well drained.  Tipp soils are on similar landscape positions; have a mollic epipedon and are moderately well drained.  Tuckerman and Wardell soils are on similar positions and in a fine-loamy particle size class."
