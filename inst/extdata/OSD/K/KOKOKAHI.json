Kaena soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the C horizon and they are mottled throughout.  Kapuhikani soils are calcareous in the lower part of the C horizon, and are dry for more than 6 months in most years.  Lualualei soils are well drained and have 10YR or 7.5YR hue below the A horizon.  Makalapa soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR below the A horizon and are strongly calcareous in the C horizon.  Nonopahu soils have moist chroma of 2 or more in the upper 12 inches.  Papaa soils have moist chroma of 2 in the upper 12 inches and hue of 10YR or redder below the A horizon."
