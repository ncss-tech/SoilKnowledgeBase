Halii soils have mean annual soil temperature of about 71 degrees F., lack plinthite, and have lenses or nodules that contain more than 30 percent gibbsite within depths of 40 inches.  Kahanui soils have a petroferric contact within about 20 inches of the surface.  Pooku soils lack plinthite within depth of 40 inches, have a fine-textured control section and mean annual soil temperature of about 71 degrees F."

The soils formed in residuum from basic igneous rocks.  Average annual rainfall is 70 to 150 inches and nearly all days have cloud cover.
