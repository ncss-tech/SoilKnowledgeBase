  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kamrar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on convex knobs and linear side slopes. These soils formed in moderately fine or fine textured glacio-fluvial or lacustrine sediments and the underlying loamy glacial till. Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches).",

The Guckeen series was changed to being only somewhat poorly drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nParticle-size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches);\nSeries control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (59 inches).\nMollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 38 centimeters (15 inches) (Ap and A horizons);\nCambic horizon--the zone from 38 to 137 centimeters (15 to 54 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, 2Bk1, and 2Bk2 horizons);\nUdic moisture regime.\nOxyaquic subgroup based on redox features and iron and manganese concretions above a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches).\nSome pedons may have clay films or pressure faces in the B horizon but do not meet the requirements of an argillic horizon."
