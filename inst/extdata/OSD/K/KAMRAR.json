    "content": "REMARKS: The drainage class was changed to moderately well due to the presence of redoximorphic features above a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches). The Guckeen series was changed to being only somewhat poorly drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nParticle-size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches);\nSeries control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (59 inches).\nMollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 38 centimeters (15 inches) (Ap and A horizons);\nCambic horizon--the zone from 38 to 137 centimeters (15 to 54 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, 2Bk1, and 2Bk2 horizons);\nUdic moisture regime.\nOxyaquic subgroup based on redox features and iron and manganese concretions above a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches).\nSome pedons may have clay films or pressure faces in the B horizon but do not meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to NSSL pedon numbers 64IA079001 and 64IA079002 for lab results of representative pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
