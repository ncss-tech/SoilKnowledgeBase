  "OVERVIEW": "The Kyler series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Kyler soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
