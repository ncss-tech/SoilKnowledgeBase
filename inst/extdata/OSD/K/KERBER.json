  "OVERVIEW": "The Kerber series consists of very deep, poorly drained or somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from igneous rocks.  Kerber soils are on low terraces and depressions on nearly level valley floors and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 50 percent in the Bt horizon and a majority of subhorizons, but is less than 15 percent in the A and E horizons in some pedons.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 12 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and other soluble salt accumulation ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the lower part of the C horizon and are dominantly 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma 2 through 6.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 8, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through4.  Redox features are common in the lower part of the solum and C horizon, and ranges from faint to distinct, with both dull and bright chroma usually present.  This soil is saturated with water in some horizons above one meter for significant periods when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is sand or gravelly sand and has 0 to 35 percent pebbles."
