  "OVERVIEW": "The Kohatk series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in calcareous mixed slope alluvium, residuum and colluvium from limestone.  Kohatk soils are on hills with slopes of 10 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",
