These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days."
