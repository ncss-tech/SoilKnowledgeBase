  "OVERVIEW": "The Kearns series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary rocks.  Kearns soils are on alluvial fans and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
