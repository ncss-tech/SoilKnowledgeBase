The average annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 40 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and is 60 to 75 percent coarse fragments.  Soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe E2 horizon has value of 5, 6, or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Texture is extremely gravelly loam, or very gravelly loam.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5, 6, or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 3 to 6 moist.  It is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kingmont soils are on mountainsides that generally have a northerly aspect.  Slopes range from 30 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from serpentine with some slate, phyllite, and gabbro pebbles and minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash. Elevation is 2,200 feet to 4,800 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with a snowpack from December through March.  The average annual precipitation is 27 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature is about 23 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 66 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 4l to 43 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is l40 to l65 days."
