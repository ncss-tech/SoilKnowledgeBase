Soil color does not meet the darkness requirements of an umbric epipedon.\nB. Argillic horizon - 10 to 101 inches (Bt) ranges from 60 to 105 inches thick.\nWeighted average is .20 but it is assumed there is some gibbsite.\nAssume that there are greater than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the upper 50 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled by University of California, Davis.
