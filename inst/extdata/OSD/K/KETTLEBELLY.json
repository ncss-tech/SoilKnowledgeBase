    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nA. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 10 inches thick (A) ranges from 7 to 12 inches thick.\n1. Organic carbon by U.C. Davis is 2.5 to 1.5 percent to a depth of 10 inches and decreases regularly with depth. 2. Base saturation by U.C. Davis is 15 to 25 percent to a depth of 10 inches. 3. Soil color does not meet the darkness requirements of an umbric epipedon.\nB. Argillic horizon - 10 to 101 inches (Bt) ranges from 60 to 105 inches thick.\nWeighted average is .20 but it is assumed there is some gibbsite.\nAssume that there are greater than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the upper 50 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled by University of California, Davis.  Pedon number 82-45-204X.  x-ray diffraction indicates mineralogy is mixed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
