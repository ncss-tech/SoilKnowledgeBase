  "OVERVIEW": "The Klasi series consists of poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in a thick organic mat overlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Permafrost occurs at a depth of 4 to 38\ninches.  Klasi soils are on broad lacustrine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material ranges from 8 to 16 inches thick. Depth to permafrost ranges from 4 to 38 inches below the surface of the mineral soil two months after the summer solstice.  There is more than 35 percent clay by weighted average in the particle size control section.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A or AC horizon has moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizons have moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures include silty clay and clay. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent with 0 to 10 percent cobble and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  A lag concentration of coarse fragments is\ncommon along the upper boundary of the horizon.\nIce content in the Cf horizon is variable and includes disseminated or segregated ice crystals or thin seams."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Klasi soils are poorly or very poorly drained; runoff is very slow; permeability is moderate above the impermeable permafrost.  The profile typically is saturated with water in the A horizon, but free water often occurs within the organic surface\nhorizon in depressional areas.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is destroyed by fire or clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level with subsequent lowering of the water table."
