  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. Solum thickness and depth to weathered bedrock is typically 20 to 30 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay with 0 to 10 percent rock fragments and 0 to 35 percent pararock fragments. The solum is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam or silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 0 to 20 percent paragravel, and 0 to 15 percent paracobbles.\nThe AB or BA horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist or dry.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent paragravel, and 0 to 10 percent paracobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam or silty clay in the upper part, ranging to silty clay loam, silty clay or clay in the lower part with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent paragravel, and 0 to 10 percent paracobbles.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 10 to 35 percent pararock fragments.\nThe underlying bedrock dominantly is siltstone that is partially weathered, has a paralithic contact, and is commonly fractured with spacing of fractures greater than 4 inches. The volume of interstitial material ranges from near 0 to 15 percent in the upper few inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blachly, Dement, Desolation, and Melby series. Blachly, Dement, Desolation, and Melby soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Desolation and Melby soils lack hue as red as 5YR in the solum. Further investigation is needed to determine if the Desolation series actually occurs in the isomesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kilowan soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes, and back slopes of mountains. Slopes are 3 to 75 percent. The soils formed in clayey colluvium and  residuum derived from siltstone and sandstone. Elevations are 250 to 1,800 feet. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 63 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 120 inches. The frost free period is 110 to 210 days."

All of these soils occur on mountains. Bohannon soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, are fine-loamy, and are 20 to 40 inches deep to arkosic sandstone. Honeygrove, Preacher and Slickrock soils are deeper than 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Kilchis soils are loamy-skeletal and less than 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Klickitat soils have an umbric epipedon 10 inches or more thick and are loamy-skeletal. Honeygrove and Peavine soils have an argillic horizon. Trask soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and are loamy-skeletal."
