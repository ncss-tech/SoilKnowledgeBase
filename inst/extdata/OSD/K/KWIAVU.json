  "OVERVIEW": "The Kwiavu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from diorite.  Kwiavu soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 6 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
