    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The combined thickness of the organic horizons ranges from 8 to 18 inches and is at least twice as thick as the mineral horizons.  Mineral horizon thickness ranges from 1 to 4 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout the profile.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Oe horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma 1 or 2.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma from 1 to 3.\nA thin A horizon is present in some pedons above the C horizon, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma from 0 to 3.\nThe C horizon has value from 4 to 6, and chroma from 0 to 2.  Mottles, if present, have hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma from 1 to 4.  The texture typically is sandy loam, but ranges from very fine sandy loam to loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent with 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent gravel."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kitkun soils range in distribution from coastal zones to inland uplands.  In inland areas, the soils are on mountain crests and hillslopes.  In coastal zones, the soils are on backslopes and footslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The climate is humid maritime with an average annual precipitation of 120 inches.  Snow remains on the ground from 6 to 9 months of the year.  The mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is about 39 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 1000 feet."

Grindall soils are moderately deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that overlie bedrock on toeslopes and footslopes of hills.  Helm soils are shallow, mineral soils on backslopes.  Hofstad soils are moderately deep, poorly drained, mineral soils on footslopes and backslopes of mountains and hills.  Kaikli soils are deep, very poorly drained, organic soils on backslopes and footslopes of hills and mountains.  Karheen soils are deep, very poorly drained organic soils on uplifted beaches adjacent to tidal waters.  McGilvery soils are shallow, well drained soils derived from decomposing litter overlying bedrock on convex hillslopes and backslopes.  St. Nicholas soils are shallow, poorly drained mineral soils on backslopes of hills and mountains."
