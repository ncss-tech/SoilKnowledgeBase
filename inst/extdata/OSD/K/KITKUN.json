  "OVERVIEW": "The Kitkun series consists of shallow to bedrock, very poorly drained organic soils underlain by mineral horizons.  Kitkun soils are on backslopes, footslopes and toeslopes of mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches.",

The combined thickness of the organic horizons ranges from 8 to 18 inches and is at least twice as thick as the mineral horizons.  Mineral horizon thickness ranges from 1 to 4 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout the profile.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Oe horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma 1 or 2.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma from 1 to 3.\nA thin A horizon is present in some pedons above the C horizon, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma from 0 to 3.\nThe C horizon has value from 4 to 6, and chroma from 0 to 2.  Mottles, if present, have hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma from 1 to 4.  The texture typically is sandy loam, but ranges from very fine sandy loam to loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent with 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent gravel."

Snow remains on the ground from 6 to 9 months of the year.  The mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is about 39 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 1000 feet."

Grindall soils are moderately deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that overlie bedrock on toeslopes and footslopes of hills.  Helm soils are shallow, mineral soils on backslopes.  Hofstad soils are moderately deep, poorly drained, mineral soils on footslopes and backslopes of mountains and hills.  Kaikli soils are deep, very poorly drained, organic soils on backslopes and footslopes of hills and mountains.  Karheen soils are deep, very poorly drained organic soils on uplifted beaches adjacent to tidal waters.  McGilvery soils are shallow, well drained soils derived from decomposing litter overlying bedrock on convex hillslopes and backslopes.  St. Nicholas soils are shallow, poorly drained mineral soils on backslopes of hills and mountains."
