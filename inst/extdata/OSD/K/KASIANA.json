The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 60 percent gravel.  Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nAn Oi horizon is present in some pedons.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.  The A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 2 or 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 50 percent gravel. The Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value from 3 to 5 and chroma from 2 to 3.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or silt loam. Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent gravel.  Mottles are commonly present.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or silt loam.
