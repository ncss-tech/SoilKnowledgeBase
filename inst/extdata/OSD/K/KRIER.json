  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 2 to 6 inches and corresponds with the thickness of the A horizon.  Free carbonates are at depths of 0 to 6 inches.  Fine sand, sand, or coarse sand is at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Sodium adsorption ratio is greater than 13 above depths of 20 inches and decreases with depth below 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is commonly loam but range includes sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and clay loam.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.  A few pedons have strata of loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It has high or low chroma mottles.  Pedons with moist value of 3 have thin strata of lighter colored material.  Conductivity of the saturated extract ranges between 4 and 16 millimhos per centimeter.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

All these soils lack an SAR that is greater than 13 percent in half or more in the upper 20 inches.  In addition, Dillwyn, Gracemore, and Kanza soils lack free carbonates in the upper 15 inches and Platte soils are mesic."
