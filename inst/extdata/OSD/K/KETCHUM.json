  "OVERVIEW": "The Ketchum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from limestone, quartzitic sandstone and related rock. Ketchum soils are on mountains and have slopes of 20 to 75 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nConverted to metric, updated formatting, and O horizons were updated to start at zero. 8/2022"
