  "OVERVIEW": "The Ketchum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from limestone, quartzitic sandstone and related rock. Ketchum soils are on mountains and have slopes of 20 to 75 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
