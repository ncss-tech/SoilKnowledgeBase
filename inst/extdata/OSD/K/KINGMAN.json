  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingman series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These nearly level soils are on flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A) and the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79).  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 28 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 58 degrees F.",

The soils are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is silty clay loam and less commonly loam or clay loam.  The lower part of this horizon has faint or distinct redoximorphic features in some pedons.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic accumulations range from faint to distinct and have a value of 5 to 7 and a chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe 2C or C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.
