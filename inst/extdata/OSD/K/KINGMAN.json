The soils are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is silty clay loam and less commonly loam or clay loam.  The lower part of this horizon has faint or distinct redoximorphic features in some pedons.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic accumulations range from faint to distinct and have a value of 5 to 7 and a chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe 2C or C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or sandy loam."
