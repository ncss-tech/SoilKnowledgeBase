  "OVERVIEW": "The Kalapa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum  and/or colluvium weathered from basic igneous rock.  Kalapa soils are on low mountain hillslopes and have slopes of 8 to 70 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 2,032 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C. (72 degrees F.)",
