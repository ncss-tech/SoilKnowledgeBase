  "REVDATE": "01/2009",
  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaski series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 66 centimeters (26 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).",
