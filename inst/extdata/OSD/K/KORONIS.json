    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 16 to 36 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise 2 to 15 percent by volume of the control section and typically range from 3 to 15 mm. in size.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The dry color has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nAn E horizon is present in most uncultivated pedons.  It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with a high sand content.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The dry color has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic features are present in the lower subhorizon in some pedons.  It typically is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  The argillic horizon has 18 to 24 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent sand.  The B/A clay ratio ranges from 1.2 to 1.4.  This horizon has thin through moderately thick and few through many clay films on faces of peds and in pores.  Coatings of clean sand and silt particles are in the upper part of some pedons. The Bt horizon ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  The BC horizon, when present, is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with less than 20 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent sand.  It lacks redox features in some pedons."

Angus and Sebbo soils have saturation in the lower third of the series control section.  Argyle, Baltimore and Oneco soils have B horizons with 7.5YR or redder hue.  Bassett soils are very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Blooming and Racine soils have 15 to 35 percent sand in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Caleb soils have some subhorizons that have more than 45 percent sand in the lower part of the control section.  Dowagiac soils have less than 24 percent clay in the lower one third of the particle-size control section.  Dunbridge, Waucoma, Newcomer and Winneshiek soils have bedrock at depths above 60 inches.  Gara soils average less than 2 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Longlois, Lydic and Neda soils have more than 45 percent sand in some subhorizon in the middle part of the control section.  Mohawk soils have a higher content of silt and have dark colors in the B horizon which apparently are inherited from dark shale.  Orwood soils have no rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Razort soils have less than 30 percent sand in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils generally are on convex slopes of moraines.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The Koronis soils formed in calcareous high sand, low clay glacial till of the Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F.   Mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 125 to 165.  Elevations above sea level range from 900 to 1600 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Cordova, Glencoe, Marcellon, and Sunburg soils which formed in similar parent materials and Terril soils formed in loamy colluvium derived from glacial till of mixed mineralogy.  The poorly drained Cordova soils are on flats and upper drainageways with a seasonal high water table.  The very poorly drained Glencoe soils are mostly in depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Marcellon soils are on slightly depressed elevated flats and gentle slopes.  The well drained Sunburg soils are on the most convex peaks and knolls.  The moderately well drained Terril soils are on concave toe slopes."
