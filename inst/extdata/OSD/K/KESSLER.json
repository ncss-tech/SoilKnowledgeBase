    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 65 to 73 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry but are continually moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nDepth to the calcic horizon is 6 to 15 inches.  Rock fragments are concentrated in the upper part of the A horizon in some pedons. These soils average more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has  hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is 6 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is a loam, silt loam or silty clay loam containing 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  It is moderately to very strongly alkaline."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous silty lacustrine and alluvial sediments derived from sedimentary rocks.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 66 to 73 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  March through May are the wettest months and June is the driest.  Frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

Freedom soils have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Pomat soils lack a calcic horizon.  Taylorsflat soils have more than 15 percent fine sand particles and less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
