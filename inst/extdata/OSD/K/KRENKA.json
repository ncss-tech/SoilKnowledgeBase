Bullvaro, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Camelback soils have lithic contacts between 100 and 200 cm from the soil surface and have fine-earth texture of silt loam throughout.  Chrisflat soils do not have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Dogbed soils do not have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon and have paralithic contacts between 150 and 200 cm from the soil surface.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Murain soils are dominated by stones and cobbles and average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Snyderville soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of less than 36 cm.  Softback soils average 25 to 32 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mollic epipedons that do not include the upper Bt horizons.  Softscrabble soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and typically have paralithic contacts between 150 and 200 cm from the soil surface."
