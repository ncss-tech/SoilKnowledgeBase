  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly red shale and range from 15 to 75 percent in the solum, and from 40 to 90 percent in the C horizon with an average of more than 50 percent in the textural control section. Where unlimed, soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout. Illite and vermiculite are dominant clay minerals and the soil contains detectable amounts of chlorite, kaolinite and interstratified clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nA thin grayish E horizon is in some pedons.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky. Consistence ranges from friable to firm, from nonsticky to slightly sticky, and from nonplastic to slightly plastic.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Arnot, Nassau, Sylvatus and Weikert soils are in the same family. Arnot soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments, dominantly sandstone, in the textural control section.  Nassau and Weikert soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout. Sylvatus soils formed in materials weathered primarily from metasediments of phyllite and slate with some shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.\nThe Benson, Bugley (T), Calvin, Catlett, Colyer, Dimal, Holyoke, Lehew, Manteo, Oquaga, Rohan, Unicoi and Zango series are similar soils in other families. Benson soils have base saturation of more than 60 percent. Bugley soil have common to many mica flakes and fragments of schist.  Calvin, Lehew, and Oquaga soils are deeper than 20 inches to bedrock. Catlett soils have chroma of 2 or less throughout. Colyer soils contain more than 35 percent clay. Dimal soils have rock fragments dominated by sandstones. Holyoke soils have less that 35 percent rock fragments. Rohan, Unicoi and Zango soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout. Manteo soils have soil temperatures of more than 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Klinesville soils are gently sloping to very steep upland soils on convex positions. Slopes range from 3 to 80 percent. Klinesville soils formed in weathered reddish shale with some slate, siltstone or fine-grained sandstone. The climate is humid temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 50 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 59 degrees F, and the growing season ranges from 130 to 200 days."
