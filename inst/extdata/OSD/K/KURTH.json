  "OVERVIEW": "The Kurth series consists of soils that are very deep to geologic materials of sandstone and/or mudstone. They are moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy coastal plain sediments. These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.",

Intrusions of albic material (E) make up 10 to 40 percent of the horizon, but are more than 15 percent in some subhorizon that is more than 2 inches thick. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\n2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma 1 or 2. Redox concentrations in masses range from few to many in shades of red or brown. Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has matrix colors mainly in shades of brown or gray, with strata, streaks, or masses with these colors or shades of yellow or red. It is weakly consolidated sandstone or mudstone or is stratified with these materials. In some pedons, it is also stratified with shale and/or siltstone.

Batson soils formed in Pleistocene age alluvium on the flatwoods or coast prairie, and do not have a discontinuity to geologic materials within a dpeth of 80 inches.  Alazan, Freestone, Metcalf, Sawlit and Sawtown soils have a solum thicker than 80 inches. In addition, Alazan, Freestone, Metcalf, Penning, and Sawlit soils have aquic conditions within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon, and Sawtown soils do not have a water table within 40 inches of the soil surface.

A prior revision (1993) changed the subgroup classification from Aquic to Typic, then it was changed back to Oxyaquic (1/1999). Aquic conditions are below a depth of 40 inches when present. Redox depletions and concentrations in the upper part of the glossic horizon are relic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon -- 0 to 18 inches (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon -- 6 to 18 inches (E horizon).\nArgillic horizon -- 18 to 69 inches (Bt/E and 2Btg horizons).\nGlossic horizon - 18 to 49 inches (Bt/E horizons).\nLithologic discontinuity -- 49 inches (top of the 2Btg horizon)."
