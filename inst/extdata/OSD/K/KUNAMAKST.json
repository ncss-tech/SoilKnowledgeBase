The particle-size control section has 15 to 27 percent field estimated clay and 30 to 50 percent sand and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments. Base saturation is less than 10 percent by ammonium acetate throughout the profile.\nThe E horizon has value of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 6 or 8 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.

The soils are formed in alpine glacial till derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. Elevations are 500 to 2500 feet. Average annual precipitation is 110 to 170 inches. Fog drip contributes to the effective precipitation totals. Average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
