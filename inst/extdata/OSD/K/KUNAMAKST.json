  "OVERVIEW": "The Kunamakst series consists of shallow to dense till, poorly drained soils that formed in alpine glacial till derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on ground moraines on till plains and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 140 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
