  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kermit soils are on nearly level to undulating and hummocky upland plains, alluvial fans, and valley side slopes. The soils formed in noncalcareous, deep, sandy material that has often been reworked by wind. Sand dunes, coppice mounds, and blowout areas are common surface features. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2450 to 3900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, most of the precipitation is received during the summer. The Thornthwaite P-E Index is generally less than 20. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 57 degrees to 70 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from about 190 to 230 days."

Cacique soils have argillic horizons and petrocalcic horizons. Largo soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control sections. Wink soils have calcic horizons.  Penwell soils are intergrading to an ustic moisture regime."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Type Location was changed from Ward County, Texas to Eddy County, New Mexico in an area more suitable for its classification. The Kermit soils were formerly included with the Tivoli series but are now separated on soil moisture and mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 12 inches. (A horizon)\nSilicious mineralogy - based on a reported weatherable mineral content of less than 3 percent.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  681100-681103, Riverside Lab., 1968.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
