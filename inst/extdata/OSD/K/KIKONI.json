    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kamakoa, Kamaoa, Kapapala, Kula, Kiolakaa, and Waimea series.  Kamakoa soils are alluvial soils. Kamaoa soils lack a buried B horizon with strong structure.  Kapapala are on Mauna Loa Volcano. Kula soils have weak structure in the A horizon and moderate structure in the upper part of the B horizon.  Kiolakaa soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Waimea soils have weak structure in the A horizon and lack a buried B horizon."

Elevation ranges from 792 to 1,097 meters (2,600 to 3,600 feet).  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash.  Annual rainfall is 635 to 1,270 millimeters (25 to 50 inches).
