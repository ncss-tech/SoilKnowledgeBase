  "OVERVIEW": "The Kikoni series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash overlying `a`a lava.  Kikoni soils are on ash fields and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1020 millimeters (40 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C. (65 degrees F.)",
