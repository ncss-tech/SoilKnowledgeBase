  "OVERVIEW": "The Kahola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium.  Kahola soils are on flood plains on river valleys in the Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters (33 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

To superactive.\n09/2015 DJK Updated intro to current standards. Added in metric units. Added clay content, sand content, fragments, and CCE to RIC. Updated competing series. Changed geographic setting to tabular and added in elevation, precipitation pattern, and FFD. Updated geographically associated soils by adding Reading and Ivan and deleting Eudora and Florence. Changed permeability to Ksat. Added crops to use and vegetation. Added LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent. Added lab data to additional data.\nAdditional data: Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory data is available for Pedon IDs 91KS061001ksu, 97KS161003, and 97KS061034.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
