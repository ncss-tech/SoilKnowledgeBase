    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kodra soils are on slightly dissected fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,555 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
