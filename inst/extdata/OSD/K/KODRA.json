  "OVERVIEW": "The Kodra series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Kodra soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
