  "OVERVIEW": "The Kech series consists of shallow, well drained, soils that developed in material weathered from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Kech soils are on plateaus, mesas, and buttes and have slopes ranging from 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
