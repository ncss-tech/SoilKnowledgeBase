Existing laboratory data for this series and other geographically associated soils does not reflect the presence of adequate quantities of volcanic glass to support the Aquandic subgroup. The series concept was changed to somewhat poorly drained, with endosaturation based on a review of existing pedons and current regional standards. The official series description was edited according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data--pedon numbers S2009WA067060\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
