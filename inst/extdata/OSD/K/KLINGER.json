  "REVDATE": "09/2016",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Klinger series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 102 centimeters of loess and the underlying glacial till. These soils are on interfluves and long side slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 895 millimeters.",
