Added ashy modifier to textures.\nSoil reclassified by CJ to correct dual particle size class and address the assignment of mineralogy correctly.  Previous classification:  Pumiceous or ashy-pumiceous over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic, isothermic Lithic Udivitrands\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nPenetrometer measurement: 3Bw horizon = 0.5 to 1 tons/square foot. Measurement was made by inserting penetrometer horizontally into (in situ) soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
