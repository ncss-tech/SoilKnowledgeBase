  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Krasna series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on coastal prairies. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1145 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",

The series was separated based on its location on the Beaumont Formation of Fort Bend and Austin Counties.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 54 to 104 cm (21 to 41 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 54 cm (0 to 21in) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 54 to 203 cm (21 to 80in) (Bt and 2Bt horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: 106 to 203 cm (42 to 80 in) (2Bt horizons)\nAdditional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity was determined by the ratio of very fine sand to fine sand which is markedly different than the overlying horizons and coincides where the horizon color is 5YR or redder and the presence of mica flakes. The reddish subsoil and mica flakes are considered to be a marker of Colorado and Brazos River sediments.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil survey office lab data available on the typical pedon (NASIS user site id of S2019TX1573074)\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
