Total thickness of the A, E, and Bh horizons is less than 6 inches and individual Bh horizons are less than 2 inches thick.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 4 to 14 inches (A, Bh and E horizons)\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD (Original Maryland Type Location Site): MD0053, MD0104 (SANDY SUBSTRATUM).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
