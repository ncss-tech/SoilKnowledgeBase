  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to metasedimentary bedrock is 60 to 80 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 57 degrees F., and the soil temperature is less than 41 degrees F. from December 15 to April 1.  The soil between depths of 10 and 25 inches is usually dry in all parts from July 15 until October 15 and is moist in some parts all the rest of the year.  It is moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1.  Rock fragments make up 15 to 60 percent in the A horizon and 30 to 60 percent in the B2t horizon.  Most rock fragments consist of quartz and quartzite pebbles and a few cobbles and stones.  Base saturation ranges from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon ranges from light gray, light yellowish brown and brown to dark grayish brown (10YR 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 6/1, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 5/1, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 5/4).  Moist colors range from dark yellowish brown to very dark brown (10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2, 2/2; 7.5YR 4/4, 3/2).  It is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 15 percent clay and is gravelly or very gravelly.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have an A3 horizon and others do not have a B1t horizon.\nThe Bt horizon ranges from yellow and very pale brown to pink and reddish brown (7/6, 7/4, 6/6, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4 in 10YR, 7.5YR and 5YR hues).  Moist colors range from yellowish brown to dark reddish brown (10YR and 5YR 6/6, 5/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3; 7.5YR 6/6, 5/6, 4/4, 3/4).  Chroma of 6 is in at least some part of the Bt horizon within a depth of 60 inches.  Soil colors are mainly lithochromic in the Bt horizon.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam, with 13 to 20 percent clay.  The amount of clay increase from the A horizon to the Bt horizon ranges from 3 to 7 percent.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has more than 35 percent rock fragments and less than 18 percent clay.  The clay content gradually increases with increasing depth.  It is moderately or strongly acid and commonly decreases in acidity with increasing depth.  The Bt horizon has weak fine and medium subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe B horizon commonly is over fractured bedrock but some pedons have a C horizon that consists of weathered rock and soil material.  It ranges from 1 to 6 inches thick and is similar to the B horizon in other characteristics."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abegg (T), Behemotosh (T), Marpa and Skalan series in other families.  Abegg soils are underlain by a lithologic discontinuity of very gravelly and very cobbly sandy loam and are dry 60 to 80 consecutive days.  Behemotosh, Marpa and Skalan soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kinkel soils are on mountains with long slopes and are on all aspects.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from metasedimentary and metavolcanic bedrock.  Commonly the land forms are steep narrow ridged interfluves between deeply incised drainageways.  Elevations are 2,500 to 5,800 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 20 to 30 inches.  Mean January temperature is 34 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 70 to 140 days."

Bonnet soils have a mollic epipedon, and ca horizon.  Boomer soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments and 25 to 35 percent clay in the B2t horizon.  Dubakella, Ipish and Weitchpec soils have serpentinitic mineralogy.  Duzel soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments and more than 75 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon.  Facey soils have a mollic epipedon, fine-loamy argillic horizon, and more than 75 percent base saturation.  Hilt soils have a fine-loamy control section with less than 35 percent fragments, and base saturation is more than 75 percent throughout the argillic horizon.  Kindig soils lack an argillic horizon and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Stoner soils lack an argillic horizon."
