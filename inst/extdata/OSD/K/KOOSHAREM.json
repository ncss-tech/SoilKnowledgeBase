The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and has 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser.  They are continually moist in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days out of the 120 days following the winter solstice and are dry 60 to 80 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years in all parts of the moisture control section within the 3 month period following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are a silt loam or loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline and is 10 to 50 inches thick. It is noncalcareous to slightly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically loam or silt loam with the range including stratified lenses of loamy sand or gravelly sand below depth of 40 inches.  It is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous and is neutral to moderately alkaline."
