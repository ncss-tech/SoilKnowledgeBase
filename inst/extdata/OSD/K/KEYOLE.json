    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,860 to 3,350 m. The climate is humid with cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, the mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."

Osditch soils have cambic horizons, do not have fragmental material in the lower horizons, have subhorizons with some lamellae, and have frigid soil temperature regime. Snacreek soils have mollic epipedons and do not have fragmental material in the lower horizons."

The potential native vegetation is a forest canopy of Engelmann's spruce and limber pine with a sparse understory of sedge, snowberry, and common juniper. This site is correlated to Ecological Site F28AY083NV Engelmann's spruce-mountain gooseberry-mountain brome and needlegrass."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOrganic soil material - The zone from the soil surface to 3 cm (Oi horizon).\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Oi, A and part of the Bw horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 13 to 46 cm (Bw horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (parts of the Bw and 2C horizons).\nThe revision of September 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal over fragmental, mixed, active, nonacid Typic Cryorthents. The strongly contrasting particle-size class was not appropriate based on current criteria for the Loamy-skeletal over fragmental class and a cambic horizon is now recognized in the series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
