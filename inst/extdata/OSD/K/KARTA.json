  "OVERVIEW": "The Karta series consists of moderately deep soils over paralithic compact till.  These moderately well and well drained soils formed in glacial till of mixed mineralogy.  Karta soils occupy toeslopes and footslopes of valleys, and the lower backslopes and footslopes of mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 100 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 110 inches.",
