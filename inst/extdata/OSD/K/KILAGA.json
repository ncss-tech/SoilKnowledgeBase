  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to duripan or stratified alluvium is 40 to 80 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 65 degrees F.  and usually is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  The soil between depths of 5 to 15 inches is usually dry in all parts from May 15 until October 15, and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 5/3, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/6 or 5/4 and moist colors of 10YR 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 3/4; 5YR 3/4, 4/4.  This horizon has more than 1.2 percent organic matter in the upper 4 inches and decreases with depth.  Texture is clay loam, loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.  The lower boundary is gradual with a gradual clay increase between the A and Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2; 5YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 5/3, 4/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 3/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/2; 5YR 3/4, 4/4; 2.5YR 3/4.  Textures are heavy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, sandy clay or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Structure is blocky or prismatic.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Manganese stains appear randomly in the Bt horizon."

The Argonaut, Conosta and Fancher soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Contra Costa soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Phipps soils are on dissected hills and have 5 to 30 percent gravel throughout.   Trabuco soils are on foothills and have 5 to 35 percent coarse fragment in the series control section."

They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is 46 degrees F.; average July temperature is 79 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 250 to 300 days."
