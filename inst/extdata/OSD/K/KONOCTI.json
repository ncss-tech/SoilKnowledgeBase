  "OVERVIEW": "The Konocti series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material derived dominantly from andesite, basalt and dacite.  Konocti soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

The soil between a depth of 6 and 20 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to October 15, and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30.  Reaction slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2; 10YR 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4 or 10YR 3/3.  It is loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam or stony loam.  Total rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent and consist of 5 to 25 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.  It is 3 to 8 inches thick and is either too thin and/or too low in organic matter in the lower part to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  Some pedons lack a B1 horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  It is stony loam, very stony loam, very stony clay loam or very stony sandy clay loam with 22 to 35 percent clay.  Total rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent and consist of 5 to 20 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 30 percent stones.  Rock fragments content averages 35 to 55 percent in the upper 20 inches.  Base saturation (sum of cations) ranges from 60 to 80 percent and is less than 75 percent in at least some part.  Some pedons lack a Bct and/or C horizon."

Also in subsequent revisions and other lists, the series is spelled Konokti.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET"
