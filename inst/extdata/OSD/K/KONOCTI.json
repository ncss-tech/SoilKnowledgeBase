    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 15 to 40 inches and the depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The soil between a depth of 6 and 20 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to October 15, and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30.  Reaction slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2; 10YR 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4 or 10YR 3/3.  It is loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam or stony loam.  Total rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent and consist of 5 to 25 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.  It is 3 to 8 inches thick and is either too thin and/or too low in organic matter in the lower part to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  Some pedons lack a B1 horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  It is stony loam, very stony loam, very stony clay loam or very stony sandy clay loam with 22 to 35 percent clay.  Total rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent and consist of 5 to 20 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 30 percent stones.  Rock fragments content averages 35 to 55 percent in the upper 20 inches.  Base saturation (sum of cations) ranges from 60 to 80 percent and is less than 75 percent in at least some part.  Some pedons lack a Bct and/or C horizon."

The spelling \"Konocti\" represents the presently accepted spelling of Mt. Konocti.  In the 1927 Clear Lake Area, California Soil Survey report the name is spelled Konokti.  Also in subsequent revisions and other lists, the series is spelled Konokti.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled by the National Soil Survey Laboratory, July 1978.  Profile number is S78CA-033-022; NSSL Pedon No.  457.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
