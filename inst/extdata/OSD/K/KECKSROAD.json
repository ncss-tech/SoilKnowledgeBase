  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between depths of 6 and 17 inches is dry in all parts from April 15 until December 1 and is moist in some part for less than 60 consecutive days in winter.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The soil is slightly to violently effervescent throughout the profile.  Carbonates are usually disseminated in the surface horizons and segregated in the lower horizons.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent and is usually less than 25 mm in diameter.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/3, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, or 4/3.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Clay percentage is 30 to 45.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  EC x 1000 ranges from 0.2 to 1.  Organic matter content is less than 1 percent.  Structure is moderate to strong blocky or prismatic.  Some areas have a surface horizon less than 1-inch thick that has platy structure.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/3, 6/6, 6/4, 6/3, or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/6, 5/5, 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, or 4/3.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  Clay percentage is 35 to 50.  The increase in clay from the A horizon to the B2t horizon is 3 to 6 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  EC x 103 is less than 2.  Structure is subangular blocky or prismatic.  In some pedons there is a C horizon above the paralithic contact.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/3, 6/6, 6/4, 6/3, or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/6, 5/4, 4/4, or 4/3.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Clay percentage is 35 to 50.  EC x 103 ranges from 0.2 to 1.  Structure is weak or moderate blocky; some horizons are structureless."
