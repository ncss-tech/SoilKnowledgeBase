  "OVERVIEW": "The Kezan series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty alluvial sediments derived from loess and glacial till. These soils occur on flood plains of narrow upland drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters (28 inches) at the type location.",
