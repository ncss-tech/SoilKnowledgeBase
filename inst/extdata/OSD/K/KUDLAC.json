  "OVERVIEW": "The Kudlac series consists of soils that are well drained and very deep, that formed in lacustrine sediments from mixed sources. They are on terraces and breaks. Permeability is very slow. Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
