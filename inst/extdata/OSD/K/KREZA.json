  "OVERVIEW": "The Kreza series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale, slate, and schist with additions of calcareous eolian material.  Kreza soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Bombadil soils are not calcareous in the argillic horizon.  Dougal soils have slightly acid soil reaction in the argillic horizon.  Fubble soils have lithic contacts at 36 to 50 cm from the soil surface and have identifiable secondary carbonates.  Jaybee soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Meninik soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C and have moderately acid or slightly acid soil reaction above the argillic horizon.  In addition, none of these soils have pararock fragments of schist in the particle-size control section."
