Bombadil soils are not calcareous in the argillic horizon.  Dougal soils have slightly acid soil reaction in the argillic horizon.  Fubble soils have lithic contacts at 36 to 50 cm from the soil surface and have identifiable secondary carbonates.  Jaybee soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Meninik soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C and have moderately acid or slightly acid soil reaction above the argillic horizon.  In addition, none of these soils have pararock fragments of schist in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kreza soils are on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum derived from shale, slate, and schist with additions of calcareous eolian material.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,800 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
