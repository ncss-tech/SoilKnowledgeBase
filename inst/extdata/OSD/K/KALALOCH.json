  "OVERVIEW": "The Kalaloch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium over glacial outwash. These soils are on river terraces and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 120 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
