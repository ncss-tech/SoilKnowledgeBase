The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 140 inches. Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F, average July temperature is about 61 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 140 to 220 days."

Andic soil properties extend from 4 to 29 inches.  This series includes sandy and sandy-skeletal particle-size classes in the lower part of the particle-size control section.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nIn 2007 the type location was move to the pedon as described in the 1975 Soil Survey for Jefferson County Area, Washington.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
