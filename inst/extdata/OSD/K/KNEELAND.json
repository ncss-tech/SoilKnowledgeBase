    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe effective rooting depth is 25 to 45 inches.\nThe A horizon ranges in color from brown to dark grayish brown or grayish brown and from sandy loam to light clay loam. This horizon ranges from moderate, fine, granular structure to moderate, medium, subangular blocky structure. Reaction is moderately acid to strongly acid, and ranges in thickness from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe B horizon ranges from pale brown to yellowish brown or brownish yellow in color, and from heavy loam to clay loam. The structure ranges from weak, fine, and granular to weak, coarse, and subangular blocky, or the soil is massive. This horizon is moderately acid to strongly acid. It is from 15 to 25 inches thick, Occasionally, a layer of thin gravel or small rock fragments separates the A horizon from the B horizon.\nThe R horizon is pale-brown to light yellowish-brown hard sandstone with streaks of weakly consolidated sandy clay loam."
