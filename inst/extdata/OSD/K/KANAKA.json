The A horizon colors are grayish brown and brown to light yellowish brown and reddish yellow in 10YR and 7.5YR hues and have values of 5 and 6 dry and 4 moist.  Chromas are 3 and 4 dry and 2 to 4 moist.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to cobbly sandy loam and reaction from strongly acid to medium acid.  The B2 horizon colors are very pale brown or pink, light brown and reddish yellow in 10YR and 7.5YR hues with values of 6 and 7 and chromas of 4 and 6 dry.  Colors moist are brown and strong brown with values of 5 and 6 and chromas of 4 and 6. Texture ranges from sandy loam to heavy loam and reaction from very strongly acid to strongly acid."

The Behemotosh soils have medium acid, very cobbly light clay loam Bt horizons.  The Chawanakee soils lack B2 horizons and have very coarse sandy loam textures.  The Diamond Springs soils have reddish yellow and yellowish red (moist) heavy sandy loam very strongly acid Bt horizons.  The Shaver soils have 0 horizons and an umbric epipedon."
