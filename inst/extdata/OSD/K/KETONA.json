  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth of limestone bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges\nfrom slightly acid to moderately alkaline in all horizons.  Some pedons have recent alluvial sediments deposited over the A1\nhorizons.  All horizons except the recent alluvial layers crack\nwhen dry.  Many pedons contain small, round, brown, or black concretions and limestone fragments.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe A2 or B1 horizon, where present, is silt loam, silty clay\nloam, or clay loam.  These horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or less.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 3\nthrough 6, and chroma of 2 or less, or it is mottled in shades of brown, gray, and yellow.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  In some pedons, the percent of mottles increases with depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Pocola series is the only other series in\nthe same family.  Pocola soils are not underlain by limestone\nbedrock and are somewhat poorly drained.  In addition, Pocola\nsoils lack clay decreases of more than 20 percent within 60 inches and have perched water tables.  Dowellton soils are similar to\nKetona soils except they are in a very fine textural class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ketona soils are on flood plains,\ndrainageways of upland flats, and depressional areas in limestone valleys.  Slope is dominantly 0 to 2 percent, but ranges to 4 percent.  These soils formed in old clayey alluvium and residuum\nfrom limestone.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Bodine, Collegedale, Decatur, Fullerton, Sullivan, and Tupelo series.  Bodine, Collegedale, Decatur, and Fullerton soils are on uplands, do not\nhave seasonal water tables, and do not have matrix chroma of 2 or less in their argillic horizon.  Sullivan soils are on adjacent\nflood plains, are fine loamy, and do not have matrix chroma of 2\nor less in the upper part of the solum.  Tupelo soils are on\nupland flats, are somewhat poorly to moderately well drained, and have a subhorizon with matrix chroma of 3 or more."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff and\npermeability are slow.  A seasonal water table is at or near the surface during winter and spring.  These soils are subject to frequent brief flooding due to stream overflow or ponding due to\nslow runoff or lack of drainage outlets."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Ketona soils are used for\nhardwood forest and pastureland.  Some areas have been converted\nto urban use."

S. A."
