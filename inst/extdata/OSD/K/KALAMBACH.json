  "OVERVIEW": "The Kalambach series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of silty loess over friable to firm very gravelly glacial till material.  Kalambach soils are on till plains and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

Texture of the loess mantle is silt loam or very fine sandy loam with less than 10 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The solum is 13 to 25 inches thick.  The glacial till substratum has greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and 30 to 60 percent coarse fragments.  The control section has a weighted average of less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid in the solum and slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.  MAST ranges from 33 to 37 degrees F.\nThe AE, and A horizon if present, have moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma from 4 through 6.\nThe BC horizon has moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma from 2 through 4.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content includes 30 to 45 percent subangular gravel and 5 to 20 percent subangular cobble."
