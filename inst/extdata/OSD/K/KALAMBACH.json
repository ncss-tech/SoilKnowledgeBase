  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to very gravelly glacial till ranges from 12 to 22 inches.  Texture of the loess mantle is silt loam or very fine sandy loam with less than 10 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The solum is 13 to 25 inches thick.  The glacial till substratum has greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and 30 to 60 percent coarse fragments.  The control section has a weighted average of less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid in the solum and slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.  MAST ranges from 33 to 37 degrees F.\nThe AE, and A horizon if present, have moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma from 4 through 6.\nThe BC horizon has moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma from 2 through 4.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content includes 30 to 45 percent subangular gravel and 5 to 20 percent subangular cobble."
