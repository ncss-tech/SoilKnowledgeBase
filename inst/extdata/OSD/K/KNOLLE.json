Littleaxe soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.  Minerva soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  Stephenville soils have sandstone bedrock within 40 inches.  Weatherford soils do not have dark coatings on the surfaces of peds in the argillic horizon.  Hye and Konawa soils have mixed mineralogy.  Klump soils have a mollic epipedon.  Konsil soils have an argillic horizon that does not decrease in clay content within 60 inches.  Silawa soils have argillic horizons with slightly redder hue, do not have brownish iron depletions and are in the semiactive family."
