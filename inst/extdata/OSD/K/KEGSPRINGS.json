  "OVERVIEW": "The Kegsprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed igneous and interbedded, sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
