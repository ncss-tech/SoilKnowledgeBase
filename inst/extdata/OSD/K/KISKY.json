  "OVERVIEW": "The Kisky series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks and rhyolite. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent in foothills, mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
