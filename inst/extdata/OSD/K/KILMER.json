    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact of massive sandstone or shale is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 63 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 6 and 18 inches is usually moist in all parts from December 1 until March 1 and dry in all parts from April 15 until November 15.  Moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.  The soils are dry for more than 200 days.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 2.5Y 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, or 4/4.  It is loam or clay loam and has 15 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline (pH 7.4-8.4).  It is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent with disseminated lime.  Gravel content is less than 15 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, or 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/4, 4/3, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent with disseminated lime.  Some pedons lack segregated lime.  Gravel content is less than 15 percent."

Arburua soils are dry for only 90 to 120 days.  Balcom soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 23 to 40 inches and have a cambic horizon.  Calleguas soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Garretson soils are non-acid and lack a lithic or paralithic contact.  Hillbrick soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Kettleman soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Mendi soils have a paralithic contact at a depth greater than 60 inches.  San Emigdio and San Timoteo soils are coarse-loamy.  Shedd soils are in the fine-silty family and have chroma of 2 or less."

The soils formed in material weathered from massive unfractured shale or sandstone.  Elevations are 200 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Mean January temperature is 44 degrees F., mean July temperature is 83 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.
