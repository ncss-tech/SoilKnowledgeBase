  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kuslina series consists of very poorly or poorly drained soils formed in a thick organic mat overlying a thin loess mantle underlain by stratified loamy alluvium.  Kuslina soils are on stream terraces.  Permafrost occurs at a depth of 5 to 14 inches below the surface of the mineral soil.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of fibrous moss over partially decomposed moss, twigs, and roots 8 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 5 to 14 inches below the mineral soil surface two months after the summer solstice.  Composite texture of the stratified particle size control section is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  There is less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section.  The organic mat is strongly or moderately acid and the mineral soil is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 1, 2, 3, or 4; and moist chroma of 1, 2 or 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include mucky silt loam, silt or very fine sandy loam. Color stratification is common in this horizon due to variable organic matter content within the loess strata, however, organic matter content does not exceed 12 percent.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures are stratified and include very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, sand and loamy fine sand.  Dark colors are due to the high concentration of black sand grains.  Coarse fragment content is less than 5 percent. Sandy textures and gravelly strata become more common with increasing depth."

Copper River, Deborah, and Saulich soils have silty textures with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Mendeltna soils have more than 18 percent clay.  Tolsona soils are not stratified.  Umiat soils have weathered bedrock within the control section."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall ranges from 39 to 68 inches.

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly or poorly drained. Runoff is slow. Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic mat, moderate in the loess mantle and moderately rapid in the mineral soil above the permafrost.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is destroyed by fire or clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level and subsequent lowering of the water table."
