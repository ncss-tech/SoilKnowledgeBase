  "OVERVIEW": "The Klootch series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils formed in material weathered from granite with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountains and have slopes ranging from 15 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
