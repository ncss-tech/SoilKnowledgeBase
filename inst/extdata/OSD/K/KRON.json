The mean annual soil temperature is 56 to 58 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The difference between mean winter and mean summer temperatures is less than 9 degrees F. Organic matter content is greater than 1 percent throughout the profile. The soil between the depth of 4 to 12 inches is moist throughout the profile from mid-November to June. It is dry in some or all parts the rest of the time but is not dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days. Gravel content ranges from 5 to 15 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, or 5/3 and moist colors of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, or 3/3. Textures are loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. The clay content ranges from 15 to 20 percent.  Reaction is slightly to moderately acid."
