  "OVERVIEW": "The Koppes series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granodiorite. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 20 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 mm, and the mean annul temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
