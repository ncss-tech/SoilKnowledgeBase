Lab data was run at the Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory in Manhattan, Kansas.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (A2, A3, A4, horizons)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 16 to 42 inches.  (A1, A2, A3, A4 horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: In the zone from 23 to 42 inches. (A2, A3, AC horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2C horizon. Between 40 to 60 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
