  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bernhill, Underwood, Ulhalf, and Wilkeson soils. Bernhill soils are more than 60 inches deep and have subrounded rock fragments of glacial till origin. Underwood and Wilkeson soils are more than 60 inches deep and are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section. Ulhalf soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments and a sandy loam texture in the surface horizon, Hues of 5YR, and have paralithic materials of basalt, andesite, or other metavolcanic origin."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kramerhill soils are on convex footslopes and backslopes of mountains and foothills at elevations of 1,900 to 3,100 feet. Slopes are 3 to 55 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, or Latah Formation, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 66 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Dearyton soils are on foothills and uplands and are fine and very deep. Glenrose soils are on foothills and outwash plains, are very deep, and have a mollic epipedon. Green Bluff soils are on outwash plains over basalt plateaus and are coarse-loamy. Spokane soils are on foothills, mountains, and ridgetops, are coarse-loamy, and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact."

Investigation into further use of this series in Stevens, and the Colville Indian Reservation will be needed as these surveys are updated.\nKramerhill soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
