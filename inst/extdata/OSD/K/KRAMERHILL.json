  "OVERVIEW": "The Kramerhill series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, or Latah Formation, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Kramerhill soils are on convex footslopes and backslopes of mountains and foothills. Slope ranges from 3 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Investigation into further use of this series in Stevens, and the Colville Indian Reservation will be needed as these surveys are updated.\nKramerhill soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed)."
