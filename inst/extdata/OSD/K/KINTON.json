  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F.  The depth to the fragipan ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon to depths 3 to 8 inches has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 dry.  Below 3 to 8 inches the A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The field texture is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Measured clay is less than 15 percent as a weighed average but the 15 bar water (percentage) ranges from about 8 to 10 and the ratio of measured clay to 15 bar water is about 1 to 1.6 in the B horizon.  A few faint redox concentrations with chroma of 3 or 4 in hue of 5 YR or 7.5YR are near the boundary with the fragipan in some pedons.\nThe 2Btx horizon has matrix colors similar to the horizons above to it but has faint to prominent redox concentrations with chroma of more than 2 and tongue with chroma of 2.  It is firm or very firm and brittle and has few to many faint to distinct clay films on many faces of peds.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and commonly is 2 feet or more thick.  A dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) buried clay soil underlies the fragipan in some areas."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kinton soils are on smooth or rolling low hills with convex, long slopes and ridgetops on all exposures.  The soils formed in loess like material over fine, silty old alluvium of mixed origin.  The soils are at 250 to 400 feet elevation and formed under cool moist winter and a warm dry summer climate. The average July temperature is 66 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 39 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The frost free period is 165 to 210 days."
