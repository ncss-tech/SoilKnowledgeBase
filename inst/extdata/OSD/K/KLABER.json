Rock fragments are less than 5 percent.\nThe A and Eg horizons have value of 2 through 7 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. They have moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. The Eg horizon is 4 to 6 inches thick.  These horizon is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe E/Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry. The A2 portion is silt loam or silty clay loam and occupies 50 to 75 percent of the volume. The B portion is silty clay loam or silty clay and has 35 to 42 percent clay.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klaber soils are on nearly level poorly drained areas on glacial terraces at elevations of 100 to 1,000 feet. The soils formed in mixed material from glacial and sedimentary sources. These soils occur in a climate with 40 to 70 inches annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain in the winter. The mean January temperature is 37 degrees F., mean July temperature is 64 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 125 to 200 days."

Cinebar and Glenoma soils formed in material high in volcanic ash.  Galvin and Scamman soils are somewhat poorly drained and Galvin soils lack an albic horizon. Olequa and Salkum soils are well drained."
