    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klaber soils are on nearly level poorly drained areas on glacial terraces at elevations of 100 to 1,000 feet. The soils formed in mixed material from glacial and sedimentary sources. These soils occur in a climate with 40 to 70 inches annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain in the winter. The mean January temperature is 37 degrees F., mean July temperature is 64 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 125 to 200 days."

Cinebar and Glenoma soils formed in material high in volcanic ash.  Galvin and Scamman soils are somewhat poorly drained and Galvin soils lack an albic horizon. Olequa and Salkum soils are well drained."
