    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kious soils are on mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,160 to 3,200 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
