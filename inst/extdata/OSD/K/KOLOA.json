  "OVERVIEW": "The Koloa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from volcanic ash and basic igneous rock.  Koloa soils are on low elevation, mountain hillslopes, ridges, and volcanic vents; and, have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 1,270 millimeters (50 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.)",

Some pedons may be deeper than 102 centimeters (40 inches).  Fine black concretions range from none to many in the A and B horizons.  The soil is slightly acid to neutral throughout the soil profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It may be violently to strongly effervescent with hydrogen peroxide.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It may be strongly to very slightly effervescent with hydrogen peroxide.\nClay films may not be present in all pedons."
