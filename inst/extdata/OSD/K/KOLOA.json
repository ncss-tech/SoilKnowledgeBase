The soil is slightly acid to neutral throughout the soil profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It may be violently to strongly effervescent with hydrogen peroxide.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It may be strongly to very slightly effervescent with hydrogen peroxide.\nClay films may not be present in all pedons."
