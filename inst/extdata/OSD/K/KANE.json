  "OVERVIEW": "The Kane series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash over stratified calcareous gravel and sand. These soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

The depth to horizons with greater than 60 percent sand and greater than 15 percent rock fragments ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). The silty mantle is 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) thick. The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) in thickness.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam, or less commonly sandy loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is clay loam or loam, but includes silty clay loam in the upper part when the silty mantle is present. It averages 25 to 35 percent clay. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt or 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam and is commonly stratified. Clay content ranges from 15 to 30 percent, sand content ranges from 30 to 60 percent, and gravel content ranges from 5 to 15 percent. Some pedons have a \"beta\" horizon that is somewhat darker colored than the 2Bt or 2BC horizon. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It ranges from gravelly loamy sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

A surface mantle of silty material as much as 51 cm (20 inches) thick is present in many places.

Kane soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Warsaw, poorly drained Will, and the poorly and very poorly drained Sebewa soils. On nearby landforms are the Dresden, Matherton, Fox, Ionia, Homer, and Lorenzo soils. The well drained Dresden and the somewhat poorly drained Matherton soils are mollic intergrades to Alfisols formed in similar materials. The well drained Fox, moderately well drained Ionia, and somewhat poorly drained Homer soils lack mollic epipedons and formed in similar materials. The Lorenzo soils are well drained."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum, and very high (greater than 141.11 micrometers per second) in the underlying material.
