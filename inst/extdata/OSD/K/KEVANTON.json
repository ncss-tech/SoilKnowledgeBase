    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 40 to 48 inches. The depth to bedrock is 44 to 60 inches or more. A very weakly cemented silica hardpan is present below 40 inches in some pedons. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 degrees to 46 degrees F.; and the mean summer temperature is 61 degrees to 66 degrees F. The soil is usually moist, but is dry within the 4- to 12-inch depth for about 60 to 75 consecutive days in the summer and autumn. Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some part of the soil above depth of 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam and average 18 to 25 percent clay and more than 15 percent of the particles coarser than very fine sand. The IIB22tb horizon has an increase of more than 25 percent clay (absolute) over the horizon above. clay content is 45 to 60 percent. Hue is 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. It is loam or sandy loam."

The soils formed in eolian sand and underlying clayey material weathered from basalt. mean annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches including 3 to 5 feet of snowfall.  Mean annual temperature is 41 degrees to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
