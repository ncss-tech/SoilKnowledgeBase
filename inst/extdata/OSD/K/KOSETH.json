    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist in all horizons during part of the year but is dry in all parts between depths of 8 to 24 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days during summer and autumn. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F. The particle-size control section has 15 to 35 percent rounded pebbles and cobbles. The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3. It has fine, medium or coarse granular, or very fine and fine subangular blocky structure. Gravel ranges from 5 to 10 percent. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist. It has fine to coarse subangular blocky structure. Gravel ranges from 15 to 25 percent. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist. It has fine to coarse subangular blocky structure. Gravel ranges from 15 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4. Gravel ranges from 15 to 30 percent in the upper part and from 35 to 50 percent in the lower part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Koseth soils are on glaciated uplands, glaciated hillsides and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,600 to 4,000 feet. Slopes are usually undulating, rolling, or convex and range from 15 to 65 percent. Aspect is mostly southerly. These soils formed in till from limestone and fine and medium textured calcareous shaly rock with a component of volcanic ash and loess in the upper horizons. Koseth soils are in a continental climate having but dry summers and cool moist winters. The average annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 30 inches; and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
