  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The mottles in the control section are not considered to be redoximorphic features. Base saturation of the typical pedon is borderline the Alfisol and Ultisol Order. A summary of base saturation data indicates that the classification of this series should be in the ultic subgroup of Alfisols. Particle-size data shows that this series borders the fine-silty and fine family, and possibly having illitic mineralogy. The CEC activity class assigned is semiactive, but lab data indicates the range to be both in active and semiactive.\nRepresentative Component and horizon data is in DMU# 124507.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1) ochric epipedon - the zone from approximately 3 to 33 cm (1 to 13 inches) (A, E, BE horizons); 2) argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 33 to 94 cm (13 to 37 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); and 3) paralithic contact at 119 cm (47 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data from Purdue Soils Laboratory number S78IN71-6-(1-7), File No. JN8061 (typical pedon). Lab data available for sample no. S90IN-143-1 from the NSSL in Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
