  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaman series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These nearly level soils occur on floodplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",
