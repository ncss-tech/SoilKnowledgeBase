    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sandy and gravelly material typically is 20 to 30 inches but ranges from 14 to 38 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is loam and neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam averaging 18 to 25 percent clay.  It is neutral.  It does not have thin layers of sandy loam in the lower part of some pedons.  The entire Bw horizon has redoximorphic features in some pedons.  Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon less than 5 inches thick.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2.  It has more than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction.  It is stratified and commonly has more than 35 percent rock fragments but the content ranges from 2 to 70 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kensal soils are on level and nearly level outwash plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in loam materials over sand and gravel sediments that contain an appreciable amount of shale.  The climate is cool, subhumid, with a mean air annual temperature of about 38 to 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation of about 16 to 20 inches.  Two-thirds of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the competing Warsing soils and the Brantford, Coe, Divide, Tolna and Walum soils on nearby outwash plains. Brantford soils do not have redoximorphic features.  Coe soils are sandy-skeletal.  They are on steeper slopes and hills.  Divide soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches.  Tolna soils are more acid and are coarse-loamy.  Walum soils are sandy."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 14 to 24 inches (Bw2 and Bw3 horizons).\nThe classification was changed to the Oxyaquic subgroup even though the morphology of this pedon may meet the Aquic subgroup criteria because it was felt Oxyaquic better fit the water state of the series.  A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series.  01/2000.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to SU64ND-14-2 and ND52-P-3.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
