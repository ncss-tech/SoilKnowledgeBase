    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Assumption, Aviston, Barrington, Blackberry, Buckhart, Catlin, Clare, Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont, Harrison, Saybrook, and Totanang series. None of the competing series have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). In addition, Assumption, Catlin, Dana, and Saybrook soils formed in loess and the underlying till and contain less clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Barrington soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy outwash and contain less clay in the lower part of the series control section. Harrison soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy sediments at the surface of Illinoian till that contains a strongly weathered paleosol and have less clay in the lower part of the series control section."

Keltner soils formed in 30 to 50 inches of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from calcareous clayey shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 914 mm (32 to 36 inches)."

Calamine soils are poorly drained, dominated by grayer colors and are on nearly level parts of the broader ridges. Loran soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on similar landscape positions. Massbach soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions. Schapville soils have shale bedrock within 102 cm (40 inches) and are on similar landscape positions. Tama soils are well drained, do not have shale bedrock within 152 cm (60 inches), and are on upper side slopes or ridge tops above Keltner soils."

Permeability is moderate in the loess and slow in the residuum.  The depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 91 cm (2 to 3 feet) during February to June in normal years."
