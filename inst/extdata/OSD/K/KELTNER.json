  "OVERVIEW": "The Keltner series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on unglaciated hillside benches and rounded ridge tops.  These soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum weathered from shale.  The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",

None of the competing series have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). In addition, Assumption, Catlin, Dana, and Saybrook soils formed in loess and the underlying till and contain less clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Barrington soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy outwash and contain less clay in the lower part of the series control section. Harrison soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy sediments at the surface of Illinoian till that contains a strongly weathered paleosol and have less clay in the lower part of the series control section."

Massbach soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions. Schapville soils have shale bedrock within 102 cm (40 inches) and are on similar landscape positions. Tama soils are well drained, do not have shale bedrock within 152 cm (60 inches), and are on upper side slopes or ridge tops above Keltner soils."
