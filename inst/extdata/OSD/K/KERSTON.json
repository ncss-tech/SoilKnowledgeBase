  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kerston soils are in nearly level or slightly depressed glacial drainageways and flood plains (first bottoms) of slowly flowing streams. They are most extensive near the confluence of these streams with other bodies of water. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Kerston soils formed in 41 to 76 cm (16 to 30 inches) of organic materials overlying alternating layers of organic and mineral materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 914 mm (30 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F)."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. The water table is typically the same as that of the adjacent stream. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the sapric material and high or very high in the mineral material. Permeability of the sapric material ranges from moderately slow to moderately rapid and the mineral material has rapid permeability."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The greater part of this soil is in native vegetation, which consists of marsh grasses, sedges, reeds, and shrubs. Some areas have a poor quality lowland hardwood forest including American elm, white ash, cottonwood, red and silver maple. Other areas are drained and planted to high value crops such as celery, carrots, onions, lettuce, and mint."
