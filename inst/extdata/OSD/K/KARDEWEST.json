    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kardewest soils are on lake plains, relict lakebeds, and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits weathered from mixed sources. Elevation is 1,949 to 1,975 meters (6,394 to 6,480 feet). Mean annual precipitation is 254 to 356 millimeters (10 to 14 inches). The mean annual temperature is 9.4 to 11.7 degrees C (49 to 53 degrees F). Frost free season is 120 to 140 days. This area shows evidence of past sustained inundation with water, and some profiles show redox concentrations. The water table was within 24 inches of the surface and the soils were poorly drained. Lengthy periods of drought have caused the water table to fall below depths of 20 feet."
