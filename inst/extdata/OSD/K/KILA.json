  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kila series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium, outwash or glaciolacustrine deposits over till. These soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces, lake terraces, and moraines in mountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
