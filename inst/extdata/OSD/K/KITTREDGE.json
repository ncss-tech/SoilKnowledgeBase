  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kittredge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed material derived from schist, gneiss, and interbedded granitic rock.  Kittredge soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans, and concave drainages and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010."
