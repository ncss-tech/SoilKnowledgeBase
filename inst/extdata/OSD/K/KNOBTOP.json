  "OVERVIEW": "The Knobtop series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum from igneous rock. These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.",

It is very strongly acid or strongly acid, and ranges up to neutral where limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Some pedons have a BA or BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value or 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6 with the lower part mottled. It is silt loam or silty clay loam or clay loam and strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 2Bt or 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma is commonly 2 but ranges from 2 to 6. If the matrix has chroma of 3 to 6, it has mottles with chroma of 2. If the matrix has chroma of 2, brighter mottles are present. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, gravelly silt loam , gravelly silty clay loam, cobbly clay loam or the cobbly or very cobbly analogues of silt loam. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid."

Loughboro soils are poorly drained and are on nearly level areas at the foot of the mountains."
