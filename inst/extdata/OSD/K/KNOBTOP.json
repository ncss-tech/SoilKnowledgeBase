  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragment content is 0 to 25 percent for the A, E and Bt horizons and 5 to 65 percent for the 2BC horizon. Some pedons are stony on the surface.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid, and ranges up to neutral where limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Some pedons have a BA or BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value or 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6 with the lower part mottled. It is silt loam or silty clay loam or clay loam and strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 2Bt or 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma is commonly 2 but ranges from 2 to 6. If the matrix has chroma of 3 to 6, it has mottles with chroma of 2. If the matrix has chroma of 2, brighter mottles are present. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, gravelly silt loam , gravelly silty clay loam, cobbly clay loam or the cobbly or very cobbly analogues of silt loam. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Knobtop soils are on ridgetops of mountainous areas. A silty overburden, presumably loess, has weathered to grade into a weakly expressed discontinuity of residuum from acid felsitic or similar igneous rock. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 44 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Delassus, Irondale, and Loughboro series. Delassus soils have fragipans and are at lower elevations. Irondale soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the upper argillic horizon and commonly are on steeper slopes surrounding the Knobtop soils. Loughboro soils are poorly drained and are on nearly level areas at the foot of the mountains."
