    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kantishna soils occupy depressions in broad alluvial plains in interior and western Alaska.  They are level, but scattered low peat mounds occur; the organic material in these mounds are perennially frozen below about 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 24 to 30 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bradway, Goldstream, Inmachuk, Lemeta, and Volkmar soils.  Bradway soils have stratified layers of sand and silt loam over permafrost.  Goldstream soils have thick layers of organic material over silt loam and shallow permafrost.  Inmachuk soils consist of fibrous sedge peat over ice-rich permafrost.  Lemeta soils have a thick layer of Sphagnum moss peat over fibrous sedge peat and permafrost.  Volkmar soils are on terraces and consist of mottled silt loam over a sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum.  Open ponds are common within bodies of peat."
