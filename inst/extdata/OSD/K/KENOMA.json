The soils formed in loess and or old alluvial sediments over residuum from Pennsylvanian age shale or limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 13 to 18 degrees C (55 to 64 degrees F). Frost-free period is 175 to 225 days. Elevation is 220 to 465 meters (722 to 1525 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 60 to 80."

Dennis, Eram, and Summit soils are typically on lower topographic positions than Kenoma soils. Olpe soils occur on steeper areas and have more than 35 percent rounded coarse fragments by volume in their control section. The somewhat poorly drained Woodson soils occur on slightly concave areas above the Kenoma soils."
