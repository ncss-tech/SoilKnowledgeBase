  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenoma series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess and/or old alluvial sediments over residuum from Pennsylvanian age shale and limestone.  Kenoma soils are on plains or terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",
