Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to the sandy substratum ranges from 26 to 60 inches.     Volume of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the sandy mantle and in the sandy substratum.  Coarse fragments are absent in the clayey lacustrine material.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the soil.  Redox accumulations occur within 40 inches and saturation occurs within 40 inches for some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the A or Ap horizon is sand or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 3 to 6.  Bw horizons with spodic color have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.   Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  The weighted average clay content ranges from 50 to 80 percent in the argillic horizon.  Thin subhorizons with less than 60 percent clay occur in some pedons.  The clay fraction is dominantly smectite.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay. Some pedons have thin strata of silt, silt loam, very fine sand, or fine sand.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Karlsborg soils are on glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on  lake plains or outwash plains.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 42 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from 110 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 1100 feet."

The poorly drained Dody (T) soils and the somewhat poorly drained Meenon (T) soils form a drainage sequence with Karlsborg soils.  The moderately well drained Perida soils are on slightly higher landscape positions where the sandy outwash mantle is more than 40 inches thick over the clayey lacustrine deposits."

Permeability is rapid in the sandy outwash mantle, very slow or slow in the clayey lacustrine deposits and rapid in the sandy substratum.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3 feet for 1 month or more at some time during the period of October to May in 6 or more out of 10 years."
