  "OVERVIEW": "The Karlsborg series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep to clayey lacustrine deposits.  These soils formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on lake plains or outwash plains.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, very slow or slow in the clayey lacustrine deposits, and rapid in the sandy substratum.  Slopes range from 1 to 30  percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to the sandy substratum ranges from 26 to 60 inches.     Volume of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the sandy mantle and in the sandy substratum.  Coarse fragments are absent in the clayey lacustrine material.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the soil.  Redox accumulations occur within 40 inches and saturation occurs within 40 inches for some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the A or Ap horizon is sand or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 3 to 6.  Bw horizons with spodic color have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.
