The thickness of the loess or silty sediments ranges from 89 to 140 cm (35 to 55 inches). The particle-size control section averages between 35 and about 42 percent clay. Sand content in the loess or silty material is less than 15 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2. It is silt loam.\nThe Bt and Btg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. At least one horizon between the Ap and 76 cm (30 inches) does not have chroma of 2 or less in 60 percent of the matrix. This horizon commonly occurs in the upper part of the B horizon. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. It has redoximorphic features and has chroma of 2 or less either in the matrix or as redox depletions. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2BC or 2BCg horizon.\nThe 2Cd or 2Cdg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 1020 mm (32 to 40 inches), frost free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 155 to 311 m (510 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

Wenona and Rutland soils formed in similar materials but have mollic epipedons and on similar positions nearby. Streator soils formed in low, wet areas and are poorly drained. Swygert and Nappanee soils both formed primarily in silty clay glacial till and are on nearby landscapes."

An intermittent perched high water table is at a depth of 15 to 61 cm (0.5 foot to 2.0 feet) at some time between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low on level areas and medium or high on sloping areas. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the series control section and moderately low or moderately high (0.14 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the series control section and very slow or slow in the lower part."
