  "OVERVIEW": "The Kernan series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess or silty sediments and in the underlying clayey till or lakebed sediments. These soils are on till plains or lake beds. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 915 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
