    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The volcanic ash accumulation is more than 40 inches thick.  The ash may be mottled, especially in the upper 20 inches.  Texture in the uppermost layer and throughout the profile ranges from silt loam to fine sand.  The underlying material is usually silty alluvium, but may be coarse sand, gravel, or peat."

The climate is cool maritime.  Averageannual preci itation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

Kalsin soils are formed in moderately deep to deep, dark silty alluvial material.  Salonie soils are formed in shallow silty alluvial material overlying gravel.:"

More data is needed to define the central concept or the series should be inactivated (jpm, 4/87).\nSource of the volcanic ash is the 1912 eruption of Mt. Novarupta and Mt.  Katmai on the Alaska Peninsula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
