  "REVDATE": "05/2022",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kizhuyak series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium consisting of volcanic ash.  Kizhuyak soils are on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The volcanic ash accumulation is more than 40 inches thick.  The ash may be mottled, especially in the upper 20 inches.  Texture in the uppermost layer and throughout the profile ranges from silt loam to fine sand.  The underlying material is usually silty alluvium, but may be coarse sand, gravel, or peat."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kizhuyak soils are on floodplains near the mouths of streams.  The parent material is volcanic ash washed from hills bordering the floodplains.  The climate is cool maritime.  Averageannual preci itation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

Kalsin soils are formed in moderately deep to deep, dark silty alluvial material.  Salonie soils are formed in shallow silty alluvial material overlying gravel.:"
