  "OVERVIEW": "The Kimpton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium over residuum derived from hard fine grained sandstone or fine grained igneous rock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, ridges, hills, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
