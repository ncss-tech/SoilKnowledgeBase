The soils are noncalcareous throughout. The control section is sandy loam with more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser in the upper part and sand in the lower part averaging loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Coarse angular sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in size are 5 to 15 percent. The A and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. They are neutral or mildly alkaline."
