The thickness of the solum ranges from 127 to 178 cm (50 to 70 inches) and is the same as the depth to calcareous sand and gravel. The combined thickness of the silty material and loamy outwash material is 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) over the gravelly outwash material. The thickness of the mollic epipedon and the upper silty layer ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches).\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt or 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value or 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Clay content is 20 to 32 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in all layers above 102 cm (40 inches), and 5 to 25 percent in layers below 102 cm (40 inches). Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam.

Cresco and Penfield soils have iron depletions in the third part of the series control section. Cresent, Jasper, Keosauqua, Morrill, and Schoolcraft soils do not have horizons with more than 20 percent gravel within the series control section. Durand, Joslin, Pana, and Winnebago soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the second part of the series control section.
