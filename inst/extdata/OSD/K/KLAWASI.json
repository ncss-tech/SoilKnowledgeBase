  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of fibrous moss and roots over partially decomposed organic material 9 to 14 inches thick.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 14 to 30 inches below the surface of the mineral soil two months after the summer solstice. Saturated conditions occur at 9 to 17 inches below the surface of the organic mat.  There is more than 35 percent clay by weighted average in the particle size control section.  Textures include silt loam, silty clay, and clay.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  The surface horizons are slightly acid to mildly alkaline. The substratum  is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR  or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam but includes mucky silt loam or silt.  Striations and lenses of organic material are common in many pedons.\nThe AB horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  Texture is commonly silt loam but includes silt, mucky silt loam, and loam.  Striations and lenses of organic material are present in many pedons.  Oxidation mottles are present in some pedons.  The AB horizon is absent in some profiles.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures include silty clay and clay. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent with 0 to 10 percent cobble and 0 to 20 percent gravel.  A lag concentration of coarse fragments is common along the upper boundary of the horizon. Ice content in the 2Cf horizon is variable and includes disseminated or segregated ice crystals or thin seams.  Disseminated lime and occasional soft masses are evident in the 2Cf horizon and become more prevalent with depth."

Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall ranges from 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."

Mendeltna soils have loam and clay loam textures and are on lacustrine terraces higher than Klawasi soils.  Wrangell soils are organic soils and are in depressions and muskegs."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Klawasi soils are poorly or very poorly drained; runoff is very slow; permeability is moderate above the impermeable permafrost.  The profile typically is saturated with water below the A horizon, but free water often occurs within the organic surface horizon in depressional areas.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is destroyed by fire or clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level with subsequent lowering of the water table."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Klawasi soils are in native vegetation of white spruce, black spruce, and willows.  The successional state of the vegetation in a given area is closely related to the fire history.  This soil is used primarily for wildlife habitat.  Small areas are cleared and farmed."
