  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kogish series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed from decomposing organic material derived mainly from sphagnum moss.  Kogish soils are in muskegs on nearly level terrace and bench-like landforms along valley floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches, and mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.",

There are up to 15 percent woody fragments.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 42 degrees F. Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.  The soils are never frozen below a depth of 2 inches in most years due to maritime influence.  pH is extremely acid throughout the control section.\nThe organic layers have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value moist from 2 through 7, and chroma moist from 2 through 6."

Kaikli and Maybeso soils are forested muskegs; Kaikli overlies bedrock, Maybeso overlies glacial till.  Karta and Wadleigh soils are mineral soils developed in till on hillslopes and drumlinoid areas.  Kina soils are in open muskegs, dominated by hemic material, and are underlain by mineral material or bedrock at depths greater than 51 inches.  St. Nicholas and Tolstoi are shallow, mineral soils overlying bedrock on hillslopes."
