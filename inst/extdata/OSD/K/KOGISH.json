    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  More than three fourths of the organic material in the surface layers is composed of sphagnum moss.  These layers range from 36 to 50 inches thick.  There are up to 15 percent woody fragments.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 42 degrees F. Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.  The soils are never frozen below a depth of 2 inches in most years due to maritime influence.  pH is extremely acid throughout the control section.\nThe organic layers have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value moist from 2 through 7, and chroma moist from 2 through 6."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kogish soils occur in open muskegs on terraces and bench-like landforms of valley floors.  They formed in organic material derived mainly from sphagnum moss.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of 60 to 220 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 900 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kaikli, Karta, Kina, Maybeso, St. Nicholas, Tolstoi, and Wadleigh series.  Kaikli and Maybeso soils are forested muskegs; Kaikli overlies bedrock, Maybeso overlies glacial till.  Karta and Wadleigh soils are mineral soils developed in till on hillslopes and drumlinoid areas.  Kina soils are in open muskegs, dominated by hemic material, and are underlain by mineral material or bedrock at depths greater than 51 inches.  St. Nicholas and Tolstoi are shallow, mineral soils overlying bedrock on hillslopes."
