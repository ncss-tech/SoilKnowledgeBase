  "REVDATE": "04/2011",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kniffin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on summits of interfluves, side slopes, and treads on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.",
