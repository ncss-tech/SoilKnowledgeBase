  "OVERVIEW": "The Kountze series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These nearly level soils formed in fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid-Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).",
