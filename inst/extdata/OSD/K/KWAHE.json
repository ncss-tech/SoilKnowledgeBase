  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kwahe series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in eolian materials over alluvial deposits derived from shale. Kwahe soils are on playa steps that receive an additional 1 to 2 inches of moisture from run-on in some years. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
