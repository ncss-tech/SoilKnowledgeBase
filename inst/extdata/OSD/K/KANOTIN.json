  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanotin series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying clayey lacustrine sediments on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (one foot) above the surface to 30 cm (one foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. The soil is saturated for a period of 90 to 120 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy material and moderately low in the underlying clayey sediments. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy material and slow in the underlying clayey sediments."
