  "OVERVIEW": "The Kataka series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and granitic rocks. Kataka soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 10 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
