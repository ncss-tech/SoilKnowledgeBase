    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness is 30 to 55 inches.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid throughout except for the surface layer in limed areas.  Fine flakes of mica are few to common throughout.  The control section has an average clay content of 35 to 50 percent and an average silt content of 15 to 35 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe BA or BE horizons, where present, have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6, or hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 8.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR value of 4 or 5 chroma of 6 or 8.  Few to common mottles in shades of brown and yellow are in the Bt horizon of some pedons.  Texture is clay, clay loam, sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6, or hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Few to common mottles in shades of brown or yellow are in some pedons.  This horizon is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, and below 40 inches is loamy sand or sand.  Some pedons have subhorizons stratified with the contrasting textures."

Appling, Cataula, Cecil, Chestatee, Georgeville, Herndon, Hulett, Madison, Pacolet, Spotsylvania, and Wedowee soils are on uplands of the Southern Piedmont; they are underlain by residuum, saprolite, or crystalline rock.  Aragon soils have chert fragments throughout.  Chestatee soils also have more than 15 percent by volume coarse fragments throughout.  Nankin soils are on the uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain.  Nectar soils are underlain by sandstone bedrock 40 to 60 inches below the surface.  Neeses soils are dense and slightly cemented in the lower part of the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kolomoki soils are on convex parts of stream terraces of the larger streams of the Southern Coastal Plain. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range up to 5 percent. The soil formed in clayey and sandy alluvial sediment that contains an appreciable amount of silt.  Mean annual precipitation is about 45 to 55 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 to 70 degrees F.  Under abnormal conditions the lower lying areas may be flooded  for very brief periods."

Hornsville, Eulonia, Eunola, and Johns soils have chroma 2 mottles at depths less than 24 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  Leaf, Myatt, Rembert, Trebloc, and Weston soils are dominantly gray immediately below the A horizon and are on lower lying areas.  Wahee soils are dominantly gray at depths less than 30 inches below the surface."
