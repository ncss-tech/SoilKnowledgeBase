  "OVERVIEW": "The Kayak series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. It is on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about about 49 degrees F.",
