  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaiparowits series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from dolomitic limestone, sandstone, and chert. Kaiparowits soils are on summits and sideslopes of low hills and ridges on plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
