  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to 100 inches or more.  The profile contains 2 to 15 percent by volume of rock fragments, most of which are igneous rocks.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  The A and E horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand with the coarser textures commonly in the E horizon.  They are slightly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have 10YR hue in the upper part, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It mostly is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam, but thin sandy clay loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand subhorizons are in some pedons.  It typically averages between 10 to 15 percent clay but ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  It ranges from 55 to 70 percent fine sand and coarser material.  B/A clay ratios are 1.5 to 2.0.  It commonly is strongly or moderately acid and less commonly slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part of some pedons.  Some pedons have a thin BC horizon.\nThe C horizon typically has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4, but thin strata with yellower hues are common. It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam but thin, finer- or coarser-textured strata are common.  It is friable or firm.  It is moderately acid through slightly alkaline.  It has less than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Backbone, Bainter(T), Desker, Forkhorn(T), Billett, Oronoco, Pardeeville, Rusktown(T) and Ulster series.  Backbone soils have bedrock beginning at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Bainter(T), Desker, Forkhorn(T) and Rusktown(T) soils have sandy textures in the lower third of the series control section. Billett soils have formed in outwash and have loamy sand or sand C horizons.  Oronoco soils formed in aeolian sediments and lack coarse fragments.  Ulster soils have a lithologic discontinuity and stratified textures(eolian) in the lower third of the series control section.  Pardeeville soils are not clearly separated at this time.  Will need further study."

The Kingsley soils formed in nonacid, reddish brown sandy loam till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 130 to 160.  Elevations above sea level range from 1000 to 1300 feet."
