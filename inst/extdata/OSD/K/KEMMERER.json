    "section": "TYPE LOCATION",
    "content": "TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Wyoming; 325 feet east and 2640 feet south of the northwest corner of section 34, T12N, R116W.\nTypically these soils are calcareous throughout but may be leached as deep as 10 inches in some pedons. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to visible accumulations of calcium carbonate ranges from 10 to 25 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F. Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent throughout and are dominantly gravel size. The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 15 to 45 percent sand with 15 to 35 percent being fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR,  value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and  chroma of 2 through 4. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and  chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is mildly through strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent typically ranges from 4 to about 14 percent."
