  "OVERVIEW": "The Keawakapu series consists of well drained extremely stony soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash overlying basalt.  Keawakapu soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 76 degrees F.",
