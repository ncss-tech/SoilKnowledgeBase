  "OVERVIEW": "The Kulshan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone and metasedimentary rocks.  Kulshan soils are on glacially modified backslopes and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
