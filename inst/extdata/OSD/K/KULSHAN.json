  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kulshan soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes and ridges at elevations of 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 80 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone and metasedimentary rocks.  Kulshan soils are in a cold marine climate with cool dry summers and cold wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from late October through early June.  Mean annual precipitation is 90 to 110 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 95 days."

This draft reflects a change in classification from medial Humic Cryorthods to coarse-loamy, mixed Humic Cryorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 2 inches, a spodic horizon from 2 to 14 inches with 8.50 to 9.25 percent organic carbon in the upper 11 inches, and a lithic contact at 30 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
