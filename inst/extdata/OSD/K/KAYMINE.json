    "content": "REMARKS: (1) These soils were formerly mapped as strip mines; Udorthents, mudstone and sandstone, high base; Udorthents, sandstone and mudstone, high base. (2) Mineralogy data from West Virginia University indicates that the Kaymine soils have mixed mineralogy. (3) Lithochromic mottles have inherited their colors from rocks. (4) Under the West Virginia University proposed classification, these soils would have been classified Typic Udispolents. (5) The 8/00 revision updates this series to 8th edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy standards. The CEC activity class placement is based on four pedons sampled and analyzed by West Virginia University, which included two semiactive, one active and one superactive pedons. Competing series were also updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13cm (00 to 05 inches) (Ap horizon)\nThe percentage of any one rock type is less than 65 percent of the total rock fragments in the particle-size control section (12 to 42 inches; C1, C2 horizons).\n2014 edit updates.semitab formatting\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nAdditional data is available from West Virginia University (minimum of four pedons). Mineralogy data from West Virginia University indicates that Kaymine soils have mixed mineralogy.\nRevised: 2/88-JWB,BLW,LDS; 8/2000-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
