  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Kian soils were formerly included in the Bibb series. The original series description was erroneously located in an area not indicative of the series. The location was changed to this pedon during the update of MLRA 152B. This site represents the series concept well. The classification was changed during the update of MLRA 152B to reflect current taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features of this soil are:\nOchric epipedon -0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in) (A horizons)\nCambic horizon- 8 to 203 cm (3 to 80 in) (Bw and Bg horizons)\nAquic conditions-41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in)( Bw2 and Bg horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:   Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on the series type location. Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data available on pedon S12TX373024 from the typical pedon in Polk County, Texas.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
