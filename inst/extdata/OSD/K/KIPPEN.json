  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 40 inches thick.  Kippen soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches, but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation typically is more than 80 percent and ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  The control section is loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.  A high percentage of the sand fraction is angular and has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter.  The solum and C horizons range from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon normally has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons."

Ouray soils have a moderately coarse textured layer 10 to 25 inches thick in the upper part of the control section and have only small amounts of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular granite sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kippen soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 30 or more percent.  The soils formed in thick deposits of coarse textured material derived from arkose beds or granite.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer."
