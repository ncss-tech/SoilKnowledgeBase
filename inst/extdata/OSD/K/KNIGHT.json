Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 9.4 to 14.4 degrees C (49 to 58 degrees F), and annual precipitation ranges from about 610 to 1295 mm (24 to 51 inches) near the type location."

Permeability is moderately slow or moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderate to moderately rapid  in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. In normal years, the apparent seasonal high water table is at the surface to 31 cm (1 foot) below the surface in spring. Ponding depth is generally less than 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface. A rarely flooded phase has is recognized."
