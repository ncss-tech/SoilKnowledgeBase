  "OVERVIEW": "The Knight series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils. Knight soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces and flood plain steps. Knight soils formed in loess or silty material and are underlain by loamy or coarser textured outwash. Slope is usually less than 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches) near the type location.",
