  "OVERVIEW": "The Keatchie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping uplands. Slopes are dominantly less than 5 percent but range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in).",
