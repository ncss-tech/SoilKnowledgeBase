The Keithville and Metcalf soils have fine-silty sediments over a clayey discontinuity and the Latex and Scottsville soils have fine-loamy sediments over a clayey discontinuity.  Eastwood and Meth soils have red clayey Bt horizons.  Eastwood soils are found on gently sloping ridges and moderately steep side slopes along drainage ways.  Meth soils are found on slightly higher convex ridge tops.  Frierson soils are found on slightly convex ridge tops and have red loamy Bt horizons.  Timpson soils are found on slightly lower mounded landscapes."
