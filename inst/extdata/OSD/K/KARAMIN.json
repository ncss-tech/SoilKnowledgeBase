Orwig soils are similar and need review for adequate separation, they have developed in mixed volcanic ash over outwash derived from granitic material and the sands are angular and granitic.  Packerjohn soils have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have an umbric epipedon."

The soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash over glacial outwash. Elevations are 2,700 to 4,500 feet. The climate is characterized by with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Gahee and Manley soils have have a mantle of volcanic ash over 14 inches thick and are cryic.  Goddard and Kiehl soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick and are sandy-skeletal.  Merkel soils are loamy-skeletal and moderately deep to a densic contact.  Scrabblers soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick.  Stapaloop soils are coarse-loamy.  Torboy soils are very similar but have a base saturation of over 60 percent in some part between 10 and 30 inches."
