  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Karamin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash over glacial outwash. The Karamin soils are on terraces, terrace escarpments, and toeslopes and footslopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",
