The soils formed eolian deposits derived from volcanic rock and tephra over residuum derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The average annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
