  "OVERVIEW": "The Kamie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from predominantly loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on high terraces mainly in the Ouachita Mountains, Cherokee Prairies, and Boston Mountains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

Attoyac, Calendonia, Elrose, and Petal soils are siliceous and have an average temperature regime of 18 degrees C (64 degrees F) or more.  Atwood and Lexington soils are fine-silty.  Karma, Konawa, and Poindexter soils have an argillic horizon that decreases in clay by more than 20 percent from the maximum at a depth of 1.5 meters.  Also, Konawa soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Macon soils have an average temperature regime of 18 degrees C (64 degrees F) or more.  Sallisaw soils are siliceous and contain gravel in the argillic horizon."
