Attoyac, Calendonia, Elrose, and Petal soils are siliceous and have an average temperature regime of 18 degrees C (64 degrees F) or more.  Atwood and Lexington soils are fine-silty.  Karma, Konawa, and Poindexter soils have an argillic horizon that decreases in clay by more than 20 percent from the maximum at a depth of 1.5 meters.  Also, Konawa soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Macon soils have an average temperature regime of 18 degrees C (64 degrees F) or more.  Sallisaw soils are siliceous and contain gravel in the argillic horizon."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 mm to 1168 mm (37 to 46 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F).

Glenpool and Larton soils are usually on slightly lower terraces and have a thicker A horizon.  Karma soils are on lower terraces.  Muskogee, Okay, and Vian soils are on nearby landscapes.  Muskogee and Vian soils are fine-silty and have gray mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Okay soils have a mollic epipedon.  Sallisaw soils are on lower terraces of local streams."
