  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Moshannon, Nolin, and Ray series in the same family.  Soils in closely related families include Chargin, Cuba, Genesee, Haymond, Huntington, Lindside, Rahm, Steff, Wilbur, and Woodmere series.  Moshannon soils have B horizons with hues redder than 7.5YR.  Nolin soils have a water table below 6 feet and lack low chroma colors above 72 inches.  Ray soils have a sola less than 40 inches thick and have evidence of stratification above 40 inches.  Chargin and Genesee soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the control section.  Cuba and Steff soils have base saturation of less than 60 percent between the depths of 10 and 30 inches below the soil surface.  Haymond and Wilbur soils have less than 18 percent clay in the textural control section.  Huntington soils have a mollic epipedon.  Lindside and Rahm soils have low chroma mottles within a depth of 24 inches.  Woodmere soils have more than 35 percent clay in the textural control section.\nNote:  These are the competing series per the 6th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (or earlier).  Competing series have not been revised to 7th Edition of Keys."
