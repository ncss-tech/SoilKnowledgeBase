Stones and cobbles range from 5 to 15 percent.  Gravel range from 30 to 45 percent.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7.5YR 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3 or 7.5YR 4/4."

Elevations are 4100 to 4800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 to 12 inches.  Snowfall is 15 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 28 to 31 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 64 to 66 degrees F.
