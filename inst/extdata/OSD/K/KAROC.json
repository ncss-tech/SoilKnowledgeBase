Stones and cobbles range from 5 to 15 percent.  Gravel range from 30 to 45 percent.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7.5YR 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3 or 7.5YR 4/4."
