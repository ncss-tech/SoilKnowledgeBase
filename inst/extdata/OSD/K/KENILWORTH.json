  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenilworth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or in eolian and alluvial deposits over till, or over glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  The Kenilworth soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
