  "OVERVIEW": "The Kestner series consists of moderately deep to dense till, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from alpine glacial till derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on glacial valleys. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 150 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
