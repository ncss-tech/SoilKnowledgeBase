The soils are formed in residuum and colluvium from alpine glacial till derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. Elevations are 800 to 2500 feet. Average annual precipitation is 130 to 170 inches. Fog drip contributes to the effective precipitation totals. Average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.
