  "OVERVIEW": "The Kronquist series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Kronquist soils are in drainageways, flood plains and basins, and around perimeters of lakes. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

They formed in mixed alluvium, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are in a continental climate having dry summers and cool, most winters. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.

Green bluff soils are frigid, coarse-loamy and are on backslopes of foothills. Hoodoo soils are poorly drained, ashy, and are in drainageways and bottomlands. Kramerhill soils are fine-loamy, mesic and are on convex footslopes and backslopes of mountains and foothills. Spokane soils have a mollic epipedon, are coarse-loamy, mesic, and are on west and south-facing convex backslopes of hills."

Areas of Konner mapped in Stevens County will need further investigation as to their drainage class and soil temperature regime.\nKronquist soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed)"
