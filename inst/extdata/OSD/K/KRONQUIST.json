    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kronquist soils are in drainageways, basins and flood plains, and on the perimeters of lakes at elevations of 1,600 to 2,400 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. They formed in mixed alluvium, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are in a continental climate having dry summers and cool, most winters. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Green Bluff, Hoodoo, Kramerhill, Kruse, and Spokane soils. All of these soils except Hoodoo do not have an aquic moisture regime. Green bluff soils are frigid, coarse-loamy and are on backslopes of foothills. Hoodoo soils are poorly drained, ashy, and are in drainageways and bottomlands. Kramerhill soils are fine-loamy, mesic and are on convex footslopes and backslopes of mountains and foothills. Spokane soils have a mollic epipedon, are coarse-loamy, mesic, and are on west and south-facing convex backslopes of hills."

Areas of Konner mapped in Stevens County will need further investigation as to their drainage class and soil temperature regime.\nKronquist soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
