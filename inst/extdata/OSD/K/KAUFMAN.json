  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaufman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from mudstone.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains on river valleys and dissected plains. Slopes are typically less than 1 percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1193.8 mm (47 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
