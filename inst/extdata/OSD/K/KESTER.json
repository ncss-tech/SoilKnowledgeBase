  "OVERVIEW": "The Kester series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over basalt. They are in drainageways on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees. These soils are usually dry in all parts of the moisture control section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass content, including 10 to 30 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser, 0 to 5 percent pebbles, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 3 to 10 percent. Depth to basalt and thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is ashy sandy loam or ashy fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

The DelRio, Chelan, Dryhollow, Emagert, Weezweed and Yellowhills soils are over 40 inches deep. Bitner soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Brays soils are over granite and average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Deskamp soils lack a cambic horizon. Winblow soils are neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kester soils are in and along intermittent stream bottoms and in drainageways on hill slopes and toe slopes of uplands. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed loess, volcanic ash and pumice over basalt at elevations of 1,800 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. These soils occur in lower positions on the landscape and receive runoff from surrounding landscapes. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

Corbaley soils are found on similar landscape positions as Kester but are ashy-skeletal and shallow to a lithic contact. Renslow soils are on uplands and are very deep and deep."
