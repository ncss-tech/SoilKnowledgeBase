In some pedons the E horizon has been mixed with the A horizon as a result of tillage.\nThe B portion of the B/E horizon has color and texture ranges like the Bt horizon and the E portion is like the E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or clay.  It has moderate or strong prismatic structure and moderate or strong angular blocky structure.  It is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.

The soils formed in fine-loamy glacial till under forest vegetation. The climate is subhumid with warm summers and long cold winters. The mean annual air temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 16 to 26 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer. Frost-free period ranges from 100 to 120 days and elevation ranges from 1150 feet (350 meters) to 2525 feet (770 meters)."

Bottineau soils have a mollic epipedon, less than 35 percent clay in the control section, and do not have an E horizon. Metigoshe soils have more and sand and less clay in the control section and have underlying layers of sand and gravel. They are on nearby collapsed outwash plains. Rolla soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments on nearby collapsed lake plains. Eramosh soils are in fens and are ponded during part of the growing season."
