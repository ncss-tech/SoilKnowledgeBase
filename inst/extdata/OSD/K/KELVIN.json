  "OVERVIEW": "The Kelvin series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly and slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial till.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 25 percent.  The mean air annual temperature is about 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

The mean annual air temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 16 to 26 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer. Frost-free period ranges from 100 to 120 days and elevation ranges from 1150 feet (350 meters) to 2525 feet (770 meters)."

Bottineau soils have a mollic epipedon, less than 35 percent clay in the control section, and do not have an E horizon. Metigoshe soils have more and sand and less clay in the control section and have underlying layers of sand and gravel. They are on nearby collapsed outwash plains. Rolla soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments on nearby collapsed lake plains. Eramosh soils are in fens and are ponded during part of the growing season."
