  "OVERVIEW": "The Kendallville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying outwash and loamy till. These soils are on moraines, kames, eskers, and outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

    "content": "REMARKS: Lab data for the type location (CH-41) shows that the particle-size class is fine textured. This series needs to be reevaluated under the MLRA concept and a new type location established. Also the color of the clay films were not in the original description of the 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons so it was considered the same color as the matrix color. Roots were also not described but were entered in the Ap and Bt horizons because of the type of the vegetation in the field.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 18 to 76 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons)."
