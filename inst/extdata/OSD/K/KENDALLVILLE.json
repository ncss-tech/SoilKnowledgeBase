  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kendallville soils are on moraines, kames, eskers, and outwash terraces of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying outwash and loamy till. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days. Elevation is 192 to 373 meters (630 to 1225 feet) above mean sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Lab data for the type location (CH-41) shows that the particle-size class is fine textured. This series needs to be reevaluated under the MLRA concept and a new type location established. Also the color of the clay films were not in the original description of the 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons so it was considered the same color as the matrix color. Roots were also not described but were entered in the Ap and Bt horizons because of the type of the vegetation in the field.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 18 to 76 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedons FR-51, PY-24, PY-26, and CH-41 (the type location) for available laboratory characterization data from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
