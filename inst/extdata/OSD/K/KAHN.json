  "OVERVIEW": "The Kahn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium.  Kahn soils are on alluvial fans and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
