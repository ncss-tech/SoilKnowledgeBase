  "OVERVIEW": "The Kawuneeche series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over glaciofluvial deposits derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Kawuneeche soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

(Bg and Cg1 horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions:  In the zone from 12 to 66 inches. (Bg, Cg1, and 2Cg2 horizons)\nEndosaturation:  The zone of saturation at 0 to 66 inches. (Oe, Bg, Cg1, and 2Cg2 horizons) for some time in most years.\nLithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2Cg2 horizon.\nRemarks:  This soil was previously classified as a Typic Cryaquoll.  Laboratory results established low base saturation and an umbric epipedon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S97CO-049-001.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon has data from the NSSL; pedon number S97CO-049-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
