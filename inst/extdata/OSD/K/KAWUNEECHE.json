(Bg and Cg1 horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions:  In the zone from 12 to 66 inches. (Bg, Cg1, and 2Cg2 horizons)\nEndosaturation:  The zone of saturation at 0 to 66 inches. (Oe, Bg, Cg1, and 2Cg2 horizons) for some time in most years.\nLithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2Cg2 horizon.\nRemarks:  This soil was previously classified as a Typic Cryaquoll.  Laboratory results established low base saturation and an umbric epipedon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S97CO-049-001.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon has data from the NSSL; pedon number S97CO-049-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
