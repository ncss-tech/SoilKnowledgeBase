The original concept of the series was in the fine textural family.  The lab data for the type location (90KS155008) was 34% carbonate free clay on a weighted average and 36% clay total weighted average.  In addition, there are several horizons with greater than 40% clay total.  Based on this information we are updating the classification and competing series.  The 8 inches of mollic colors is more than 1/3 of the depth to pedogenic carbonates and qualifies as thick enough for a mollic epipedon.\nhttp://ssldata.nrcs.usda.gov/rptExecute.asp?p=17242&r=1&r=4&submit1=Get+Report\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
