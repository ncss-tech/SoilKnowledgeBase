    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean summer soil temperature is about 47 degrees F. and the mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Due to the maritime influence, the soils are not frozen below a depth of 2 inches in most years.  Depth to gravelly muck ranges from 7 to 18 inches.  Gravel content increases with depth.  There is more than 12 percent organic carbon is all layers.  pH is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Oa2 horizon has from 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 0a3 horizon has from 60 to 80 percent coarse fragments; gravel content ranges from 60 to 80 percent, and cobble content ranges from 0 to 20 percent."

Maybeso soils have mineral soil material with less than 12 percent organic carbon in the control section.  Kaikli and Sunnyhay soils are moderately deep over bedrock.  Kitkun soils are shallow over bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Karheen soils occur on low gently sloping to moderately sloping uplifted beaches adjacent to tidal water.  The parent material is decomposing organic material which overlies, and is intermixed with, beach gravel and cobbles of mixed rock type.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation in excess of 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F and the mean summer air temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 200 feet."

The overstory is dominantly western hemlock and western redcedar with lesser amounts of Sitka spruce.  The understory vegetation consists largely of blueberry, red huckleberry, rusty menziesia, skunk cabbage, forbs, ferns, and moss."
