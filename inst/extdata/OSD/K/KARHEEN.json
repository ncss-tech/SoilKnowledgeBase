  "OVERVIEW": "The Karheen series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed from decomposing organic material which is underlain, and intermixed, with beach deposits.  Karheen soils occur on uplifted beaches adjacent to tidal water.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation exceeds 100 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean summer soil temperature is about 47 degrees F. and the mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Due to the maritime influence, the soils are not frozen below a depth of 2 inches in most years.  Depth to gravelly muck ranges from 7 to 18 inches.  Gravel content increases with depth.  There is more than 12 percent organic carbon is all layers.  pH is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Oa2 horizon has from 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 0a3 horizon has from 60 to 80 percent coarse fragments; gravel content ranges from 60 to 80 percent, and cobble content ranges from 0 to 20 percent."

The parent material is decomposing organic material which overlies, and is intermixed with, beach gravel and cobbles of mixed rock type.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation in excess of 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F and the mean summer air temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 200 feet."

The understory vegetation consists largely of blueberry, red huckleberry, rusty menziesia, skunk cabbage, forbs, ferns, and moss."
