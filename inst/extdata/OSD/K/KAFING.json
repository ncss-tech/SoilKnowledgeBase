The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice. The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 40 percent sand in the fine earth fraction. The upper 8 to 14 inches has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent and Alox plus  Feox of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.\nThe A horizon is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe AB horizon or BA horizon (when present), has a chroma of 3 or 4 moist. It is ashy loam or ashy clay loam and averages 0 to 5 percent hard sandstone gravel and 20 to 30 percent soft sandstone and siltstone paragravel. It has a moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter. It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 4 or 5 moist. It is clay loam or silty clay loam and averages 0 to 5 percent sandstone gravel, 15 to 20 percent soft sandstone and siltstone paragravel, and 0 to 20 percent soft sandstone and siltstone paracobbles.\nThe BC and C horizons have a value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist. It is silty clay loam or clay loam and averages 0 to 10 percent hard sandstone gravel, 20 to 40 percent soft siltstone or sandstone paragravel, and 10 to 40 percent soft siltstone or sandstone paracobbles."

They formed in colluvium and residuum from siltstone, sandstone with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations are 2,800 to 4,900 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with warm dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 170 days."
