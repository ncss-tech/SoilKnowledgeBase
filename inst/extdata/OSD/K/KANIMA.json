  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanima series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in a regolith from surface coal mining operations and weathered from sandstone, shale, and limestone of the Pennsylvanian age. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16.1 degrees C. (61 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 1143 mm (45 inches).",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kanima soils are on gently sloping valleys and very steep hills or ridges that were formed as the result of surface coal mining operations.  The long narrow hills or ridges are 20 to 100 feet higher than the narrow valleys.  Slopes ranges from 1 to 70 percent. They formed in excavated loamy material weathered from sandstone, shale, and limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 483 to 1372 mm (19 to 54 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 12.2 to 17.8 degrees C. (54 degrees to 64 degrees F).  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64.  Elevation is 198.1 to 320 m (500 to 1050 feet).
