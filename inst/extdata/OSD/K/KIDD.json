  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches (25 to 51 cm). The mean annual soil temperature is 55 degrees to 59 degrees F, and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The soil to bedrock is dry in all parts from about June 5 until October 15 and is moist in all parts from December through April 30.  Rock fragments, mostly 1/2 to 3 inches in size, makeup about 10 to 35 percent of the soil.  Rock fragments commonly increase as depth increases and exceed 35 percent in the lower part of the Bw horizon in some pedons.  They average less than 35 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon is 10YR with value of 4 through 8 dry, 3, 4, or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry, and 1, 2, or 3 moist.  Some pedons are 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/4 moist.  It is gravelly loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam and has weak or moderate granular or crumb structure.  It is slightly or medium acid.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR or 7.5YR hue with value of 4 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist and chromas of 1, 2, 3 or 4 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is sandy loam, clay loam, gravelly loam or loam and has granular or crumb structure or is massive. It is slightly through strongly acid."

Elevations are 500 to 4,300 feet.  The climate is subhumid with warm to hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is 40 degrees F; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; and mean annual temperature varies from 50 degrees to 56 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 145 to 260 days."

Boomer, Cohasset, Henneke, and Los Gatos soils have argillic horizons and lack medial control sections.  Goulding soils lack medial control sections and have frigid temperature regimes.  Hambright soils have mollic epipedons, loamy-skeletal control sections, and thermic temperature regimes.  Neuns soils have bulk density of 1 or more and have loamy-skeletal control sections."

Soils with depths less than 10 inches would exclude cambic horizons.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.  Mineralogy family added 3/97.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nSeries reclassified on 5/2018 with insufficient lab data and the assumption that soils in the Sonoma volcanics lack ASP. - AEC\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedon S72CA-055-001 (type location). Andic soil porperties were not run on the type location samples.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
