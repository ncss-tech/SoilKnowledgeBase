  "OVERVIEW": "The Knapke series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered dominantly from olivine gabbro, but may include gabbro and metagabbro rock types.  Knapke soils are on footslopes and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 80 consecutive days in the 4 months that follow the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 45 to 85 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 15 percent are cobbles and stones.  Rock fragments are dominantly olivine gabbro, but may include gabbro and metagabbro rock types.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist.
