These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 80 consecutive days in the 4 months that follow the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 45 to 85 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 15 percent are cobbles and stones.  Rock fragments are dominantly olivine gabbro, but may include gabbro and metagabbro rock types.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist.  It averages 45 to 85 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 20 percent are cobbles and stones.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 35 to 70 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered dominantly from olivine gabbro, but include gabbro and metagabbro rock types.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual temperature is 46 to 56 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 50 to 70 inches but may range to 100 inches in the interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The frost free period is 100 to 200 days."
