  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 40 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils have intervening C horizons in some pedons where bedrock is deep, and have thin dark colored A1 horizons in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent and are mostly sandstone fragments more than 10 inches in diameter.  Reaction ranges from pH 4.5 to 5.5.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1.5 through 3.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.  This horizon tongues into the B2t horizon.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Dry consistence is hard or slightly hard.  The fine earth fraction is typically sandy loam and has 10 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand."

All except Agneston, Cloud Peak, Hyattville, Lake Creek, Lakehelen and Lulude soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Agneston, Cloud Peak, Hyattville, Lake Creek and Lulude soils have more than 18 percent clay in their control section.  Lakehelen soils have hue of 5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kebler soils are on mountain side slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured strongly acid parent materials weathered from underlying sandstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with generally uniform distribution occurring throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature is about 32 to 36 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 40 days."

Sawcreek soils have mollic epipedons.   Tongue River soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section."
