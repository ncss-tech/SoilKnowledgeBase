  "OVERVIEW": "The Killarney series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with fragipans on foot slopes in mountainous areas. They formed in slope alluvium mixed with loess and the underlying slope alluvium or residuum derived from rhyolite or granite rocks.  Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

The shape of the surface up and down slope commonly is concave.  Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent. They formed in slope alluvium mixed with loess and the underlying slope alluvium or residuum derived from rhyolite or granite rocks. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Delassus soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments and commonly are on less sloping positions.  Frenchmill soils do not have a fragipan and are on similar landscape positions as Killarney soils. Irondale, Knobtop, and Syenite soils are 20 to 40 inches over bedrock and commonly are on mountainous slopes at higher elevations.  Loughboro soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, are poorly drained and are on nearly level uplands.  Midco soils do not have a fragipan and are on flood plains lower in the landscape."
