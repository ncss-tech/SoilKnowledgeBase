The surface gradient ranges from less than 1 percent to about 8 percent.  The climate is semiarid to arid with average annual precipitation of 14 to 20 inches which occurs in the late spring and summer months.  Elevation is 4,000 to 5,000 feet.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices range from about 14 to 30.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F."
