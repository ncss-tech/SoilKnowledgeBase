    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 59 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry less than 45 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  Organic matter is 5 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klooqueh soils are on marine terraces. The soils formed in marine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 40 to 200 feet.  The climate is  humid characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers, with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperatures.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 270 to 330 days.  Klooqueh soils are on the Pioneer geomorphic surface."

Huffling soils are poorly drained and have redox depletions in the surface horizons.  Crofland soils are somewhat poorly drained and have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 20 to 30 inches."
