  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of partially decomposed moss and roots 3 to 7 inches thick.  Thickness of the silty loess mantle over sand ranges from 8 to 18 but is dominantly less than 10 inches.  Depth to the permafrost ranges from 10 to 25 inches below the soil surface.  The weighted average particle size of the control section is fine or medium sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid in the organic mat to slightly acid in the lower horizons.\nThe A horizon has value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist from 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam, mucky silt loam, fine sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value is 4 or 5; and chroma ranges from 2 to 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe 2C and 2Cf horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; and value moist from 3 to 6.   Texture is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kindanina soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess which overlies eolian sand.  The soils are in depressions on stabilized dunes and adjacent large alluvial plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe climate is continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches, and includes the mean annual snowfall of about 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 24 to 28 degrees F."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is ponded to medium.   Permeability is moderate in the loess mantle, rapid in the sand layers above the permafrost, and impermeable below.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic layer is destroyed by fire or mechanical clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level with possible subsequent lowering of the water table."
