  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenn series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These level to gently sloping soils are on flood plains of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 1168 cm (46 in).",
