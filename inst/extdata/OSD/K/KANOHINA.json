  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kanohina soils are on south slopes on the Mauna Loa undissected upland and in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park at elevations from sea level to 305 meters (0 to 1,000 feet). These soils are in depressions of constructional landscapes and on nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe flows that are 750 to 1,500 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges from 22 to 24 degrees C (72 to 75 degrees F)."
