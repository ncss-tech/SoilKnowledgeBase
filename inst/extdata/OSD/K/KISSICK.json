  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Kissick soils have cracks at the ground surface as wide as 1 1/2 inches around coarse prisms. These cracks taper to a close in the dry soil at depths greater than 20 inches. These cracks remain open for less than 60 consecutive days after mid or late July and close with September rains. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is about 60 degrees F. Clay in A, Bss and BCss horizons ranges from 45 to 60 percent and gradually decreases with depth to as low as 30 percent within a depth of 40 inches. The moist A horizon has hues of 10YR to 2.5Y, values of 2 to 3 and chroma of less than 1.5. Tongues of A horizon extending through the Bss and into the BCss horizon are as thick as 1 inch surrounding prisms in the upper Bss horizon and taper to less than 1/8 inch thick surrounding prisms in the lower Bss horizon, and they taper to pendants in the upper C horizons. A and Bss horizons are noncalcareous. Depth to calcareous soil ranges from 15 to 24 inches.\nHues of the Bss horizon range from 10YR to 2.5Y, values from 5 to 6 in dry soil and 3 to 4 in moist soil, with chroma of 3 or 2. Tongues and coatings of soil from A horizon range from few to many.\nColor of C horizons ranges from 10YR to 5Y hues, with values of 5 to 6 dry, 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 4. Soil from A1 horizon occurs as few to common very thin coatings on widely spaced vertical cracks at depths ranging from 25 to 35 inches where few to common distinct soft segregations of lime occur. Contrasting strata of siltstone, sandstone or clay shale may occur below depths of 40 inches."
