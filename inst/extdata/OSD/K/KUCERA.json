  "OVERVIEW": "The Kucera series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and silty alluvium from mixed sources. They are on terraces, hills, ridges, basalt plains, and hills. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",

Lanoak soils occur on hills, ridges, fans remnants and mountain slopes, lack a calcic horizons within 109 cm of the mineral soil surface and are fine-silty. Lonjon soils occur on hills and mountain slopes, are calcareous to the surface and are loamy-skeletal. Ririe soils occur on hills, terraces and mountain slopes and have a 18 to 40 cm thick mollic epipedon. Rexburg soils occur on similar landform positions and have a 30 to 50 cm thick mollic epipedon.
