Lanoak soils occur on hills, ridges, fans remnants and mountain slopes, lack a calcic horizons within 109 cm of the mineral soil surface and are fine-silty. Lonjon soils occur on hills and mountain slopes, are calcareous to the surface and are loamy-skeletal. Ririe soils occur on hills, terraces and mountain slopes and have a 18 to 40 cm thick mollic epipedon. Rexburg soils occur on similar landform positions and have a 30 to 50 cm thick mollic epipedon. Sprollow soils occur on ridges, hill slopes and mountain slopes, are calcareous to the surface and are loamy-skeletal."
