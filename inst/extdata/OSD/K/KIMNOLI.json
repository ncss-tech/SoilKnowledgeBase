  "STATES": "AZ,CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kimnoli series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that developed in eolian material, alluvium, and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale on ridges, hills, mesas, and cuestas. Slope is 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
