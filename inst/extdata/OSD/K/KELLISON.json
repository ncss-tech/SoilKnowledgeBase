  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  When dry, the soil has cracks that extend from the surface to a depth of 12 inches or more for 60 to 80 days during most years.  Slickensides begin at a depth of 12 to 24 inches.  The sodium absorption ratio ranges from 2 to 9 in the upper part of the Bt horizon and from 2 to 12 in the lower part.  The SAR commonly increases with depth.  Redox features are relic or lithochromic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or loam.  The combined thickness of the A and E horizons is 3 to 10 inches.  Some pedons do not have an E horizon.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Redox features in shades of red or brown range from few to common.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Btss horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, with value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Masses and/or crystals of gypsum, mainly in the lower part, range from none to commmon.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, with value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 3.  It is shale or shale  interbedded with mudstone with texture of clay loam or clay.  Masses and/or crystals of gypsum range from few to many in most pedons.  The sodium absorption ratio ranges from 2 to 13.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Colbert, Eastwood, Edna, Etoile, Kipling, Lorman, Oula, Rayburn, Wilcox, and Woodtell soils.  Colbert soils are underlain by limestone bedrock.  Eastwood soils have reddish upper Bt horizons, receive more annual rainfall, and have a greater woodland productivity potential.  Edna soils are more alkaline throughout and are mainly on slopes of less than 3 percent.  Etoile soils have colors with hue redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the Bt horizon and they are more alkaline in the C horizon.  Kipling and Oula soils are not underlain by shale or mudstone geologic materials and they receive more than 46 inches of annual rainfall.  Lorman, Wilcox, and Woodtell soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Rayburn soils have a paralithic contact of tuffaceous materials at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kellison soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep uplands.  They are on low ridges and along side slopes above drainageways.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  They formed in shale or shale stratified with mudstone of the Yegua, Caddell or Manning geologic formations.  The elevation is 200 to 390 feet above sea level.  The frost free days range from 230 to 245.  The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F., the average annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 52 inches and the Thornwaite P-E index ranges from 68 to 82."

Etoile and Herty soils are on lower positions in the landscape and are moderately well drained.  Keltys and Kurth soils have loamy control sections and are on similar positions.  Moswell soils have a very-fine control section, and are on similar or slightly lower positions.  Raylake soils have a clay loam surface layer and are on similar or slightly lower positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Kellison soils were formerly included with the Herty series.  The matrix color of this soil is considered lithochromic and the redox features are relic.  It is well drained based on the landscape position, native vegetation, and land uses.  The name Kellison is from a creek in the area.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches, the A and E horizons.\nArgillic horizon - 7 to 47 inches, the Bt and Bss horizons.\nVertic properties - slickensides at a depth of 22 to 47 inches.  In addition the soil cracks when dry.\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD NUMBER: TX1272\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
