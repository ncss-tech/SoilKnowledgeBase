The soils occur on fan remnants, mountain slopes, hills and lake terraces formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from sandstone, quartzite and limestone. The climate is dry subhumid. The average annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm. Mean annual temperature is 7.0 to 11.0 degrees C, and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."

The native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, Great Basin wildrye, bitterbrush, western wheatgrass, and big sagebrush. In Utah this series is correlated with upland range sites."
