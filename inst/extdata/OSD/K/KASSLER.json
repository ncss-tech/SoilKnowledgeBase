  "OVERVIEW": "The Kassler series consists of deep, somewhat excessive to excessively drained soils that formed from arkose deposits.  Permeability is rapid.  Kassler soils are on alluvial fans, valley side slopes, terraces, and bottoms of small narrow drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 40 inches thick.  Kassler soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches, but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation typically is more than 80 percent and ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  The particle-size control section averages very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.  A high percentage of the sand fraction is angular and has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in a major part of the particle-size control section and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The particle-size control section ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R."

Parent materials have come from the arkose deposits of the Arapahoe and Dawson formations.  Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 100 to 125 days."
