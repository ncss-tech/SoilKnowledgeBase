  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Krum series consists of very deep to clayey alluvium, well drained soils that formed in  calcareous clayey alluvium derived from interbedded chalk and marl. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on risers and treads of stream terraces on river valleys and dissected plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 873.8 mm (34.4 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.4 degrees C (68.7 degrees F).",
