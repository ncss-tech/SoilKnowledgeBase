  "OVERVIEW": "The Kulani series consists of deep and very deep, well-drained soils that formed in volcanic ash deposited over cinders. Kulani soils are located on the slopes of Mauna Loa volcano.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent but are typically 3 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 2,032 millimeters (80 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
