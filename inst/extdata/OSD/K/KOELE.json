Mean annual soil temperature is about 21 degrees C. (69 degrees F.). The soil is dry in some horizon for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThickness, texture and consistence of the layers in the C horizon vary considerably within a short distance. The layers may be sand, coarse sandy loam, coarse sandy clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. The contrasting textural layers are 1/2 to more than 12 inches thick."
