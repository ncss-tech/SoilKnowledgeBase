  "OVERVIEW": "The Kilgore series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Kilgore soils are on floodplains, low terraces, and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches.  Thin organic horizons occur on the surface of some pedons.  Depth to the sandy, skeletal substratum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section is silt loam, loam or clay loam, and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section range from 0 to 10 percent and are dominantly of gravel size.  The lower part of the particle size control section has 30 to 45 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobble.  The solum is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  The moisture control section is saturated most of the time, but the surface layer may be less than saturated for short periods during late summer.\nThe A horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist or dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Faint redox concentrations are common.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR."

At the type location, the precipitation is 16 to 25 inches, with major amounts occurring in late fall and winter as snow. The mean annual temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F and the frost-free season is 30 [TWH1]to 90 days."
