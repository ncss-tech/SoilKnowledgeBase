  "OVERVIEW": "The Kiokluk series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess deposits overlying coarse textured glaciofluvial sediments.  Kiokluk soils are on stream terraces, hillslopes and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 40 to over 60 inches.  Texture of the loess mantle is silt loam with less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the loess cap and slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizons have moist hue from 10YR through 2.5Y; value moist from 2 through 4; and chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Occasional thin strata of darker colors (buried O horizons and charcoal) occur throughout these horizons.   Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam with occasional strata of fine sand.\nThe buried B/C horizons have two dominant color groups.  The B portion has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist from 4 through 6.  The C portion has has hue from 10YR through 5Y; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Occasional thin strata of darker colors (buried O horizons and charcoal) occur throughout these horizons.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bwb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist from 4 to 6; Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.  Coarse fragments range from 20 to 45 percent and include rounded gravel and cobble.\nThe 2C horizons have variegated colors.  Textures include sand, coarse sand and loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent include rounded gravel, cobble and few stones."

They formed in a loess mantle overlying glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel.  Kiokluk soils receive an annual increment of fresh loess.  The loess consists of glacial flour from active glacial outwash plains.  The climate is transitional maritime-continental.  Mean annual temperature is 35 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 17 inches."
