Alderon, Bayerton, Belltower, Elmark and Lumpgulch soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Allens Park, Jemco, Jemez, and Shoemaker soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Elbeth soils have an albic horizon and are dry in the winter.  Elbuck soils are slightly acid or more acidic and average more than 45 percent sand. Heflun soils have the base of the argillic horizon at less than  30 inches. Sweetweed soils have a glossic horizon. Haugan soils have secondary calcium carbonate. Plome soils have hues of 10R to 5YR. Rule soils are inactive. In addition Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Belltower, Elbeth, Elbuck, Elmark, Haugan, Hoyt, Jemco, Jemez, Littlepine, Losindios, Lumpgulch, Plome, Rule, and Sweetweed soils are moist in the soil moisture contral section during May and June. Kwaivu and Northrim soils are inadequately competed on soil properties and qualities."

These soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and slope alluvium weathered from sandstone, shale, basalt and limestone. The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. The freeze-free period ranges from 80 to 120 days."
