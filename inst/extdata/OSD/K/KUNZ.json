  "OVERVIEW": "The Kunz series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Kunz soils are on plateaus and mountainsides and have slopes of 8 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Elbeth soils have an albic horizon and are dry in the winter.  Elbuck soils are slightly acid or more acidic and average more than 45 percent sand. Heflun soils have the base of the argillic horizon at less than  30 inches. Sweetweed soils have a glossic horizon. Haugan soils have secondary calcium carbonate. Plome soils have hues of 10R to 5YR. Rule soils are inactive.
