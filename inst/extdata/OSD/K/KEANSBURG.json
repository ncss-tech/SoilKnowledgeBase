(Colors are for moist soil.)\nAp--0 to 10 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sandy loam; few, fine and medium, distinct mottles of reddish brown (5YR 4/4); weak, fine and medium, granular structure; very friable; very strongly acid; abrupt, smooth boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)\nB1g--10 to 15 inches; olive-gray (5Y 4/2) heavy fine sandy loam; common, or many, fine to coarse, prominent mottles of dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) in ped interiors; moderate, medium, subangular blocky structure; friable, sticky and plastic when wet; pores common; most sand grains bridged, some coated; common iron concretions as much as 1 1/2 inches in diameter; 5 percent glauconite; strongly acid; fragual smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)\nB2tg--15 to 30 inches; heavy fine sandy loam that has olive-gray (5Y 4/2) ped exteriors and dark greenish-gray (5GY 4/1) ped interiors; weak, thin, platy structure; partly friable, partly firm, sticky and plastic when wet; some plates weakly to srongly cemented by iron; pores common; sand grains bridged with clay; 10 percent glaucontie; strongly acid; abrupt, smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 inches thick)\nCg--30 to 60 inches; dark greenish-gray (5GY 4/1) sand layers that have many dark glauconite grains and that alternate with dark reddish-brown (2.5YR 2/4) and dark-red (2.5YR 3/6) sandy loam layers; dand layers are single grain and loose; reddish sandy loam layers are massive, friable, and have about 15 percent glauconite; some sandy loam layers are iron cemented."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Glauconite content ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Rust colored streaks, concretions, or crusts of iron cementation are common but not essential.  They range from weakly cemented to indurated and are in discontinuous layers or sheets.  Rounded quartzose pebbles or fragments of iron cemented sandstone are generally lacking but range to 15 percent in places.  The soil is strongly to extremely acid.\nThe Ap and A1 horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 2 or 3 and chromas of 0 through 3.  Mottles are few or common, fine or medium, and reddish-brown through yellowish brown.  They have sandy loam through loam textures.\nThe B hroizons may range from 5Y to 5GY in hue 4-7 in value, and 1-2 in chroma with brownish yellow to dark reddish brown mottles.   The lower part of the B horizons may range to include matrix colors as red as 2.5YR 2/4 with pale brown to greenish gray mottles.  They have sandy loam, heavy fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam as the dominant texture in all pedons but subhorizons range to clay loam, loam or loamy sand in strata.  The lower boundary is marked by a coarser transitional horizon.\nThe C horizons range from hues greener than 5Y to 2.5Y, values of 3-5 and chromas of 1-3.  They are typically loamy sand or sand with thin strata of finer textures in many places.  Successive strata range from traces to 20 percent glauconite."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competitors recognized in the same family.  Bayboro, Colemantown, Fallsington, Rocomoke, Portsmouth, Shrewsbury, and Weeksville are similar soils in related families.  Bayboro and Colemantown have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Fallsington and Shrewsbury have higher chroma matrix colors immediately beneath the Ap or A1.  Pocomoke, Portsmouth, and Weeksville lack glauconite as an essential component mineral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Keansburg soils are level or nearly level soils on broad flats or depressions and on low areas along streams or waterways.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils developed in sandy sediments containing low or moderate amounts of glauconite.  The sediments were eroded from various glauconitic marine formations and redeposited with a mixture of other materials.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation from 40 to 48 inches, and frost free days from 160 to 190."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Shrewsbury and the unmottled Freehold and Collington and the lightly mottled Holmdel and Adelphia.  Other associated soils are Tinton, Pemberton and Colts Neck.  Tinton and Pemberton have sandy surfaces more than 20 inches thcik.  Colts Neck soils are redder than 5YR in the B horizons and are mostly located in sloping uplands."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Drained and cleared areas are used mainly for hay, pasture, soybeans, corn, vegetables and blueberries.  Common trees in woodlots are pin, willow and swamp white oak, sweetgum, and red maple.  The understory includes viburnum, spice bush, high-bush blueberry and other species."
