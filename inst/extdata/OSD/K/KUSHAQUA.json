Depth to the ortstein material ranges from 12 through 50 centimeters from the mineral surface. Redoximorphic features occur within a depth of 50 centimeters and may be masked by ortstein colors.\nThe O horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It consists of slightly through highly decomposed plant material. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have A horizons up to 3 inches thick with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction of the A horizon ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nSome pedons are currently or were previously under cultivation and contain an Ap horizon up to 20 centimeters thick with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.

Reaction of the Ap horizon ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid. The E horizon may be absent in areas previously cultivated or heavily pastured.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The well drained Wolf Pond (T) and Onchiota (T) soils are on slightly higher landform positions and form a drainage sequence with the Kushaqua soils. The very poorly drained Searsport soils are on lower landscape positions. Adams and Colton soils do not contain more than 50 percent ortstein or redoximorphic features and are on higher landscape positions. The organic Burnt Vly soils are in adjacent depressions and drainageways. The Monadnock soils are formed in till and have a higher content of rock fragments."
