  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kushaqua series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy deposits on lake plains and outwash plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately low to moderately high in the ortstein layer, and high to very high throughout the remainder of the pedon. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 millimeters and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The well drained Wolf Pond (T) and Onchiota (T) soils are on slightly higher landform positions and form a drainage sequence with the Kushaqua soils. The very poorly drained Searsport soils are on lower landscape positions. Adams and Colton soils do not contain more than 50 percent ortstein or redoximorphic features and are on higher landscape positions. The organic Burnt Vly soils are in adjacent depressions and drainageways. The Monadnock soils are formed in till and have a higher content of rock fragments."
