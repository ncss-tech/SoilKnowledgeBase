  "OVERVIEW": "The Kazul series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Kazul soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
