  "STATES": "IL,IA,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Keswick series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loess or loamy sediments and in the underlying paleosol weathered from glacial till. These soils are on convex summits of interfluves, convex side slopes, shoulders of side slopes on till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters.",
