  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick, depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 30 inches, the solum ranges from 16 to 40 inches thick, and depth to shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 0.8 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The particle size control section is typically light clay or heavy clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the solum and control section and are chiefly small shale fragments.  Typically, these soils have weak but continuous Ck horizons, but such horizons are thin in places.  The solum ranges from pH 6.8 to 8.0.  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is 48 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Typically, it has granular or crumb structure, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in the lower part of some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Typically, it has moderate subangular or angular blocky structure, but has weak prismatic structure in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR.  It ranges from pH 8.0 to 8.4 and has about 1 to 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  In some pedons, this horizon has a few crystals of calcium sulfate."

The soil formed in fine textured calcareous parent material weathered from shale.  Elevation is usually in excess of 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 30 to 85 days."
