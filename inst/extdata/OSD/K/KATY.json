(E, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nPale feature: Many coarse redox concentrations with chroma of 6 or more and clay does not decrease by as much as 20 percent absolute from the maximum clay content within 152 cm (60 in) of the soil surface.\nAdditional Comments: Classification change from thermic to hyperthermic temperature regime is based on geographic distribution of the series.  In January 2003, classification was changed from an Aquic to Oxyaquic subgroup. A further refinement in soil moisture classification from Oxyaquic to Typic occurred because of the update of MLRA 150A. This change was based on soil moisture monitoring data collected on soils in the area.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S55TX-157-093 from the series type location in Fort Bend County and on Kellogg Soil Survey lab pedon number 05N0203.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  National Soil Survey Laboratory soil characterization data exists on pedon 40A4455 (S55TX-157-093) from the type location in Fort Bend County, Texas.
