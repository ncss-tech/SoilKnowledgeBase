  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Coarse fragments, mostly rounded quartzite or sandstone gravels, range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral in the surface layer and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the subsoil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizons have hues of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. They commonly have soft iron masses in shades of yellow, red or brown. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or less commonly, loam.\nThe CBg or Cg horizons, where present, have hues of 7.5YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 1 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 4. Textures and amount of redoximorphic features is similar to the lower Btg horizons."

Allegheny, Cotaco, Orrville and Rowdy soils are fine-loamy. Grigsby soils are coarse-loamy. Skidmore soils are loamy-skeletal. Allegheny, Grigsby, Nolin, Rowdy and Skidmore soils are well drained. Cotaco and Morehead soils are moderately well or somewhat poorly drained. Newark and Orrville soils are somewhat poorly drained. Grigsby, Lindside, Morehead, Melvin, Newark, Nolin, Rowdy and Skidmore soils lack argillic horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Knowlton series replaces areas previously included with the Morehead or Melvin series. The series may also be useful in replacing 1,210 acres of Peoga soils with a low base that were correlated in Montgomery County, Kentucky. The 2005 update revises the pedon description with terminology from version 2.0 of the \"Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils\" after review of the original field notes. A map compilation error has placed the OSD location for this series in a delineation of Ne-Newark silt loam, frequently flooded map unit and is slated for correction during routine maintenance (Soil Survey of Powell and Wolfe Counties, Kentucky, 1993).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epidepon - The zone from the surface to a depth of about 6 inches. (Ap)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from approximately 6 to 66 inches. (BE, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3)\nRedoximorphic features - The zone from 0 to 66 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data pedon S86-KY-197-2.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
