    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kapua soils are on mid elevation, leeward slopes on the upland of Mauna Loa Volcano at elevations of 305 to 1067 meters (1,000 to 3,500 feet). These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a flows that are 750 to 3,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 508 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1524 millimeters (50 to 60 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 17 to 21 degrees C (63 to 70 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
