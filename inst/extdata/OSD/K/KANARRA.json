They occur on fan remnants, structural benches, and mountain slopes and formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from intermediate igneous rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7.0 to 9.5 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
