  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanarra series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from intermediate igneous rocks. Kanarra soils occur on fan remnants, structural benches and mountain slopes and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
