  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from about 30 to 45 inches. These soils are usually dry but are not continuously dry for as long as 60 consecutive days. The average soil temperature is more than 59 degrees F. and less than 71.6 degrees F. The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma from 2 or 3. Commonly, the A horizon and the upper part of the B2t horizon are noncalcareous to depths of 10 to 15 inches but some pedons are calcareous at the surface. The B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has weak to moderate coarse prismatic parting to moderate blocky structure. The C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR. Lime accumulation in the lower part of the solum and upper C horizon ranges from 8 to 15 percent."

Concho, Cueva, DeMaya, LeBrier, Remunda, and Swastika soils have an average annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F. Also, DeMaya soils have mollic epipedons thick than 20 inches. Musquiz soils have reddish brown, red, reddish yellow or yellowish red B22t horizons, and the hue is mainly 2.5YR and 5YR in the B21t horizon. Tucumcari soils have ochric epipedons and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Kinkead soils are on nearly level to gently sloping broad alluvial fans. The soils formed in loamy calcareous sediment from sandstone shale and Ogallala formations. The climate is semiarid continental. At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 16 inches, most of which is received during the growing season. The average annual temperature is 57 degrees F. The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 24."
