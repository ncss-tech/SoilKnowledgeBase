  "OVERVIEW": "The Kawaihapai series consists of well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous rock. Kawaihapai soils are in drainageways and on alluvial fans on the coastal plains and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 889 millimeters (35 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (73 degrees F.)",
