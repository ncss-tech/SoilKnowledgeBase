These soils formed in glacial drift with an influence of ash over dense glaciomarine deposits. They occur in a mild marine climate having an average annual precipitation ranging from 762 to  1270 mm. Mean January temperature is 4 degrees C; mean July temperature is 14 degrees C; and mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. The summers are cool and dry. Winters are mild and wet with most of the annual precipitation occurring as rain from November through March. The frost-free season is about 150 to 220 days."

Units were changed to metric and the range in characteristics was formatted to semi-tabular. More laboratory data needs to be collected to justify current classification.\n2000: Classification revised 1/200 from Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Andic Durochrepts to a Coarse-loamy isotic, mesic Andic Dystroxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy. Depths to diagnostic horizons and features noted in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nThis series needs further clarification as to the range in which redox depletions (chroma <2) can be found. As defined presently, if depletions occur between 50 and 75 cm, aquic subgroup criteria would be met. This pedon does not meet Aquic subgroup criteria.\n1994: Classification changed from a Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic ortstein Aquic Haplorthods to aa Coarse-loamy, mized, mesic Andic Durochrepts because of 1994 amendments to Soil Taxonomy.   The Cr horizon was changed to Cd at that time\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
