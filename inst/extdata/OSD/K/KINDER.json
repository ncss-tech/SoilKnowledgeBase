  "OVERVIEW": "The Kinder series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils.  These nearly level coastal prairie soils formed in loamy alluvium of late Pleistocene age or in loamy deltaic sediments over Pleistocene age terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61 in).",
