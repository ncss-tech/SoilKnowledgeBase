  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  The soils are continuously dry in the control section for one-half the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but the soils are moist during the winter.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 10 to 30 inches except where under long periods of irrigation. The particle-size control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.  Thin horizons of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loam or silt loam are in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  The horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AB and Bk horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry in the upper part and value of 3 moist and 4 thru 6 dry in the lower part.  The chroma is 2 or 3.  The structure is weak or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky.  This horizon is neutral to strongly alkaline.  It is sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has 2 to 8 percent calcium carbonate.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture below a depth of 40 inches commonly is highly stratified ranging from sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand and sand.  This horizon is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  It has 2 to 5 percent calcium carbonate.  Some pedons have gravel at 40 to 60 inches."
