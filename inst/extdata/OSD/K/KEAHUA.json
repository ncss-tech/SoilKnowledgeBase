Uwala soils have moderately thick patchy coatings on peds in the upper part of the B2 horizon and have strong structure in the lower part of the B2 horizon.  Wahikuli soils have a clayey control section and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Waiakoa soils have prismatic structure in the B horizon and are 20 to 40 inches deep.  Waikapu soils have slickensides in the lower part of the B horizon."
