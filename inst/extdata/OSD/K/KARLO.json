  "OVERVIEW": "The Karlo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Karlo soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
