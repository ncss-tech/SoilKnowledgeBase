  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingsriver series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Kingsriver soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are commonly 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
