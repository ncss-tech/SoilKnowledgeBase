Kikoni soils have a massive B horizon overlying 2Bw horizons that have strong structure. Kapapala soils have a depositional ashy course sand 2C horizon. Kiolakaa soils are moderately deep. Kula soils have a cobbly loam surface texture. Waimea soils are nonsticky and nonplastic in the A and upper part of the B horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to gently sloping lava flows that are greater than 5,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 760 to 1520 millimeters (30 to 60 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges from 18 to 21 degrees C. (65 to 70 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
