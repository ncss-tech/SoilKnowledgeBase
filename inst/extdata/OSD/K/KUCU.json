    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section: The zone from 0 to 79 inches.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 5 to 15 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 5 inches.  (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 5 to 15 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 15 to 38 inches.  (2Bk1, 2Bk2, 2Bk3 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bk horizon.\nOther features: The 2Bk2 horizon has 80 percent cemented material with troweled and laminar surfaces.  The material is not continuous enough to qualify as a petrocalcic horizon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nThe alluvial deposits for this soil are from ancient Mancos River deposits.  Source for the igneous material is the La Plata Mountains 25 miles to the northeast.  The Mancos River is now located approximately 8 miles northwest and 1000 feet lower in elevation than the type location.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
