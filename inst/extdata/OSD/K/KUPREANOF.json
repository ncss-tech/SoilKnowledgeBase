  "OVERVIEW": "The Kupreanof series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and glacial till.  Kupreanof soils occur on moraines and mountain sideslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 100  percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 90 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. The solum ranges from 9 to 45 inches thick.  There is more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 35 to 75 percent with 25 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 40 percent cobble.  Tree throw and soil creep has resulted in mixing and churning of horizons in many profiles.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from ultra acid to slightly acid.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value moist from 3 to 7, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is  loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 30 percent, with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobble.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value moist from 2 to 5, and chroma moist from 0 to 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is loam, coarse sandy loam or sandy loam. Hue ranges from 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value from 2 to 6, and chroma from 1 to 6."
