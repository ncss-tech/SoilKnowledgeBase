    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. The solum ranges from 9 to 45 inches thick.  There is more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 35 to 75 percent with 25 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 40 percent cobble.  Tree throw and soil creep has resulted in mixing and churning of horizons in many profiles.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from ultra acid to slightly acid.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value moist from 3 to 7, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is  loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 30 percent, with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobble.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value moist from 2 to 5, and chroma moist from 0 to 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is loam, coarse sandy loam or sandy loam. Hue ranges from 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value from 2 to 6, and chroma from 1 to 6."

Deming, Saar and Shuksan soils have volcanic ash within the control section.  Foad, Hinker and Thader soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface. Karta soils have paralithic compact till within 40 inches of the surface.  Mitkof soils are mottled in the control section."

The climate is humid maritime with the average annual precipitation ranging from 21 to 150 inches.  The slope gradient commonly is 10 to 50, but the range is 2 to 100 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 48 degrees F.  Elevations range from 0 to 3000 feet.  The frost free season is 90 to 150 days."
