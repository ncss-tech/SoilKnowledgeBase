Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent fine pebbles by volume.  These soils have soil temperatures greater than 41 degrees F.  at 20 inches for 195 to 220 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  When colors in parts of the upper 7 inches are 3/3 moist, colors after mixing are non-mollic.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  This horizon typically has clay that ranges from 21 to 31 percent, silt from 10 to 50 percent, and sand 40 to 70 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent fine pebbles by volume.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizons have a hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  These horizons are typically loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam, but clay ranges from 20 to 35 percent, silt ranges from 10 to 50 percent, and sand from 30 to 70 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 fine pebbles by volume.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

They formed in alluvial and mixed eolian and alluvial material derived from tertiary material.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 to 16 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 135 to 155 days."

Ascalon, Sampson, Pleasant, Satanta, Wages, Eckley, Nunn, Weld, Norka, and Richfield soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Pleasant, Ulmet, Weld, Nunn, and Richfield soils are fine textured.  Stoneham, Wiley, and Fort Collins soils have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons.  Otero soil is coarse-loamy.  Schamber soil is sandy-skeletal.  Colby and Wiley soils are fine-silty.  Canyon soil is shallow to weathered rock from the Ogallala Formation."
