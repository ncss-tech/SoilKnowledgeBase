Texture of the bands ranges from loamy sand to silt loam.  Laumaia soils have a cemented sandy ash layer at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Olinda soils have an ochric epipedon and are weakly smeary in the B horizon.  Paaiki soils are silty clay in the lower part of the B horizon and have a mean annual soil temperature of 60 degrees F.  Pane soils have prismatic structure in the upper B horizon, are weakly smeary throughout the B horizon and have a mean annual soil temperature of 66 degrees F.  Tantalus soils have an ashy over cindery control section and a mean annual soil temperature of 70 degrees F.  Umikoa soils have value of 2 or 3 in the A horizon and have moderate structure throughout the B horizon."
