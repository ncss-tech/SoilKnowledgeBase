  "OVERVIEW": "The Kettner series consists of shallow, well-drained, noncalcareous soils on gently undulating uplands.  The slope range is 3 to 20 percent.  These soils developed over schist.  They occur at elevations of 8,100 to 8,300 feet, where the annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches and the average annual temperature is 44? F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to weathered schist is commonly 15 to 20 inches, but it may be as little as 13 inches in places.  Although loam is the dominant texture of the surface layer, the texture is sandy loam or gravelly loam in places.  The texture of the substratum is loam or sandy loam.  The color ranges from 10YR to 7.5YR in hue.  The soil colors are inherited from the parent schist."
