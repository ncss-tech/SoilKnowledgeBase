  "REVDATE": "11/2015",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Knott series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess high in volcanic ash.  Knott soils are on fan-piedmont remnants and partial ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
