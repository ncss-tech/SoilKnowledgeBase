  "OVERVIEW": "The Keeno series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands with a fragipan at depths of 18 to 36 inches. These soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan. Slopes range from 2 to 14 percent. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Ex and 2Btx horizons have mottled colors of red, gray, and brown.

Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.
