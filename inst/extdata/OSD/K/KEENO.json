    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The dark colored surface horizons range from 10 to 30 inches in thickness and in some pedons include all or part of the argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent in part of the argillic horizon above the fragipan.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry); and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of silt loam or loam.  It is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR; value of 3 to 5 (5 to 7 dry); and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Ex and 2Btx horizons have mottled colors of red, gray, and brown. They are very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam or their very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid."
