    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cruze, Grassland, Halifax, Keyport, Lackstown, Latham, and Zoar series. Cruze soils have bedrock at depths less than 60 inches. Grassland soils contain more than 40 percent silt throughout the profile. Halifax, Keyport, and Lackstown soils formed in residuum and contain less rock fragments throughout the profile. Latham soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Zoar soils contain less rock fragments throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kanuga soils are on nearly level to moderately steep high stream terraces, alluvial fans, or foot slopes along the broader stream and river valleys of the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B).  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from about 1,800 to 2,800 feet.  These soils formed in old alluvium washed from materials weathered from low or high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks such as mica gneiss, hornblende gneiss, granite, metasandstone, and phyllite. Mean annual air temperature is 56 and ranges from about 50 to 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation 48 and ranges from about 35 to 60 inches."

Brevard and Tate soils formed in colluvium or alluvium on nearby toe slopes, benches, and fans are in a fine-loamy particle-size class. Clifton, Cowee, Edneyville, and Evard soils formed in residuum on adjacent uplands and are well drained. Swannanoa soils are somewhat poorly drained."
