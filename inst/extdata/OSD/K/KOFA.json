  "OVERVIEW": "The Kofa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium from mixed sources.  Kofa soils are on flood plains and have slopes 0 to 3 percent, but are generally less than 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 3 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 74 degrees F.",
