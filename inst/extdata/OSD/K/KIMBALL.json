They formed in alluvium from a variety of sources including sedimentary, metasedimentary, metabasic and granitic rock.  Elevations range from 30 to 1,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches.  Mean January temperature is 46 degrees to 50 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 75 degrees to 80 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges from 250 to 300 days."

Altamont soils have clay textures throughout and are on hills above Kimball.  Arbuckle soils have less than 35 percent clay and are on alluvial fans.  Bruella and Perkins soils have less than 35 percent clay and are on stream terraces often dissecting areas of Kimball soils.  Corning soils have moist values in the A horizon of more than 4 and are on relatively older, higher terraces.  Hillgate soils have moist values in the A horizon of more than 4.  San Joaquin soils have a duripan at 20 to 40 inches and are in similar landscape positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n10/2006 minor edits, changed runoff terminology.\nThe Hopeton series is inactivated and combined with the Kimball series.  Some of the soils mapped as Kimball series in the Ventura area soil survey are taxadjunct to the Kimball series because colors are redder and rock fragment content is higher than the range defined for Kimball series.  Soils as mapped in Contra Costa Co. which have lime in the series control sections are also excluded in this revision.  Difference in very fine sand content on a clay free basis between the BAt and Bt is 6 percent and is not considered enough to be a discontinuity.  Soils mapped as Kimball with a duripan below a depth of 40 inches are now excluded from the concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Ap1, Ap2, Ap3, A).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 46 inches (2Btss, 2Bt).\nPale great group - It has an abrupt upper boundary with an absolute clay increase of 15 to 30 percent more than the overlying horizon.\nMollic subgroup - organic matter is 1.2 to 3 percent in the upper part of the ochric epipedon.\nCEC class was assumed.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference pedons RP84CA-115-26-2 for organic carbon and RP84CA-115-26-6 for mineralogy and base saturation by NSSL.  Sampled by U.C. Davis l984 for particle size analysis on the 2Bt horizon.  Type location sampled by University of California as 59CAL-04-2-1 to 8 in April, l959, for complete characterization.
