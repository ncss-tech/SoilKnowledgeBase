    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 15 to\n35 inches, thicknesses greater than 24 inches being where\ntongues of B horizon extend into C horizon.  Degree of tonguing ranges from none to amplitudes of 20 inches spaced 2 to 6 feet\napart.  Rock fragments range from pebbles to stones in size and\nrange from 3 to 40 percent of the A horizon, 35 to 50 percent of\nthe B horizon and 35 to 70 percent of the IIC horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The\nsoil is medium acid to neutral in the A horizon, slightly acid\nor neutral in the B horizon, and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of\n2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  It has weak to moderate granular structure and very friable or friable consistence.  The A2 horizon is commonly\ndestroyed by plowing or is present as discontinuous remnants.\nIt has hue of 10YR, values of 5 or 6, and chromas of 2 to 4.\nThe A2 horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the\nfine earth fraction.  It is massive or it has platy structure.\nIt is very friable or friable.\nThe B horizon has hues of 5YR to 10YR, values of 4 or 5, and\nchromas of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam\nin the fine earth fraction.  The B horizon is massive or it has\nvery weak or weak subangular blocky structure.  It is very\nfriable or friable.  The lower part is calcareous in some\npedons.\nThe IIC horizon has hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5,\nand chromas of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand or sand in the fine\nearth fraction.  It is single grain and loose, and is\ncalcareous."

Bonaparte soils lack an argillic horizon.  Conotton soils lack interfingering.  Palmyra soils have fine-\nloamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control\nsections."
