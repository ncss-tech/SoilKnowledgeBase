  "OVERVIEW": "The Kovich series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks, mainly sandstone, andesite and quartzite on flood plains, alluvial fans and broad valley floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 24 to 38 inches.  The soils are saturated with water at some period during the year.  Distinct or prominent masses of iron accumulation occur within a depth of 30 inches and are in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.  Small areas near seeps and springs have thin peaty surface layers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 0 to 4.  It is stratified and ranges from fine sandy loam, very gravelly or extremely cobbly fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam in the upper portion and is very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy fine sand, or very gravelly loamy sand below a depth of about 40 inches. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

Crooked Creek and Downata soils are on level to nearly level flood-plains and low stream terraces.  Acord and Rexburg soils lack a cumulic mollic epipedon. Acord soils have an argillic horizon and a clayey-skeletal particle size control section.  Rexburg soils have a calcic horizon, lack a skeletal discontinuity, and have a coarse-silty particle size control section.  Crooked Creek and Downata soils have fine and fine silty particle size control sections respectively and lack skeletal discontinuities."
