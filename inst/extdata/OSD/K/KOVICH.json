  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 63 degrees F.\nThe mollic epipedon is more than 24 inches thick and organic matter content decreases irregularly as depth increases.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 24 to 38 inches.  The soils are saturated with water at some period during the year.  Distinct or prominent masses of iron accumulation occur within a depth of 30 inches and are in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.  Small areas near seeps and springs have thin peaty surface layers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 0 to 4.  It is stratified and ranges from fine sandy loam, very gravelly or extremely cobbly fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam in the upper portion and is very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy fine sand, or very gravelly loamy sand below a depth of about 40 inches. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kovich soils occur on flood-plains, stream terraces, low lying alluvial fans and broad valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, andesite and quartzite.  Elevations range from 4,900 to 8,200 feet.  The climate is moist subhumid with 14 to 25 inches average annual precipitation.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 60 to 110 days."

Crooked Creek and Downata soils are on level to nearly level flood-plains and low stream terraces.  Acord and Rexburg soils lack a cumulic mollic epipedon. Acord soils have an argillic horizon and a clayey-skeletal particle size control section.  Rexburg soils have a calcic horizon, lack a skeletal discontinuity, and have a coarse-silty particle size control section.  Crooked Creek and Downata soils have fine and fine silty particle size control sections respectively and lack skeletal discontinuities."
