  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used entirely as rangeland. The climax plant community is a tall grass and mid grass, oak savannah. The dominant grass is little bluestem. The other grasses are sideoats grama, tall grama, yellow Indiangrass, silver bluestem, slim tridens, pinhole bluestem, cane bluestem, tall dropseed, hairy grama, and perennial threeawns. The dominant forbs include Engelmann daisy, bushsunflower, and sensitive briar. The woody plants include live oak, Texas oak, flameleaf sumac, evergreen sumac, agarito, and greenbriar.  With continued over grazing, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of sideoats grama, seep muhly and live oak. If continuous heavy grazing continues for many years, Ashe juniper will increase and form a dense stand with an understory of plants, such as Texas grama, red grama, puff sheath dropseed, Lindheimer muhly, and Texas persimmon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Brackett series. Brackett soils do not have a lithic contact and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section.\nClassification changed from Typic Ustochrepts to Typic Calciustepts recognizing a calcic in the Bk1 horizon.\nThe correct classification of the typical pedon as described is loamy rather than loamy-skeletal particle size class.  It was not changed from its original classification until a study is completed.  The pararock fragments function like rock fragments in the soil for most uses.\nEdited 11/2013 (RFG-JRJ): Updated the competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 20 to 38 cm (8 to 15 in) (Bk1 horizon)\nLithic contact: 61 cm (24 in) (top of R layer)\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory data on S63TX171-1\n(40A34405-34409), and S63TX031-1 (40A34400-34404).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
