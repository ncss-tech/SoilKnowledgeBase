  "STATES": "IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kato series consists of poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in a 20 to 40 inch mantle of silty sediments over sandy or gravelly sandy glacial outwash sediments.  These soils are on glacial outwash plains and valley trains.  They have moderate permeability in the solum and rapid permeability in the 2C horizon.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the 2C horizon typically ranges from 24 to 36 inches with an extreme range of 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to free carbonates typically ranges from 48 to 60 inches with an extreme range of 40 to 65 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is N 2/ or N 3/.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It typically is neutral but ranges to slightly acid and to mildly alkaline in the upper part in some pedons.\nThe B horizon matrix has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has distinct or prominent mottles in most to all parts.  It typically is neutral or slightly acid but ranges to strongly acid in some pedons.  The Bg horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The BC horizon is loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon typically has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 through 8; and chroma of 1 through 3.  It typically is stratified sand or coarse sand with up to 20 percent coarse fragments but is loamy sand in some pedons.  The upper part typically is slightly acid or neutral, and it becomes mildly alkaline and calcareous with depth."
