  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the 2C horizon typically ranges from 24 to 36 inches with an extreme range of 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to free carbonates typically ranges from 48 to 60 inches with an extreme range of 40 to 65 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is N 2/ or N 3/.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It typically is neutral but ranges to slightly acid and to mildly alkaline in the upper part in some pedons.\nThe B horizon matrix has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has distinct or prominent mottles in most to all parts.  It typically is neutral or slightly acid but ranges to strongly acid in some pedons.  The Bg horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The BC horizon is loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon typically has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 through 8; and chroma of 1 through 3.  It typically is stratified sand or coarse sand with up to 20 percent coarse fragments but is loamy sand in some pedons.  The upper part typically is slightly acid or neutral, and it becomes mildly alkaline and calcareous with depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the family.  Similar soils include the Biscay, Hanska, and Marshan.  Biscay and Marshan soils are fine-loamy in the upper part of the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Hanska soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kato soils are on plane or slightly concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent predominantly on outwash plains and valley trains but on flood plains in some areas.  They formed in a 20 to 40 inch thick mantle of loess or silty outwash sediments over coarse textured outwash.  These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 26 to 32 inches."
