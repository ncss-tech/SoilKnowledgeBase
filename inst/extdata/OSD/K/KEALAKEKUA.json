  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kealakekua soils are on mid elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from 305 to 1067 meters (1,000 to 3,500 feet).  These soils occur on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to steep pahoehoe flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a or pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1270 to 2030 millimeters (50 to 80 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1020 millimeters (25 to 40 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 71 degrees F).  Mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
