  "OVERVIEW": "The Keyesville series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils moderately deep to sandstone bedrock.  These upland soils formed in loamy slope alluvium over sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone.  These soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy slope alluvium, rapid in the sandy residuum, and moderate or moderately slow in the sandstone.  Slope ranges from 20 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 2 to 10 centimeters.\nCambic horizon: The zone from 10 to 61 centimeters.\nParalithic contact: The contact with sandstone at 61 centimeters.\nThe Jordan Formation is interstratified with finer strata in places. However, the loamy slope alluvium is not from this formation but rather from the mixing of the loess and mass wasting of the clayey pedisediment (Rountree) from the surrounding Oneota and Shakopee Formations, which dominate the area. The 5YR and 7.5YR hues are indicative of this material. The Basco series, which also is formed from the mass wasting of the clayey pedisediment, is mapped on the higher positions on the landscape.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None available at this time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
