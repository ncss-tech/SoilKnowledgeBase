  "OVERVIEW": "The Kiva series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy deposits overlying sand and gravel on outwash plains, lake plains, stream terraces, kames, eskers, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
