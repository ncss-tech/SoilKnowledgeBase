  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 41 to 91 cm (16 to 36 inches). That part of the soil developed in lacustrine sediments ranges to as much as 102 cm (40 inches) thick. The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 inches) in thickness. The 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inch) particle size control section averages between 35 and 60 percent clay and 5 to 20 percent fine sand and coarser. The lower part of the series control section has 30 to 55 percent clay, content of sand from 10 to 30 percent with a bulk density of 1.6 to 1.8 gm/cc. Rock fragments typically make up 0 to 2 percent of the upper mantle, when present, and 2 to 10 percent of the underlying material. Shale is a common component of the gravel size fraction.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam or clay. The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay, clay, clay loam or silty clay loam. It is slightly acid to neutral. Ped exteriors have common to many coatings of organic matter and commonly are 1 or 2 units lower in chroma and/or value than ped interiors.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay, silty clay, clay loam or clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Soft masses and threads of free carbonates are common throughout.\nSome pedons have a 2Bkg horizon that is similar to the Bkg but has more coarse fragments and a higher percentage of sand.\nThe BCg or Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2BCg or 2Cg horizon that is similar to the BCg or Cg but has more coarse fragments and a higher percentage of sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kandiyohi soils are on plane to convex slope positions on slight rises and knolls within ground moraines and benches. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. They soils formed in a fine textured mantle over underlying firm till. The glacial till is thought to be pre-Wisconsin in age and referred to a Kandiyohi till locally. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is 660 to 711 mm (24 to 28 inches). Frost free days range from 140 to 155. Elevation above sea level is from 320 to 381 m (1050 to 1250 feet)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arkton, Corvuso, Cosmos, Lura, Newlondon and Strout soils. Cosmos, Lura and Strout soils form a hydrosequence with Kandiyohi soils. Moderately well drained Arkton and Newlondon soils are calcareous throughout and are on shoulders. Moderately well drained Strout soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes. Poorly drained Cosmos soils are on nearly level lower lying landscape positions. Poorly drained Danielson soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are on footslopes. Poorly drained Corvuso soils are on rims of closed depressions. Very poorly drained Lura soils are in closed depressions."

The saturated hydraulic conductivity is .42 to 1.41 micrometers per second (.06 to .2 inches per hour). Seasonal high perched saturation occurs at depths of 46 cm (1.5 feet) at some time during October to July in normal years."
