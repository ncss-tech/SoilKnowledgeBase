  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanutchan series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in fine textured materials from tuffs, volcanic breccias, and andesite.  Kanutchan soils are in drainage basins on mountains and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are saturated with water for several months each year but are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 consecutive days or more during the 90 days after the summer solstice.  The soils crack open and close once in most years. Chroma is 1 or less throughout the solum.  The particle-size control section averages 45 to 60 percent clay and averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments, of which 0 to 10 percent are gravel and 0 to 5 percent are cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is moderately or slightly acid.  It has 4 to 8 percent organic matter.\nThe AC and C horizons are neutral or have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  Rock fragments average 0 to 15 percent of which 0 to 10 percent are gravel and 0 to 5 percent are cobbles.  It is slightly acid to neutral."
