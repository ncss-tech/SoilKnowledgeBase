  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenray series consists of deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments derived from sandstone.  Kenray soils are on dunes and mesas.  Slope is 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
