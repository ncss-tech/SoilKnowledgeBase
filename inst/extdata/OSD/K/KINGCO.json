  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 65 to more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section has 40 to 55 percent clay. This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls 3 to 8 inches higher than microdepressions.  Distance between the center of the microknoll and the center of the microdepression is about 5 to 15 feet.  The microknoll makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate, or area between the knoll and depression, about 45 percent, and the microdepression about 30 percent.  When dry, cracks 0.5 to 2 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of 30 inches or more.   Cracks are more prominent in the microdepressions.  The cracks remain open for 150 or more cumulative days during most years.  Slickensides begin at a depth of 6 to 21 inches and extend to a depth of 45 to 60 inches which corresponds to the depth to the BC or BCk horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or less.  Horizons with chroma of 1 average less than 7 inches thick.  More than half of the surface layer consists of chroma of 2.   Moist color value is 2 or 3.  Thickness of the A horizon varies with microrelief, ranging from 6 to 12 inches.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from non-effervescent to slightly effervescent and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons an A2 horizon is present.  It has same texture, color and reaction as the A1 horizon.  It ranges from 3 to 15 inches thick.\nThe Bss1 horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Chroma of 3 occurs in the microknolls and comprises less than half of this layer.  Moist color value is 2 or 3.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from non-effervescent to strongly effervescent and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Moist color value is 3 or 4.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Very fine or fine concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  Masses of gypsum range from few to common in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent and is moderately alkaline.\nThe BC and/or BCk horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Moist color value is 3 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam or clay.  Some pedons have coatings of calcium carbonate between peds.  Hard and soft powdery masses of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  A few crystals of gypsum are usually present, and some pedons contain as much as 10 percent.  Reaction ranges from non-effervescent to strongly effervescent and is moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cd horizon, where present, is reddish weathered shale and clays of the Blaine Formation (Permian System).  Grayish and greenish strata, mottles and thin lenses of gypsum are common.  Reaction ranges from non-effervescent to strongly effervescent and is moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Campwood, Hollister, Indiahoma, Irion, Lipan, McLean, Reap, Southplains and  Stamford soils.  Campwood soils have 20 to 40 percent calcium carbonate in the upper subsoil and are derived from Cretaceous sediments.  Hollister soils have smectitic mineralogy and slickensides extend to depths greater than 60 inches.  Indiahoma soils have linear shaped microhighs that comprise 25 to 50 percent of the pedon.  The surface layer of the microhigh is dominated by chroma of 3 to 6 and the microhigh sola is commonly less than 60 inches thick.  Irion soils have indurated Cretaceous age platy limestone between 60 and 80 inches.  Lipan and Reap soils have moist values of 4 or higher.  McLean and Southplains soils occupy playa basins and occur on elevations 2700 feet and higher.  Stamford soils have sola 50 inches or less thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kingco soils are in slightly concave flats and very gently sloping areas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in clayey sediments deposited from nearby erosional uplands, backswamps of ancient streams and other outwashes that deposited clayey sediments over the Blaine Formation of Permian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 1600 to 1850 feet.  Frost free days range from 210 to 230.  Thornthwaite P-E indices is 34 to 38."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Quanah, Roscoe, Tilvern, Vernon, and Westill soils.  Quanah soils are on higher loamy footslope deposits and have fine-silty particle-size control sections.  Tilvern and Vernon soils are on lower sloping positions and have ochric epipedons and sola less than 60 inches thick.  Roscoe soils are in somewhat poorly drained depressional areas.  Westill soils are on slightly higher positions on broad flats and have argillic horizons."
