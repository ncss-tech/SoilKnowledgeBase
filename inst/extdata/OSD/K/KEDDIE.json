    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The mean winter soil temperature varies from 34 degrees to 36 degrees F and the mean summer soil temperature varies form 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.  These soils are usually saturated during the late winter and spring due to a seasonal water table at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  A wet phase has a seasonal watertable at a depth of 0 to 20 inches from December thru May.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is loam, gravelly loam or stratified loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam and clay loam.  When mixed, the average texture is loam or gravelly loam, the weighted average clay content is 18 to 27 percent, and the sand content ranges from 40 to 50 percent.  Gravelly phases have 15 to 30 percent gravel.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 25 to 34 inches.  Depth to mottles ranges from 0 to 15 inches.  Organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3 5/4; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 2/1, 3/2 or N2/.   Texture is loam, sandy loam clay loam or muck with 0 to 5 percent gravel, or gravelly loam with 15 to 30 percent gravel.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 6/1, 6/3, 7/2, 6/4 4/6; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 7/4 or 5Y 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3 4/4; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 5Y 2.5/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/1 or 5/2.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have buried A horizons at a depth of 39 to 50 inches and have moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2.5Y 2/1 or N2/.  Gley colors of 5G 4/2 5GY 4/1 or 4/2 are at a depth of 30 to 46 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons have stratified very gravelly loamy coarse sand through very gravelly sandy clay loam below a depth of 40 inches.  Silty clay loam and silty clay substratum phases are recognized that have 27 to 35 percent clay at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

Gielow soil have clay films in a Bt horizon and a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F. The James Canyon soils have gravelly loam or gravelly silt loam control sections with less than 40 percent sand and are in a semiarid climate with 8 to 16 inches of precipitation.  The Kimmerling and Konner soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The McClave soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth and have peak periods of precipitation in spring and early summer.  The Peoh soils have clay loam and sandy clay loam control sections, and have Bg horizons.  The Wenas soils have a Bg horizon which is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Mannahah soils ?????"
