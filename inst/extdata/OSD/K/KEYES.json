    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches with the greater depths on mound areas.  Mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F and remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year. The soil is dry between 9 inches and the duripan in most years for a period of 115 to 135 days from June 1 to October 15, moist in all parts for a period of 120 to 150 days from December 1 to May 1 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  Average clay content of the textural control section is 35 to 50 percent.  Weighted average content of coarse fragments is 15 to 35 percent in the control section.  Increase in clay content at the upper boundary of, or at a horizon boundary within, the argillic horizon is 15 to 25 percent absolute, within 1 inch.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; or 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4, 7.5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 or 4/4.  Mottles or slightly darker and grayer colors occur in the surface 1 to 3 inches in intermound areas.  Some part of the upper 7 inches of the A horizon has a value of 6 dry, 4 moist or a chroma of 4 moist.  Where cobbles are present, the soils are usually cobbly in the intermound areas and gravelly on the mound areas.  Texture is sandy loam, cobbly or gravelly loam or clay loam.  Content of coarse fragments is 5 to 35 percent with 0 to 15 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4, 5/4; or 5YR 4/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4; or 5YR 3/3.  Texture is gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam. Content of coarse fragments is 15 to 35 percent with 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon is 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/4 or 5/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4 or 4/4. Texture is gravelly clay but is heavy clay loam in the upper part of some pedons.  Content of coarse fragments is 15 to 35 percent with 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Some subhorizons have 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments with 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bqm horizon is often a combination of colors.  It is 10YR 5/4, 7/4; 7.5YR 5/6; 5YR 5/6 or 7/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 7/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6; or 5YR 4/6.  The duripan is continuously silica cemented and is indurated to weakly cemented.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons, bedrock is below the duripan.\nThe 2C horizon is stratified very gravelly or cobbly loamy coarse sand to cobbly or gravelly sandy loam.  Content of coarse fragments averages 45 to 60 percent.  It is very weakly silica cemented in some areas. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Keyes soils are on fans, terraces and hills at elevations of 130 to 600 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from valley fill sediments consisting of andesitic gravel, cobbles and tuff.  Some of the gravel in the material above the 2Bt horizons is metamorphic gravel.  The sediments are predominantly of the Mehrten Formation.  Coarse fragments of andesite in the profile are very well rounded.  The soils have mound-intermound microrelief in undisturbed areas.  The microrelief is only weakly expressed in Sacramento County.  Climate is subhumid, with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F, average January temperature is 45 degrees F and average July temperature is 79 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 250 to 275 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This is a classification change from fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Durixeralfs to clayey, mixed, thermic, shallow Abruptic Durixeralfs. CEC class added in 1996.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 8 inches (A, AB)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 16 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2)\nDuripan - the zone from 16 to 30 inches (2Bqm)\nAbruptic subgroup - clay increase of 21 percent, absolute, at the abrupt boundary between the Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons.\nMixed mineralogy - the mineralogy of the upper and lower parts of the argillic horizon are mixed.  The 15 bar water to clay ratio of the upper and lower parts of the argillic are .37 and .44, respectively.\nCEC- was assumed.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon sampled as Cal. 50-8-1-(1 to 5), Soils Department, University of California at Davis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
