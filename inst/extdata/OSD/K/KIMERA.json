  "OVERVIEW": "The Kimera series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from sedimentary rock.  Kimera soils are on plains, interfluves, ridges, fans, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 millimeters (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
