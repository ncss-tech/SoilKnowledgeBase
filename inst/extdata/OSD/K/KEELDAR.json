  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  The control section is normally gravelly sandy loam but clay averages 5 to 18 percent, silt 5 to 35 percent, and sand 5 to 85 percent.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume and are typically less than 3 inches in diameter but range up to 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from mildly through strongly alkaline.  It is usually gravelly sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  This horizon ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline and has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Keeldar soils are on alluvial fans, high terraces, or valley side slopes.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial parent materials derived from a variety of sources but usually containing a strong influence from sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 61 degrees F."
