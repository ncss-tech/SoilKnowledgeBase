  "REVDATE": "10/2006",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kippers series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum fine-grained sandstone, limestone, and chert.  Kippers soils are on summits and sideslopes of hills and ridges on plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
