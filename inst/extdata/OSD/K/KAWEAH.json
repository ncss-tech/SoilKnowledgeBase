  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaweah series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary and granitic rock. The Kaweah soils are on steep mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 100 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
