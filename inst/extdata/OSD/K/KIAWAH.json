Few to\ncommon concretions are throughout the soil.\nThe A1 or Ap horizons has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value or 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The A horizon is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma\nof 2, with mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  In some pedons,\nthe B horizon is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  It\nis loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  The particle size control\nsection has 3 percent or more clay than the A2 horizon.  Some\npedons have strata less than one inch thick of finer textured material.\nThe C horizon is mottled in various shades of gray, yellow, or\nbrown.  It is sand or fine sand."
