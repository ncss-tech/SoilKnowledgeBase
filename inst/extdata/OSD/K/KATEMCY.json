  "OVERVIEW": "The Katemcy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over schist. These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils are on undulating plains on dissected plateaus. Slope are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in).",
