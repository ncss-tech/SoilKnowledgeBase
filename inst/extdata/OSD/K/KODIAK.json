  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Total thickness of recent volcanic ash varies from only a few inches to 15 inches, but the normal range in thickness is 9 to 12 inches.  In isolated places where much of the ash was washed off shortly after deposition, the uppermost layer may be loamy fine sand.  A few angular cobbles may occur in the B horizon of the buried soil.  The substratum is commonly weathered or transported slate and graywacke, but in places, it consists of other rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kodiak soils are on undulating to steep slopes in glaciated uplands; most commonly they are formed on irregular topography with slopes of 12 to 45 percent.  Parent materials are volcanic ash over glacial till or weathered rock.  The climate is cool maritime.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as range land.  Areas on more gentle and smoother slopes are used for hay or silage and, to a limited extent, for garden vegetables.  Some timber is taken from forested areas.  The native vegetation is mostly tall grass, dominantly bluejoint reedgrass, and associated plants such as fireweed and salmonberry.  Large patches of alder are common.  In some areas, the grass and alder have been invaded and comnpletely replaced by Sitka spruce forest."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The concept of the Kodiak series is poorly defined, especially in regard to substratum materials.    More data is needed to define the central concept or the series should be inactivated (jpm, 4/87).\nSource of the volcanic ash is the 1912 eruption of Mt. Novarupta and Mt.  Katmai on the Alaska Peninsula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
