  "OVERVIEW": "The Kang series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from serpentinite.  These soils occur on broad ridges, sideslopes, and colluvial footslopes and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",

The mean January soil temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F.; the mean July soil temperature is 57 to 71 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F. from February 20 through December 5 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from March 20 through November 15.  The soil is dry between the depths of 8 and 20 inches from mid-July until mid-October in most years and is moist in some or all parts the remainder of the year.\nThe A horizon has colors of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/1, or 3/2.  Clay content varies from 25 to 35 percent.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.  Rock fragments are 15 to 35 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizons have colors of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, or 7.5YR 4/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, or 7.5YR 4/4.  They are cobbly, stony, or very stony or extremely stony clays.  Clay content varies from 45 to 60 percent.  There is a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons which has a light gravelly clay texture.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.  Rock fragments are 35 to 75 percent by volume."
