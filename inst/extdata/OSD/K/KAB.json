Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 1 to 8 percent by volume.\nSome pedons have an O horizon 1 to 3 inches thick.  It is partially to well decomposed organic matter from remains of trees, shrubs, sedges, and forest floor flora.  It has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 1 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe B/E horizon has characteristics similar to the E horizon and Bt horizon respectively.  Some pedons have a E/B horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BCg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.
