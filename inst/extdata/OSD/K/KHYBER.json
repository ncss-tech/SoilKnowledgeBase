Ashmed, Bitter and Timosea soils are dry in the moisture control section during the summer months. Blind soils average fewer rock fragments and have higher clay content in the control section. They also receive more total rainfall and have a MAAT of 59 to 64 degrees F. Bluebird soils receive more total precipitation and have higher clay content in the control section. Highland soils have bedrock at 30 to 40 inches and average fewer rock fragments in the control section. Nellake soils have a MAST of 67 to 71 degrees F., receive less rainfall, and are formed in granitic material. Pinaleno, Soledad, and Topawa soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days, cumulative, between July and October. In addition, Pinaleno soils have a calcic horizon, Soledad soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the control section, and Topawa soils have a MAST of 69 to 72 degrees F. Twobitter soils are on patina surfaces, have a thinner argillic horizon, average fewer rock fragments in the control section, and are underlain by sand. Werewolf soils do not have 40 to 80 percent of the total gravel fraction in the 2 to 5 mm range. In addition, Werewolf soils do not have 1 percent or more visible carbonates throughout the argillic horizon."
