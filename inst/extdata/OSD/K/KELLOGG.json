  "OVERVIEW": "The Kellogg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy lacustrine deposits or outwash and the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",

In MLRA 92 near Lake Superior in Northern Wisconsin, slope ranges up to 30 percent in soils on the edges of lake plains and outwash plains on old shorelines that are dissected. These soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits or outwash and the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F)."
