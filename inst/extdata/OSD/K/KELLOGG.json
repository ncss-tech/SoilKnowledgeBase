  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kellogg soils are on lake plains. Slope gradients are typically 0 to 12 percent. In MLRA 92 near Lake Superior in Northern Wisconsin, slope ranges up to 30 percent in soils on the edges of lake plains and outwash plains on old shorelines that are dissected. These soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits or outwash and the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F)."

The depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 107 cm (1.5 to 3.5 feet) between October and May in normal years. The potential surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately low or low in the clayey material. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy material and slow or very slow in the underlying clayey material."
