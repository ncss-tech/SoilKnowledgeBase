(6 to 18 inches thick)\nCca--21 to 30 inches, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak medium granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and medium roots; common fine, few coarse pores; 35 percent soft angular gravel; moderately calcareous; lime is disseminated and veined; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6). (6 to 10 inches thick)\nR--30 to 40 inches, weathered sandstone and shale bedrock.\nType Location: Morgan County, Utah; 4.5 miles east and 7 miles north of Croydon; 850 feet west and 2,500 feet south of the NE corner of sec. 13, T.5N., R.4E.\nRange in Characteristics: The ochric epipedon ranges from 3 to 6 inches thick. The top of the Cca horizon is immediately below the B2t horizon and is at depths of 13 to 35 inches. Depth to fractured bedrock ranges from 21 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 65 to 85 consecutive days during the summer. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the Al horizon, 0 to 20 percent in the B2t horizon, and 10 to 70 percent in the Cca horizon. Rock fragments below the Al horizon consist of soft, angular fragments of sandstone and shale.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It ranges from loam to silt loam. This horizon is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous, neutral through strongly alkaline, and ranges from 3 to 6 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It ranges from light clay loam to silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam to cobbly sandy clay loam, or gravelly silt loam in some parts . Structure ranges from weak to moderate, very fine through coarse subangular blocky. Clay films are few to continuous, thin and few moderately thick. This horizon is slightly through strongly calcareous, mildly through strongly alkaline, and ranges from 8 to 19 inches thick.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6 dry, 1 through 4 moist. It ranges from loam to gravelly or very cobbly loam, sandy clay loam, or very gravelly silt loam. This horizon ranges from moderately to strongly calcareous, and neutral through strongly alkaline."

Slopes ranges from 25 to 60 percent. these soils formed in residuum and local alluvium weathered from sandstone and shale. The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 70 to 80 days."
