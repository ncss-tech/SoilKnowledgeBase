  "OVERVIEW": "The Kackley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and mixed alluvium. They are on undulating basalt plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Kackley soils have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
