  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact of sandstone or shale is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 70 degrees F. and the soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F. The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry from April to mid-January and is not continuously moist for as long as 90 consecutive days. Gravel ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Eroded phases may occur in areas with concentrated petroleum extraction activities.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2. Soils with dark colors are too thin or too low in organic carbon to qualify as a mollic epipedon. Texture is loam or clay loam. Structure is granular, platy, or subangular blocky structure. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. It is noneffervescent to violently effervescent with disseminated carbonates.\nThe Bw horizon has color of 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2. Texture is loam or clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. It is noneffervescent to strongly effervescent with disseminated carbonates. Some pedons have segregated carbonates.\nThe Bk horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 8/2; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2. Texture is loam, gravelly loam or clay loam. It is commonly massive, but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. Typically, it is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent with segregated threads or soft masses.  Carbonate may also be disseminated. Gypsum crystals in Bky horizons are present in some pedons."

They formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale. The climate is arid and has hot, dry summers and mild, somewhat moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches. Mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 63 to 65 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 275 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Former series description has mean annual precipitation of 6 to 20 inches, which exceeds the limits for a Haplocambid with an aridic moisture regime. The Kettleman series was historically classified as Typic Torriorthents. This was changed to Typic Haplocambids when a cambic horizon was recognized in the Kettleman profile. The presence of a cambic horizon is based on the following characteristics:\n-Soil structure in the cambic horizon.\n-Removal of carbonates or gypsum from the cambic horizon.\n-Accumulation of carbonates or gypsum below the cambic horizon which supports loss of carbonates or gypsum from overlying horizons.\n-Slightly higher clay content in the cambic horizon than the underlying horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
