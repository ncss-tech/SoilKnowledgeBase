  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 85 percent in the control section. Non-carbonatic clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Soil does not crack to the surface. Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A horizon commonly is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam, but the range includes clay, silty clay loam, and silt loam. Calcium carbonate nodules larger than 2 mm make up as much as 15 percent by volume of the A horizon.\nThe A part of the A/B horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. The B part has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam, silt clay, or clay.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. Iron accumulations in shades of brown or yellow, and iron depletions in shades of olive range from few to many. Texture commonly is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, but the range includes clay loam and silt loam. Calcium carbonate nodules larger than 2 mm. or soft masses of calcium carbonate accumulation make up 5 to 15 percent by volume of the Bk horizon.\nThe Bkss horizon consists of thin bedded layers with hue of 5Y and 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow or olive range from few to many. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. Slickensides that intersect are few to many. Masses of calcium carbonate accumulation commonly are concentrated in seams or along pressure faces.\nThe Bk/C horizon, C/Bk or C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8; or it is variegated in shades of yellow, brown, olive, or gray. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Sumter series in the same family, and the Brassfield series in a closely related family. The Sumter series is moderately deep to chalk and weathered bedrock. The Brassfield series has a mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F. and has more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Keiffer soils occur exclusively as open prairie areas on nearly level to moderately sloping topography in the Western Coastal Plain uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. They are formed in calcareous marine sediments or marl of Tertiary age. The climate is humid temperate. The mean annual air temperature is 64 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 54 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Bellwood, Hollywood, Oktibbeha, and Vaiden soils. Bellwood soils are acid throughout. Hollywood soils have smectitic mineralogy. Oktibbeha and Vaiden soils are more acid in the upper sola and are underlain by materials higher in carbonates."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are not used as cropland, pastureland, or woodland. Areas remain as open prairies. Areas that were once cultivated or used for pastureland are returning to their native vegetation. Eastern red cedar, native grasses, forbs, and shrubs grow on these prairies."
