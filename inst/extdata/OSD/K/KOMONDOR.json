  "OVERVIEW": "The Komondor series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed dominantly in alluvium from basalt. Komondor soils are on lava plains. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F .",
