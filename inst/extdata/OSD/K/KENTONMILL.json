    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kentonmill soils are on summits of lava flows.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed residuum and colluvium from basalt with eolian material influence. Elevations are 1850 to 1950 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches; mean annual air temperature is 69 to 74 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 300 to 360 days."
