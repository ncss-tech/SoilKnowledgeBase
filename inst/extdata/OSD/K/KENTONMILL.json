  "OVERVIEW": "The Kentonmill series consists of very shallow and shallow to bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt with eolian material influence. Kentonmill soils are on summits of lava flows and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
