  "OVERVIEW": "The Knoblaw series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments over loamy eolian deposits of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on a playa floors.  Slope range is 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
