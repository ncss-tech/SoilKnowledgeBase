    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 55 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 12 to 22 inches.  The solum ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid and the substratum ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 0 to 20 percent in the substratum. Cobble content ranges from 15 to 30 percent in the surface horizons and 0 to 10 percent in the rest of the pedon.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are dominantly cobbly silt loam, but the range includes cobbly very fine sandy loam and cobbly fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon where present has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value or 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 to 6.  The B horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Ex horizon and the E part of the (E/B)x horizon have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The B part of the 2(E/B)x horizon have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The B part of the 2(E/B)x and the 2Bt horizon have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR; value or 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E part is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  The B part is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  The E and Bt horizons may occur separately or in combination.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or gravelly analogs of the textures."

The Munising, Steuben, and McBride soils have coarser textured substrata and do not have cobbly surface horizons.  The Wabeno soils contain less clay in the substratum.  The Wakefield soils have fewer rock fragments in the solum and have a coarser textured substratum.  The Gogebic soils have coarser textured pedons.  The Champion soils do not have an argillic horizon and have a coarser textured substratum.  The Watton soils do not have spodic horizons and a fragipan."
