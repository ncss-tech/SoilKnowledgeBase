  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 30 inches and depth toe bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Tillite and rhythmite channers range from 5 to 80 percent in the individual horizons of a the solum and 35 to 95 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Annisquam, Berks, Blasdell, Brownsville, Calvin, Cardiff, Chenango, Dekalb, Greenlee, Hazelton, Highsplint, Itswoot, Lippitt, Manilus, Northcove, Oquaga, Parker, Peaks, Remote, Sylco, Tunkhannock, Warwick, Watt and Wyoming series in the same family.  The Annisquam soils formed in glacial material.  The Berks and Calvin soils have rock fragments dominated by shale, in addition the Berks soil has 5YR restricted to the lower Bw horizon.  The Blasdell, Chenango, Klone and Tunkhannock soils have water stratified material within the series control section.  Brownsville, Cardiff, and Greenlee have bedrock deeper than 40 inches.  Dekalb, Hazelton, Lippitt, Oquaga, Parker and Peaks soils have less than 18 percent clay in the series control section.   Highsplint soils formed in colluvium dominated by shale, sandstone, and siltstone. Itswoot soil has a solum more than 50 inches thick.  Manilus soil does not have detectable amounts of kaolinite. Northcove soil has a solum more than 35 inches thick.  Remote soils has clay loam textures in the fine earth fraction in the B horizon.  Sylco soils have rock fragments dominated by phyllite, slate, and metasandstone.  Warwick soil has sand or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction in the control section.  Watt soil has coarse fragments of graphitic schist that are easily crush to silty material.  Wyoming soil has 50 percent of the sand in the fine earth fraction of the B horizon is coarser than very fine sand."

The climate is temperate and humid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 47 inches."
