  "OVERVIEW": "The Kibin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine-loamy alluvium over outwash derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Kibin soils are on stream terraces on an intermontane basin.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
