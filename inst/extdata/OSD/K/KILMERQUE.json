  "OVERVIEW": "The Kilmerque series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks with an a mixture of ash and loess in the surface.  They are on mountains and have slopes of 1 to 80 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  The amount of rock fragments in the solum ranges from 0 to 25 percent, mostly of gravel size.  The soil is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam, ashy sandy loam, loam or sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist and dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.
