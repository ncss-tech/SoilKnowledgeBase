Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to an indurated duripan is 40 to over 60 inches. Rock fragments are subrounded. The particle-size control section has 35 to 65 percent rock fragments. It is medial loam or medial sandy loam and averages 15 to 27 percent clay. The solum is slightly or moderately acid. The base saturation is 35 to 60 percent in the solum. Thickness of andic soil properties is 40 to over 60 inches. The zone having andic soil properties consists of acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 3 to 5 percent, phosphate retention of 75 to 100 and 15 to 30 percent glass. The 15-bar water dry is 15 to 30 percent throughout. Acid oxalate extractable silica is 2 to 3 percent.\nThe A and AB horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It has 20 to 65 percent rock fragments with 20 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones. It has moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

The climate is humid with an annual precipitation of 30 to 50 inches. It occurs mainly in winter and spring. The mean January temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is less than 100 days. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent."
