  "OVERVIEW": "The Kyotesue series consists of very deep to deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial deposits. The rock fragments consist of andesite, scoriaceous cinders and basalt. Kyotesue soils are on volcanic cones and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to an indurated duripan is 40 to over 60 inches. Rock fragments are subrounded. The particle-size control section has 35 to 65 percent rock fragments. It is medial loam or medial sandy loam and averages 15 to 27 percent clay. The solum is slightly or moderately acid. The base saturation is 35 to 60 percent in the solum. Thickness of andic soil properties is 40 to over 60 inches. The zone having andic soil properties consists of acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 3 to 5 percent, phosphate retention of 75 to 100 and 15 to 30 percent glass. The 15-bar water dry is 15 to 30 percent throughout. Acid oxalate extractable silica is 2 to 3 percent.\nThe A and AB horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.
