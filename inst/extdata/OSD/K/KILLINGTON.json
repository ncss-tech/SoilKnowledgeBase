  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout the soil.  Some pedons are moderately acid near the bedrock.  Rock fragments are mostly rounded gravel and cobbles and make up 35 to 70 percent by volume of the particle size control section and range from 20 to 80 percent in individual horizons.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam or loam.  The spodic horizon is more than 8 inches thick.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.\nSome pedons have a Bh horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  It typically has a value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 2, but higher value and chroma are allowed.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, with value and chroma of approximately 3 or less.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, with value and chroma of 4 or more.\nBedrock is schist or gneiss."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:   The Canaan and Thorndike series are members of the same family.  Canaan soils range from gravelly fine sandy loam to very gravelly sandy loam throughout.  Rock fragments are dominantly granite.  Thorndike soils have higher silt content and rock fragments that are dominantly slate, shale and phyllite channers.  The Creasey, Hogback and Lyman soils are in related families.  The Creasey soils are derived principally from sandstone and are shallow to sandstone bedrock.  Hogback and Lyman soils are non-skeletal.  The Lyman soils also have a spodic horizon less than 8 inches thick."

The soils formed in loamy glacial till of Wisconsin age.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 40 degree to 44 degree F.  The frost free season ranges from about 60 to 120 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1. The classification is updated from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Lithic Haplorthods to Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Lithic Haplorthods.  Competing series section revised accordingly.\n2. The spodic horizon, especially the Bh and Bhs, exhibits some \"Thixotropic-like\" properties (i.e., smeariness, high organic carbon content, high effective clay percentage, high K value, and fragile nature that is easily damaged by foot or vehicular traffic)\n3. The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 1 inch (A horizon).\nb.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 1 to 17 inches (Bhs horizon: due to lack of Albic horizon, Bhs is assumed to meet criteria for spodic materials).\nc.  Lithic feature - bedrock at 17 inches from the soil surface.\nd.  Particle size control section from 10 inches to the lithic\ncontact is loamy-skeletal.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
