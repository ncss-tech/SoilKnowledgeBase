  "OVERVIEW": "The Kuro series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated shale or in colluvium over the shale. These soils are on hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
