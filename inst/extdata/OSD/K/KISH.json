  "OVERVIEW": "The Kish series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy glacial outwash or in a mantle of silty sediments and in the underlying calcareous loamy glacial outwash. These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
