  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches). The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) in thickness. Carbonates are in all parts of the fine-earth fraction between 25 to 51 cm (10 and 20 inches). Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout the series control section. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 30 percent. The particle-size control section has between 18 and 34 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent fine and coarser sand. The sand fraction is well sorted (poorly graded) throughout the series control section.\nThe Apk, Ap, Ak, or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bg or BCg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or sandy loam. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam, sandy loam, or silt loam with strata of coarser textures a common feature. Gravel content ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The calcium carbonate equivalent is generally higher in this section than in the upper two-thirds of the series control section."

Canisteo soils have a poorly sorted (well graded) sand fraction in the lower two-thirds of the series control section. Hetz soils have less than 410 mm (16 inches) of average annual precipitation and are at elevations above 1829 m (6,000 feet). Hooppole soils contain more than 75 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Jeffers soils have appreciable amounts of gypsum and have horizons with firm consistence in the series control section. Tilfer soils have a lithic contact at depths between 51 to 102 cm (20 and 40 inches)."
