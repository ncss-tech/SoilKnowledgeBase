  "OVERVIEW": "The Kerhayden series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on mountain slopes and on side slopes of terraces dissected into parallel ridges and valleys.  Slope ranges from 10 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is about 68 to 72 degrees F.  Depth to layers with visible secondary calcium carbonate is 6 to 15 inches.  Rock fragment content averages 5 to 30 percent and is mainly pebbles 2 millimeters to 3 inches in diameter.  In 6 out of 10 years the moisture control section is dry in some part more than one-half the time the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is above 41 degrees F.  However, in many years, the moisture control section is moist in some parts for 60 or more consecutive days when the soil temperature at 50 cm is above 48 degrees F.  Clay content of the particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is sandy loam, loam, gravelly loam, sandy clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam.  Below a depth of 30 inches are layers 6 to 15 inches thick with up to 70 percent rock fragments.  These layers are extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Content of fine or coarser sand is 40 percent or more."

Sinkson soils also receive more precipitation in the winter and early spring months.\nDelphill and Delridge soils have paralithic bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Poposhia soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower."

Slopes range from 10 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in stratified alluvium from mixed sources.  Strata are of variable thickness and texture and include conglomerate with fragments from volcanic rocks.  Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,400 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches."

Pinyon and juniper have been chained off many areas to improve grass production.  Principal vegetation in unchained areas is an overstory of pinyon and Rocky Mountain juniper and an understory of blue grama, western wheatgrass, mountain muhly, little bluestem, mountain mahogany, and other forbs and shrubs."
