  "BYREV": "Rev. JDP-SVV-RLT",
  "REVDATE": "09/2004",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenaga series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands formed in silty colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from decomposing post-Ordivician age mudstone.  These soils are on very gently to strongly sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
