  "REVDATE": "10/2013",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kana`a series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in tephra derived from volcanic rock. Kana`a soils are on cinder cones and lava fields. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. (6.7 degrees Celcius)",

These soils formed in tephra derived from volcanic rock. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches (457 to 559 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as snow December to February. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 to 7.7 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Blackash soils have a Ashy particle size and have less than 35 percent rock fragments or cinders in the control section.
