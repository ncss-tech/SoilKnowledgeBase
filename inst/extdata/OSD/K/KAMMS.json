  "OVERVIEW": "The Kamms series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium. The Kamms soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 309 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

As this site deteriorates blue grama, threadleaf sedge, threeawn and prickly pear cactus become the dominant vegetation."
