  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaito series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.  Kaito soils are on alluvial fans of hills.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
