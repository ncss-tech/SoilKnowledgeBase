Bluechief and Pagina soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Boreham, Hiko Springs, Kinan, McCutchen, Moffat, Nakai, Nakoy, Nolava, Nuahs, Riemod, Teabrush, and Trook soils are very deep. In addition, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, & 29) and have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kaito soils are on alluvial fans of hills.  They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Aneth soils are sandy, contain buried loamy horizons, and occur on adjacent eolian-mantled surfaces.  Claysprings soils are shallow and occur on adjacent backslopes of hills.   Piute soils are very shallow and occur on structural benches.  Sheppard soils are sandy and occur on stable dunes.  Tohatin soils are sandy, contain less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and occur on dissected fan terraces."
