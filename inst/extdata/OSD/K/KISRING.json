    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Kisring soils are usually saturated within 40 inches for at least one month or more during most years.\nThe mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 F.\nMineralogy is mixed but has been strongly influenced by both vitric ash pyroclastic materials and lime precipitated by evaporation of ground waters.\nDepth to the calcic horizons ranges from 12 to 24 inches.\nTexture of the control section is predominantly silty clay loam but may include strata of silt loam, loam and clay loam when mixed.\nControl section contains 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe soils are calcareous throughout and range from strongly to violently effervescent.\npH values become, with depth, and range from 9.6 to 8.6.\nColor of the A1 and C horizons includes hues of 10YR, values of 5.5 to 7.0 dry and 3 or 4 moist,\nChromas of 2 or 3.\nThey are either massive, or range in structure from weak very thin to thick platy, or weak or moderate very fine to medium granular.\nThese horizons are also strongly salt affected. The uncomfortable lacustrine materials (2C and 3C horizons)have colors including hues of 10YR or 2.5Y. values of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist,\nChromas of 2 or 3\nStructure ranges from weak or moderate, thin to thick platy or fine to coarse angular blocky, or the soil is massive.\nIron mottles, of reddish hues or high chromas, are present between 20 and 40 inches.\nUp to 30 percent 1/4 or 3/4 inch ovular and cylindrical durinodes occur in the Cqk horizons.\nThe Cq horizons contain 30 to 80 percent durinodes of similar size and shape.\nConsistence of the durinodes ranges from hard to extremely hard, firm to very firm, and brittle.\nA stony phase is recognized where the soil is adjacent to steep or very steep colluvial mountain slopes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING: Kisring soils are on smooth, nearly level lacustrine terraces with slope gradients of less than 2 percent. The soils developed in loamy alluvium superimposed over lacustrine materials both of which were derived from tuffs, andesite and basalt with a minor admixture from volcanic ash. The parent materials have been influenced by precipitation of lime due to evaporation of ground waters released by alluvial faulting. These soils are at elevation ranging from 4,500 to 5,000 feet in a cool, semiarid climate having mean annual precipitation of 6 to 8 inches that comes mostly as snow. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS: Kisring soils occur in the same general area as Couch, Lolak and Nevador soils. Couch soils have clay natric horizons and are well drained. Lolak soils have clay control sections and are poorly drained. Nevador soils have clay loam B2t horizons and are well drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The water table fluctuates between 3 to 5 feet during most of the year but drops 6 to 10 feet during the late summer and early fall.  The water table is a result of ground water release due to alluvial faulting. Permeability is slow and surface runoff is very slow."
