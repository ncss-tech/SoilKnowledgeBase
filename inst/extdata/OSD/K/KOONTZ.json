Erastra soils have argillic horizons with coarse sandy loam or sandy clay loam fine-earth texture, have significant amounts of medium or coarser sands, have rock fragments that are mainly stones and cobbles, and have paralithic material of weathered granodiorite in the series control section.  Roloc soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the control section.  Tulecan soils are moist 10 to 20 days in the summer, have sandy clay loam or coarse sandy loam argillic horizons and have rock fragments that are mainly fine gravel (2 to 5 mm in diameter).  Ubehebe soils are calcareous in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Koontz soils are on hills and mountains and typically occur on shoulder or backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from soft metavolcanic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,463 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, which comes mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.   The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
