The maximum clay content for any subhorizon is 44 percent.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches thick.\nThe A horizon ranges from 12 to 20 inches thick and is black (N 2/0 or 10YR 2/1).  It is silty clay loam or silty clay and ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe BA horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1.  Higher values or higher chromas occur as mottles.\nThe Bg horizon ranges in hue from 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The upper part of the Bg horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay, and the lower part is silty clay loam.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are common or many and have hues as red as 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chromas of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Secondary carbonates are in some pedons."

Chequest soils have more acid sola and contain more sand.  Lanyon soils have thinner sola and typically have free carbonates at depths of 12 to 20 inches.  Marna soils have more sand throughout.  Streator soils contain more clay in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon.  Waldorf soils average 40 to 50 percent clay in the control section.  Taintor soils have an argillic horizon."

The somewhat poorly drained Mahaska soils are on convex sideslopes at a lower elevation or on slight rises on the broad upland flats.  The moderately well drained Nira and Otley soils are at slightly lower elevations on convex summits of interfluves and side slopes.  The Sperry soils are in depressions within the broad areas of Kalona soils.  The Taintor soils are on similar landscape positions.  Where Kalona and Taintor soils are next to each other on the landscape, the Kalona soils are in the middle part of the divide, and Taintor soils are along the edges."
