  "OVERVIEW": "The Kahanui series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from weathered from andesite.  Kahanui soils are on mountain ridges and have slopes of 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 1778 millimeters (70 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C. (65 degrees F.)",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Ironstone concretions and fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the A horizon.  In some pedons the ironstone concretions form a slaglike mass to depths of up to 91 centimeters (3 feet).  The discontinuous ironstone sheet is at a depth of 51 to 64 centimeters (20 to 25 inches) and ranges from slightly hard to very hard and is 0.3 to 2.50 centimeters (1/8 to 1 inch) or more in thickness.  In depressions it is hard or very hard, continuous and impermeable to roots and water.  Hard bedrock is at a depth of 1.5 to more than 2.5 meters (5 to more than 8 feet).  The mean annual soil temperature is about 18 degrees C. (65 degrees F.)\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 1 or 3 dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 through 6 moist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum from weathered from andesite.  The mean annual rainfall is 1,524 to 2,032 millimeters (60 to 80 inches).  Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.  Fog and cloud cover are common during the winter.  On the island of Lanai annual rainfall is only 890 millimeters (35 inches), but the effective rainfall is 1,524 to 2,032 millimeters (60 to 80 inches) because of frequent fog and cloud cover.  The mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C. (65 degrees F.); average January temperature is about 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F.); and the average July temperature is about 19 degrees C. (67 degrees F.)"
