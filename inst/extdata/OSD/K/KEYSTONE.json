  "OVERVIEW": "The Keystone series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash on plains, hillslopes, kames, and moraines at elevations of near sea level to 60 meters. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

All of these soils are dry in the moisture control section less than 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. In addition, Birdsview soils can have a frost free period of less than 200 days and mean annual soil temperature less than 10 degrees C. Greenwater soils have 5 to 25 percent volcanic ash and pumice in the control section. Pilchuck soils lack a B horizon, have a chroma of 2 or less throughout the control section, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth."

Whidbey and Keystone soils are in complex on similar landscape positions. Whidbey soils are in a loamy-skeletal family and are underlain by dense glacial till at a depth of 20 to 40 cm."
