All of these soils are dry in the moisture control section less than 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. In addition, Birdsview soils can have a frost free period of less than 200 days and mean annual soil temperature less than 10 degrees C. Greenwater soils have 5 to 25 percent volcanic ash and pumice in the control section. Pilchuck soils lack a B horizon, have a chroma of 2 or less throughout the control section, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth."

Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 457 to 762 mm most of which falls as rain in the late fall, winter and early spring. Mean annual temperature is about 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."

Bow soils are in a fine family and have an argillic horizon. Laconner soils are sandy-skeletal and have a densic contact at 25 to 40 cm. Whidbey and Keystone soils are in complex on similar landscape positions. Whidbey soils are in a loamy-skeletal family and are underlain by dense glacial till at a depth of 20 to 40 cm."
