  "OVERVIEW": "The Kirbyville series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid-Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Kirbyville soils were formerly included with the Caddo and Thage soils.  Classification and drainage class changed 12/97 based on data collected from typifying pedon in Hardin County, TX.  Soil moisture monitoring indicates these soils to have saturation, for several weeks during January to March, with no reduction and qualify for a Oxyaquic subgroup. Typifying pedon redescribed 12/97.  The classification was updated from Plinthic Paleudults to Oxyaquic Paleudults in May 1999 due to a change in soil taxonomy. Series description was updated in July 2011 as part of the update of MLRA 152B.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:\nOchric epipedon--0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in) (A and E horizon).\nArgillic horizon--46 to 203 cm (18 to 80 in) (Bt/E, Btcv/E, Btv/Eg1, Btv/Eg2, Btv/Eg3 horizons).\nGlossic horizon--46 to 203 cm (18 to 80 inch (Bt/E, Btcv/E, Btv/Eg1, Btv/Eg2, Btv/Eg3 horizons).\nSaturated from 46 to 89 cm (16 to 39 in) for 30 or more cumulative days in normal years. (Bt/E horizon)\nPlinthite--5 percent or more of some part of the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Texas A&M University data from Hardin County, TX on pedon S96TX-199-001 and on pedon S00TX-457-003 from Tyler County, TX.\nNSSL data on pedon number 07N0378 (S06TX-457-001) from Tyler County, TX.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
