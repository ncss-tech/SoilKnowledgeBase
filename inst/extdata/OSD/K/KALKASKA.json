Liminga soils have more than 50 percent fine sand in the sand fraction throughout the series control section. Pence soils have a loamy mantle 25 to 50 centimeters thick and average more than 10 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section.

The moderately well drained Halfaday, somewhat poorly drained Au Gres, and poorly and very poorly drained Deford soils form a common drainage sequence with the Kalkaska soils. The somewhat excessively drained East Lake and poorly and very poorly drained Roscommon soils are common associates on outwash plains. The East Lake soils are on similar landform positions, have more than 10 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section and have moist colors of value or chroma greater than 3 in the upper part of the spodic horizon. Roscommon soils are in depressions and do not have a spodic horizon. The excessively drained Rubicon soils are common associates on moraines. Rubicon soils are on similar landform positions and have moist colors of value or chroma greater than 3 in the upper part of the spodic horizon."
