  "OVERVIEW": "The Kusalslough series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks.  Kusalslough soils are on the margins of flood plains and flood basins.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, (559 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (17 degrees C).",
