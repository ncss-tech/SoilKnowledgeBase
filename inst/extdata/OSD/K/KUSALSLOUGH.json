These flood deposits predominantly occur from the confluences of Mud Creek, Big Chico Creek, and the Sacramento River, in the vicinity of Kusalslough Slough.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium weathered from mixed rocks.  Elevation is 120 to 140 feet, (37 to 43 m).  Mean annual precipitation is 21 to 22 inches, (533 to 559 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 61 to 62 degrees F, (16 to 17 degrees C).  Frost free season is 240 to 250 days."
