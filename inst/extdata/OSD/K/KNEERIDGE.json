  "OVERVIEW": "The Kneeridge series consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or till derived from andesite and andesitic lahar. The Kneeridge soils are on footslopes and side slopes of glaciated valleys in the mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1194 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
