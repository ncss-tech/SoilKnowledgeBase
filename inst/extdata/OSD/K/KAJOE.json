Bluepoint soils have control sections that are loamy fine sand or fine sand. Brazito, University and Yturbide soils are moist for more than 20 cumulative days in the summer. Cajon soils are moist for short periods in the winter and spring and are dry from summer to mid-fall. Maynard Lake soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 62 degrees F. and have more than 20 percent volcanic ash and pumice in the control section. Moapa soils are moderately deep to sandstone. Pintura and Toquop soils have control sections that are fine sand."
