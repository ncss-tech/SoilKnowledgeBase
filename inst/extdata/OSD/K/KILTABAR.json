  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Surface accumulations of salts are common.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains from 18 to 35 percent clay.  Coarse fragment content is typically 0 to 10 percent pebbles throughout but may range to 20 percent in the C horizon when averaged.  E.C. ranges from 28 to 90 mmhos and salt content from 2 to 6 percent in the salic horizon.  Gypsum content ranges from 5 to 25 percent visible crystals in the gypsic horizon.  Depth to water table is variable but is present within three feet of the surface for one month or more in most years.\nThe Azy and Az horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bzy horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry and moist, and chroma 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is commonly silty clay loam or clay loam, but the range includes sandy clay loam and loam.  It is moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is commonly clay loam or silty clay loam, but some pedons have thin strata of gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam below 40 inches.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent with hummocky microrelief common.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Elevation is 6,800 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 85 to 110 days."
