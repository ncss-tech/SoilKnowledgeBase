    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 52 to 56 degrees F for 120 to 135 consecutive days. These soils have a soil temperature above 41 degrees F for about 210 days annually. The soils are usually dry between depths of 12 to 35 inches or to the duripan, if shallower. Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand. Lime-silica fragments average 5 to 25 percent and rock fragments range up to 15 percent. Thin sandy loam lenses occur immediately above the duripan in some pedons."
