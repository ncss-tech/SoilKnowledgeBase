  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Keeter series consists of moderately deep over noncemented sandstone bedrock, well drained, moderately slowly permeable, loamy soils that formed in loamy residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone bedrock of Cretaceous age. These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils occur on crests of ridges on hills. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
