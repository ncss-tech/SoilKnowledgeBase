The color requirements for the mollic intergrade are met by mixing the top 18 cm of the soil.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eleventh edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
