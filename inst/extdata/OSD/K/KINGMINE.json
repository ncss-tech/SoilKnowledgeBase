  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingmine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium weathered primarily from sandstone and shale.  Kingmine soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 72 cm, and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C.",
