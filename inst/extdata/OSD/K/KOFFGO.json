Client assigned lab number S94ID-043-004.\nProject file number: 95P 27. Lab assigned number: Pedon 95P 151. Samples: 95P 1035-1038.\nKoffgo soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
