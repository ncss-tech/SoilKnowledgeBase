  "STATES": "ID,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Koffgo series consists of very deep, well drained soils on canyonsides, tablelands, plateaus, hills and mountain slopes.  They formed in volcanic ash over slope alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. Permeability in the surface is moderate and moderately rapid in the subsoil and substratum.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified."
