  "OVERVIEW": "The Kindred series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate or moderately slow.  These soils are on low flats and concave swales on glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",
