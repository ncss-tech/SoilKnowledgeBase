  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to greater than 80 inches, and depth to the B/E horizon ranges from 14 to 39 inches.  Some pedons contain fragments of sandstone in the solum, or contain fragments of crystalline rocks throughout.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the surface layers, and from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the subsoil and substratum. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 25 throughout the soil. Typically stones cover from less than .01 percent of the surface to 0.1 percent of the surface.\nSome pedons have an A horizon.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. Weakly cemented ortstein is in the Bhs and Bs1 horizons of some pedons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. In some pedons individual subhorizons of the Bhs or Bs horizons may be sandy loam, however, the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages to sandy.\nThe E part of the B/E horizon is in the form of coatings on the faces of peds of Bt part, but in the E and Bt horizon the two kinds of material are in alternate bands. In the E and Bt horizon, the Bt bands range from 1/8 to 2 inches thick and have a cumulative thickness of greater than 6 inches within a depth of 80 inches. Some pedons have E, Bt, or E/B horizons.\nThe E part of these horizons has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. The clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 8 to 15 percent. The B/E horizon exhibits some characteristics of a fragipan; it is firm when moist and hard when dry and has some brittleness. Reaction of the E/B, E and Bt, E, Bt, or B/E horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a C horizon. The C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  The C horizon ranges from uniform loamy sand to water worked, interbedded sand and loamy sand that contains some bands or pockets of sandy loam.  Gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures are allowed. It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Leelanau, Mancelona, and Melita and Southwells series.  Leelanau and Mancelona soils contain free carbonates within depths of 60 inches and do not have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR in the substratum. Melita soils formed in 40 to 60 inches of sand and contain 18 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Southwells soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature from about 41 to 44 degrees F."
