  "OVERVIEW": "The Kedron series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly, and moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium or glacial till from reddish shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Permeability is slow.  Mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout where unlimed.  Depth to low chroma mottles ranges from 12 to 30 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA and Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Textures range from silt loam to clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.

Buchanan soils do not have hue of 5YR or redder in B2 horizons.  Raritan soils have rounded fragments and unconforming C horizon of stratified sand, silt, and gravel.  Albrights soils have more than 35 percent base saturation.  Leck Kill soils do not have Bx horizon and mottles.  Meckesville soils do not have mottles with chroma of two or less within 30 inches.  Wellsboro soils do not have Bt horizons."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 13 inches (Ap and BA horizons).\n2.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 13 to 22 inches (Bt horizon).\n3.  Fragipan - the zone from 22 to 65 inches (Btx1 and Btx2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The Kedron series included some soils previously identified as Albrights that have low base saturation.  Lab data from six samples in Pennsylvania has considerably less than 35 percent base saturation.  Laboratory data S72-PA-24-5 are from typifying pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
