  "OVERVIEW": "The Klingmore series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying glacial till. These soils are on slightly convex side slopes, head slopes and nose slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 83 centimeters (33 inches).",
