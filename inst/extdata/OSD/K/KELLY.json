Ott and Sycoline soils are on similar landscape positions. Ott soils are moderately deep and well drained. Sycoline soils are moderately deep and moderately well drained. Catlett soils are on steeper side slopes and are shallow and well drained."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. Classification and type location changed to Prince William County, Virginia 1981. Type location moved back to Culpeper County, Virginia in 2003. On the 1986 OSD, authors were RSW, JHE, and DDR. RRD changed it to ACB, RRD in 1997. This 2003 revision by JHS-MAV removed statements about forming partly in periglacially transported materials.\n2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (A horizon).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 37 inches (Bt horizons).\nc. Lithic contact - at 47 inches (R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab date is available.  Kelly soils normally have high amounts of exchangeable Mg, and Mg to Ca rations of greater than 1:1.  Magnesium toxicity may be a limiting factor in use and management of these soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
