  "REVDATE": "04/2013",
  "STATES": "NY,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanona series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands. The soils formed in till derived from soft shale, and some siltstone. They are on broad hilltops, hillsides and till plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the mineral surface and subsurface and moderately high to low in the subsoil and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Reaction commonly ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the control section but the range includes very strongly acid in some pedons. Rock fragments, mainly shale fragments range from 5 to 35 percent in the textural control section and up to 50 percent below 40 inches.\nUndisturbed soils have A horizons with hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 2 or 3, and chromas of 1 or 2. The Ap horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3, or 4 and chromas of 1 or 2. Textures are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular or fine subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, values of 4 through 6, and chromas of 0 through 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky or thin or medium platy. Consistence is friable or firm.\nSome pedons may have a BA horizon with colors and textures and structures similar to the A and B horizons.\nThe Bw horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 5Y, values of 4 through 6, and chromas 2 through 8 with few to many, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is heavy silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is moderate or strong, fine to coarse blocky, or blocky within moderate or strong, medium or coarse prisms. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nSome pedons may have a BC or CB horizon, with hues of 7.5 YR through 5Y, values of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Texture ranges are clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is moderate or strong, medium or coarse blocky, or blocky within moderate or strong, medium or coarse prisms. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe C horizons have hues of 10YR through 5Y, values of 3 through 6, and chromas of 1 through 4. Textures range are clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or thick plate like divisions, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil has been considered a \"deep Allis\". It differs from Allis and the similar Hornell soils in being deep to bedrock and in a nonacid family. The classification is provisional to an acid family.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n(2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 30 inches (Bw horizons).\n(3) Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime, and evidence of wetness that includes 2 chroma on all ped faces and redox features in the zone from 12 to 30 inches (Bw horizon)."
