  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 41 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 40 inches. Reaction commonly ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the control section but the range includes very strongly acid in some pedons. Rock fragments, mainly shale fragments range from 5 to 35 percent in the textural control section and up to 50 percent below 40 inches.\nUndisturbed soils have A horizons with hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 2 or 3, and chromas of 1 or 2. The Ap horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3, or 4 and chromas of 1 or 2. Textures are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular or fine subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, values of 4 through 6, and chromas of 0 through 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky or thin or medium platy. Consistence is friable or firm.\nSome pedons may have a BA horizon with colors and textures and structures similar to the A and B horizons.\nThe Bw horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 5Y, values of 4 through 6, and chromas 2 through 8 with few to many, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is heavy silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is moderate or strong, fine to coarse blocky, or blocky within moderate or strong, medium or coarse prisms. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nSome pedons may have a BC or CB horizon, with hues of 7.5 YR through 5Y, values of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Texture ranges are clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is moderate or strong, medium or coarse blocky, or blocky within moderate or strong, medium or coarse prisms. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe C horizons have hues of 10YR through 5Y, values of 3 through 6, and chromas of 1 through 4. Textures range are clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or thick plate like divisions, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Allis, Fremont, Hornell, Rhinebeck, and Remsen series are in related families. Allis and Hornell soils have shale bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Fremont soils have fine-loamy textural control sections. Rhinebeck and Remsen soils have argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kanona soils occupy the tops and sides of glaciated hills and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils developed in fine textured till with a high component of shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 52 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation, from 35 to 45 inches; mean frost-free period, from 120 to 160 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Allis and Hornell soils are associates where the till mantle is thinner than in Kanona. Erie, Fremont, Langford, Mardin, and Volusia soils are developed in deep, coarser textured till on similar landforms."

An apparent seasonal high water table is from 0.5 to 1.5 feet from November to May of normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the mineral surface and subsurface and moderately high to low in the subsoil and substratum."

Most of the acreage of this soil has remained in, or is idle and reverting to, woodland. Native woody vegetation is red and sugar maple, white ash, black cherry, red oak, and white pine."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil has been considered a \"deep Allis\". It differs from Allis and the similar Hornell soils in being deep to bedrock and in a nonacid family. The classification is provisional to an acid family.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n(2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 30 inches (Bw horizons).\n(3) Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime, and evidence of wetness that includes 2 chroma on all ped faces and redox features in the zone from 12 to 30 inches (Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
