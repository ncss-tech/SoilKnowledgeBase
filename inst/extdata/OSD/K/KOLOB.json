They are continually moist for 35 to 45 days during the summer months and only 45 to 60 days during the winter and early spring.  The soil moisture regime is typic ustic.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 14 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The depth to calcium carbonate is more than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It ranges from gravelly clay loam or very cobbly clay with estimated 35 to 50 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 50 percent in the upper 4 to 18 inches and 40 to 90 percent in the lower part of the horizon.\nA C horizon is present in some pedons."
