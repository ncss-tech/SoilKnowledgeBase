Consolidated bedrock is at depths of 152 cm (5 feet) or more. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part of the series control section and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Typically the lower half of the series control section contains carbonates.\nThe Ap, A, or AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt, Bw, 2Bt, 2Bw, or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some faint redoximorphic features are in the lower part of some pedons. It is loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the upper part, and very cobbly or cobbly loam, or very cobbly or cobbly sandy loam in the lower part. Content of cobbles ranges from 0 to 60 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.
