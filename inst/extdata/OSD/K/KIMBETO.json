Kimbeto soils formed in eolian material, alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from Cretaceous sandstone.  A very deep phase also formed in alluvium, and residuum derived from shale and quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free is 140 to 160 days."

Nageezi soils are coarse-loamy, lack natric horizons and occur on adjacent high stream terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 10 inches.  (A and Bw horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 10 to 18 inches (2Btkn horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from about 18 to 29 inches.  (2Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - the presence of soft sandstone bedrock at about 42 inches.\nThe classification was changed from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Haplic Natrargids to Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Calciargids in 2004 because the natric horizon was inconsistent in this series and because the sodium was too deep in the profile to meet the natric criteria. The 3BCkn horizon is too deep in the typical profile for the pedon to have a natric horizon. This horizon fails criterion 2.a. of the required characteristics.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter.  Salinity values were determined on six pedons including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.  The values for sodium adsorption ratio where bracketed around values obtained from lab data of the series type location, which was analyzed at the BIA soils laboratory in Gallup, NM. In addition to SAR, the type location has had determination of particle size distribution, pH of paste, EC (mmhos/cm) and calcium carbonate equivalent.  The series type location was also reference sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon S85NM-045-005.  Another pedon of the Kimbeto series was also sampled for full characterization by the NSSL as pedon S86NM-045-015.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
