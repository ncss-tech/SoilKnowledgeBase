  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 34 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock, typically rippable shale and siltstone, is at depths greater than 60 inches but is commonly within a depth of 100 inches. Rock fragments, dominantly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the solum, and from 10 to 60 percent in the substratum. Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw and/or BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have redoximorphic in the lower part of the B horizon. Structure is subangular or angular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is similar to the C horizon. In some pedons this horizon may have redoximorphic features. Structure is subangular blocky or platy. Consistence ranges from friable to very firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Textures include loam, silt loam, silty clay loam and clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has prismatic or platy structure, or the material is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Carrollton series are in the same family. Carrollton soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Edneytown, Gladstone, Millstone, Pigeonroost, Sauratown, Shelocta and Syenite soils are similar soils with  mesic temperature regimes. In addition, Edneytown and Gladstone soils formed in residuum from granitic gneiss, Millstone soils formed in loamy alluvium, Shelocta soils have a solum at depths greater than 40 inches, and Syenite soils developed from loamy residuum from granite. Pigeonroost and Sauratown soils are moderately deep to metamorphic rock. Gilpin, Dekalb, Muskingum, Rayne, and Allegheny series are in related families, but all of these soils have mesic temperature regimes. In addition, Gilpin, Dekalb, and Muskingum all have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Also in a related family is the Onoville series. Onoville soils have redoximorphic depletions in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kinzua soils are on nearly level to very steep ridgetops, hillsides and valley sides. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium or residuum weathered from interbedded shale, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation is from 30 to 45 inches; and the growing season ranges from 90 to 120 days. These soils are mostly at elevations of 1800 to 2400 feet."

The Shongo, Buchanan, Eldred, Valois, Chautauqua, Schuyler, and Carrollton soils are on associated landscapes. The Shongo, Buchanan, and Eldred soils have redoximorphic features in the subsoil; in addition Buchanan and Shongo have fragipans. Valois, Chautauqua and Schuyler soils formed in glacial till at lower elevations. The competing Carrollton soils are on nearby ridgecrests, which have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
