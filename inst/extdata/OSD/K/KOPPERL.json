  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness to fractured hard limestone ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where moist values and chromas are less than 3.5, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  The texture is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.  Pebbles range from 20 to 50 percent by volume and consist mostly of rounded chert.  The A horizon ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Few or common mottles of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) or brown (10YR 5/3) are present in the Bt2 horizon of most pedons.  The Bt1 horizon is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.  The Bt2 horizon is gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay, or very gravelly clay.  The clay content of the fine earth fraction of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 18 to 35 percent.  Coarse fragments comprise 35 to 50 percent of the  control section.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon is generally mottled in colors of brown, strong brown, light brown, reddish yellow or reddish brown.  It is clay or gravelly clay and ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline and is calcareous in the lower part of some pedons.\nThe 2R layer is white, hard limestone that is fractured in the upper 10 to 30 inches and massive below."

Brisco, Dina and Rumple soils have mollic epipedons and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Click soils have mixed mineralogy and have a lithic contact to fractured granite.  Nocken and Riesel soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kopperl soils are on old nearly level to gently sloping high stream terraces.  In places these terraces occur as remnants on limestone ridges.  The soil formed in gravelly stream deposits laid down over limestone of Lower Cretaceous age.  Slope ranges from 0 to about 3 percent but is mainly about l percent.  Climate is moist subhumid.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 35 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 64 to 69 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 48 to 62."
