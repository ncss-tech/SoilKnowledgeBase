  "OVERVIEW": "The Kirkendall series consists of very deep, well or moderately well drained soils formed in silty alluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rock types. They are occur on flood plains at elevations of 20 to 750 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54  degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for a period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four month period following during the summer solstice in most years. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Faint redox concentrations occur below a depth of 20 inches in some pedons with common to many distinct redox concentrations typically found below 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Lenses of coarser textured material are in some pedons. Hue is 10YR to 7.5YR. The particle-size control section has 15 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Soil reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.\nThe AB horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It has with 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 orto 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is commonly silt loam, but ranges to loam and silty clay loam. It has 15 to 35 percent clay."

Eilertsen, Treharne, and Zyzzug soils are on low stream terraces. Eilertsen soils have an argillic horizon and are well drained. Nekoma soils are coarse-loamy. Quosatana, Wasson, and Zyzzug soils have an aquic moisture regime and are poorly drained. Treharne soils have an argillic horizon and are moderately well drained."
