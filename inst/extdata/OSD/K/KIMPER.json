  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches and depth to bedrock ranges from 48 to 100 inches or more. Rock fragments, mostly sandstone channers, range from 5 to 60 percent in individual horizons, but the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent. Coverage of surface stones ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the A horizon and from very strongly to moderately acid in the B and C horizon.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 4, but to a depth of 7 inches after mixing have value, moist, of 3 or less, dry, 5 or less. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, and value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Some pedons have lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, yellow, black, red or gray in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Some pedons are variegated without dominant hue or chroma. Other pedons have thin Cr horizons directly overlying bedrock.\nBedrock is unweathered sandstone, siltstone or shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kimper soils are mostly in coves and on foot slopes and benches of mountain sides with cool aspects. Slopes range from 5 to 95 percent, but are dominantly 30 to 75 percent. Kimper soils formed in loamy colluvium moved downslope from soils weathered from Pennsylvanian aged strata dominated by strongly acid to neutral sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Elevation ranges from 800 to 4,000 feet and local relief differences ranges from 600 to 2,500 feet. Near the type location, annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F with a mean of 56 degrees. Annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 49 inches with a mean of about 43 inches."

Gilpin, Jefferson, Latham, Pineville, Rayne and Shelocta soils have argillic horizons. Cutshin and Guyandotte soils have umbric epipedons. Sharondale soils have mollic epipedons. Berks, Cloverlick, Dekalb, Guyandotte, Handshoe, Highsplint and Sharondale soils are loamy-skeletal. Fedscreek and Marrowbone soils are coarse-loamy. Latham soils are fine. Berks, Dekalb, Gilpin, Latham, Marrowbone and Muskingum soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Jefferson soils have siliceous mineralogy."
