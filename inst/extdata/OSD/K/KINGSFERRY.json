  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingsferry series consists of very deep very poorly drained sandy soils that have a Bh horizon at a depth of 30 to 50 inches. They formed in thick deposits of sandy marine sediments. They are on nearly level, broad low flats on the flatwoods. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness exceeds 80 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout. Depth to the spodic horizon is 30 to 50 inches. Texture is sand or fine sand in all horizons except the Bh horizon which includes loamy fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bh horizon hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. It is very friable to friable in the upper part and firm to very firm in the lower part. The lower part of the Bh horizon is weakly cemented in more than one-half of the horizon in each pedon. Depth to the firm or very firm weakly cemented Bh horizon is greater than 60 inches.\nSome pedons have a bisequem of Bh, E' and B'h horizons with similar colors and textures of the overlying horizons."
