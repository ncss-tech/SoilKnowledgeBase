    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kettling soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on terraces and floodplains of river valley bottoms at elevations from 300 to 800 meters.  They formed in alluvium from meandering rivers and are typically found where slower moving water deposited flood sediments.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 1780 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 9 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
