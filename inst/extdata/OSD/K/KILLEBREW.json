  "OVERVIEW": "The Killebrew series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Killebrew soils are in valleys and on drift plains and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Mitchellbay soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days, and have an E horizon which has moderate medium prismatic structure, bulk density of less than 1.8 g/cm3, and a moderately hard dry rupture resistance. Quatama soils do not have redoximorphic features above 38 cm, an albic horizon, or a densic contact. Stockel soils do not have an albic horizon or a densic contact. The Wellsdale series has similar classification but an active cation-exchange activity class. Wellsdale soils do not have redoximorphic features above 50 cm, an albic horizon, or a densic contact."
