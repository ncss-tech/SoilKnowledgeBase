Mitchellbay soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days, and have an E horizon which has moderate medium prismatic structure, bulk density of less than 1.8 g/cm3, and a moderately hard dry rupture resistance. Quatama soils do not have redoximorphic features above 38 cm, an albic horizon, or a densic contact. Stockel soils do not have an albic horizon or a densic contact. The Wellsdale series has similar classification but an active cation-exchange activity class. Wellsdale soils do not have redoximorphic features above 50 cm, an albic horizon, or a densic contact."

These soils formed in glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are 0 to 158 m. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 457 to 762 mm. The average annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."
