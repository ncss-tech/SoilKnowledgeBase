  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mineral solum thickness ranges from 38 to 99 cm.  Rock fragments in the form of gravel, channers, cobbles and stones range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum, and 5 to 20 percent in the substratum. Parachanners range from 0 to 10 percent in the subsoil and 5 to 15 percent in the substratum. Very friable remnants of highly weathered fine and medium pebble-sized pelitic limestone are present in some pedons in the subsoil and in the substratum. These remnants are intact within the profile but are easily crushed when rubbed between the fingers. Reaction in unlimed areas is strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface, strongly acid to neutral in the subsoil, and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum. Average clay content in the particle size control section is 8 to 18 percent. Residuum in the form of highly fractured bedrock (2Cr horizons) or non-cemented saprolite (2C horizon), where present, is at a depth of 100 cm or more. Depth to lithic contact in unweathered bedrock (2R horizon) is 150 cm or more.\nForested areas may have an Oe horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.  Forested sites that were once cropped, hayed and/or pastured may display former plow layers in the A horizon below an O horizon. An Ap horizon with textures and colors similar to the A horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 5 . 5. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of  2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe 2Cr and/or 2C horizons, when present, are typically highly fractured limestone-interbedded phyllite dipped about 20 degrees from horizontal."

The soils formed in glacial till derived from limestone-interbedded phyllite, calcareous metasiltstone, and pelitic limestone. Residuum in the form of fractured bedrock or highly weathered saprolite sometimes underlies the till. Elevations are 50 to 230 m. The mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1132 mm. The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 115 to 155 days."

Sebasticook soils are well drained and deep to bedrock, and are on linear to slightly convex summits and side slopes. Wassookeag soils are moderately well drained and on linear to slightly concave side slopes. Corinna soils are somewhat excessively drained and shallow to bedrock, and are on slightly convex summits and shoulders. Penobscot soils are well drained and moderately deep to bedrock, and are on linear to slightly convex summits and side slopes.  The moderately well drained Boothbay, the somewhat poorly drained Pushaw, and the poorly drained Swanville soils formed in very deep glaciomarine or glaciolacustrine sediments, and are on adjacent lake plains or marine terraces at slightly lower elevations. The very deep moderately well drained Chesuncook soils, very deep somewhat poorly drained Telos soils, and very deep poorly drained Monarda soils formed in lodgment till, and are on side slopes, foot slopes and toe slopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series name  is taken from Kenduskeag Stream, a major tributary to the Penobscot River in Southern Penobscot County, Maine. This soil is part of a proposed catena of soils that include Wassookeag, Sebasticook, Penobscot, and Corinna. They developed in till that is shallow to very deep to calcareous metamorphic bedrock of the Waterville and Sangerville Formations. In comparison to other till soils on ground moraines in the region they have higher base saturation, nutrient availability, water-holding capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Former plow layers in an A horizon below an O horizon in woodland are not uncommon in the series' physiographic area.  It is recognized that some pedons characterized for series development have isotic mineralogy, and also that in certain instances densic materials are present 50 cm or more below the mineral soil surface.\nFeatures similar to those described as remnants of highly weathered pelitic limestone, were historically described as \"limestone ghosts\" in some places.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric  epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 20 cm (A horizon ).\n2. Cambic horizon - from a depth of 20 to 78 cm (Bw horizon).\n3. Redox depletions with chroma 2 or less - from 20 to 165 cm.\nPedon originally identified as S10ME019002.Kenduskeag.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Primary characterization data from pedon 11N8705 (S19ME019002) , samples 11N09346 to 11N09350 from Penobscot County, Maine, is available from Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE, 06/2010 .\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
