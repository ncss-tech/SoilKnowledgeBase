    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  The organic carbon content ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the mineral soil surface and/or there is an irregular decrease in organic carbon content within a depth of 10 to 50 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  Some pedons have buried A horizons.  They are within a depth of 30 to 60 inches of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox concentrations in shades of brown range from none to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part.  Some pedons have value of 5 with chroma of 2 or 3.  Redox concentrations, consisting of  masses, in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common.  The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Redox features, consisting of masses, range from none to common in shades of gray, brown, or yellow.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Thin discontinuous bedding planes of loamy, clayey, and/or sandy materials range from few to common in some pedons.  However, they make up less than 30 percent of any subhorizon.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.  Redox features, consisting of masses, range from none to common in shades of brown or gray.  The reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."
