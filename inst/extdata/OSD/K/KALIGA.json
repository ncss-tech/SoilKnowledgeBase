    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil reaction of the Oa horizons is less than 4.5 0.01M CaC12.  Thickness of the organic material ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  Weighted clay content of the upper 12 inches of the C horizons within the 51-inch control section is less than 35 percent. Reaction of the C horizons ranges from very strongly acid to neutral and base saturation is more than 35 percent.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 3.  The fiber content, after rubbing, is less than 17 percent of the soil volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 2 to 5 and chroma 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 5. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray and yellow range from none to common.  Texture ranges from loamy sand to clay."

All of these soils except the Hontoon, Samsula, and Tomoka soils are mineral. Basinger, Placid, and Pompano soils are sandy to depths of 80 inches or more.  Chobee soils have argillic horizons within depths of 20 inches, Delray soils between depths of 40 to 80 inches, and Floridana soils between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Riviera soils have glossic properties.  Nittaw soils have histic epipedons.  Hontoon soils have organic layers to depths of 51 inches or more."
