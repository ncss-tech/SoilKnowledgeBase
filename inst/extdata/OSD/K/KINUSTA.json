    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kinusta soils are on backslopes of escarpments and backslopes between structural benches.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Jurassic and Triassic siltstone, mudstone, limestone, and sandstone.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with about half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Beclabito soils are sodic, have calcic horizons, and occur on adjacent summits of structural benches, and on footslopes.  Blanding soils are fine-silty, very deep, and occur on eolian-mantled fan terraces and toeslopes.  Eslendo soils are 7.5YR and browner in color, are higher in clay, and occur on adjacent backslopes.  Rizno soils are very shallow and occur on dipslopes of cuestas and summits of structural benches."
