  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kellygulch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from granite bedrock. These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hills, ridges, divides, mountains, and escarpments. Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
