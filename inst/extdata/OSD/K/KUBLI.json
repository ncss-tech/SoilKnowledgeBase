    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but dry throughout between 4 to 12 inches for 70 to 100 consecutive days in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 25 to 35 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Coarse sand makes up a large porportion of the sand fraction.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 5 dry, chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  Faint mottles are common in the lower part.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 6 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay."

The Barron and Central Points soils are somewhat excessively drained and lack mottles and clayey textures.  Medford soils have silty clay loam in the B horizons and lack mottles with chromas of 2 above 30 inches.  Cove soils are fine textured throughout, mottled and chroma of 2 or less throughout the sola.  Shefflein soils are fine-loamy."
