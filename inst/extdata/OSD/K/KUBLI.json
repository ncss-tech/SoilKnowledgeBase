  "OVERVIEW": "The Kubli series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from granitic materials over older clayey alluvium.  They are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 25 to 35 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Coarse sand makes up a large porportion of the sand fraction.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 5 dry, chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  Faint mottles are common in the lower part.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 6 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay."
