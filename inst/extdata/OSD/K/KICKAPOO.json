  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil typically is slightly acid or neutral, but ranges to mildly alkaline or strongly acid in some horizons.  Depth to buried Ab horizon is between 20 and 40 inches.  Coarse fragments consist of sandstone and dolostone.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1).  The Ap horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), dark brown (10YR 4/3), dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), or brown (10YR 5/3). The A or Ap horizon is loam or fine sandy loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizons have 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR hue; value of 2 through 8; and chroma of 1 through 4.  They ranges from rather uniform fine sandy loam and loam that contains less than 18 percent clay to alternate layers or bands of silt, sandy loam, loamy sand, sand, and loam or gravelly analogs.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 12 and 18 percent clay and from 40 to 70 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe Ab horizon is very dark brown (10YR 2/2), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  It typically is silt loam, but in some pedons it is silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Gravel content ranges form 0 to 15 percent.  Below a depth of 2 feet the soil commonly contains few to many medium distinct mottles of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR hue; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 1 through 6. Some pedons, however, are without mottling.  In some pedons, stratified loose sand is below a depth of 3 feet."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belfast, Colvard, and Wirt series in the same family and the Arenzville, Carr, Caryville, Chaseburg, Dorchester, Judson, Landes, Pope, Terril, and Worthen series.  Belfast, Colvard, and Wirt soils do not have an Ab horizon at a depth between 20 and 40 inches.  Arenzville and Chaseburg soils are coarse-silty.  Carr soils have a calcareous series control section. Caryville soils are sandy and have redder hues.  Dorchester soils are fine-silty and calcareous.  Judson and Worthen soils are fine-silty and cumulic. Landes soils have mollic epipedons.  Pope soils have a more acid series control section.  Terril soils are fine-loamy and have mollic epipedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kickapoo soils are typically on flood plains of streams.  Many areas of the soil are on natural levees near stream channels and old oxbows.  The topography is nearly level or gently undulating and slope gradients are less than 6 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium of mixed mineralogical composition. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 44 to 57 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Arenzville, Chaseburg, Judson, Terril, and Worthen soils and the Huntsville soils. Arenzville and Huntsville soils are in similar positions in the flood plain.  Huntsville soils have mollic epipedons and contain more silt. Chaseburg soils are in narrower and more sloping flood plains of small tributary streams.  Judson, Terril, and Worthen soils are typically on foot slopes and alluvial fans."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is moderately slow or slow.  Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid in the upper part and moderate in the lower part. Apparent water table is at 3.5 to 6.0 feet from October through June.  Kickapoo soils are subject to occasional flooding."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of the soil has been cleared.  Where the overflow hazard is slight, it is used for growing corn, small grains, and hay.  Where overflow is damaging, the soil is in pasture.  A few areas are in woods.  Natural vegetation was mixed hardwood forest, mainly American elm."
