  "OVERVIEW": "The Kornman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Kornman soils are on stream terraces.  The surface horizons formed in alluvium from sediment-rich irrigation water while the subsoil and substratum formed in mixed alluvium from sedimentary materials.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches).",
