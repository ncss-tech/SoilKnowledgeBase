The Ag2 horizon has iron accumulations in shades of brown, dark brown, yellowish brown, or dark yellowish brown. Recent overwash 6 to 12 inches thick that is dark grayish brown to light gray is common. Texture in the Ag1 horizon is fine sandy loam or loam and texture in the Ag2 horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Ag3 and Ag4 horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations in shades of brown or dark reddish brown range from few to common. Texture in the Ag3 horizon is sandy clay or clay loam and texture in the Ag4 horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kanebreak soils are on nearly level flood plains. Slopes are mainly 0 to 1 percent. The soil formed in loamy alluvium derived primarily from sediments of Blackland Prairie. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F.; average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E index is 72."

Gowker soils are moderately well drained and do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 20 inches. Kaman, Kaufman, and Trinity soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section and have smectitic mineralogy."
