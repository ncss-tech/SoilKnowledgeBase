Beasley and Enott soils have a paralithic contact at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Bledsoe, Estate, Lowell, and Vandalia soils do not have carbonates within the series control section. Bonnell soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to the base of the argillic horizon and to carbonates. Bucklick and Haggatt soils have a lithic contact at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Coneyville, Faywood, Fredonia, and Milton soils have a lithic contact at 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kewaunee soils are on ground, end, and recessional moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous, clayey  till of late Wisconsinan age and commonly in a thin mantle of loess. Less commonly, the thin upper mantle is loamy outwash or a windblown, reworked deposit. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 815 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Manawa and poorly drained Poygan soils are in a drainage sequence with the Kewaunee soils.  Hortonville soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizons.  Winneconne soils have more clay in their sola, formed in lacustrine deposits, and have darker colored Ap horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n11/04  510,756 acres have been correlated in 12 soil surveys in Wisconsin. None  of the typical pedons in the 12 surveys have redox features. Therefore this revision changes the concept of the Kewaunee series to well drained only.\n11/04  Lab data in 2 pedons from Manitowoc County and in 1 pedon from Calumet County shows high bulk density (1.89 to 1.97) in the C horizons (Cd?). Further study is needed to determine if the series concept should be changed to dense till.\n11/04  1850 acres in Brown County were correlated as a gravelly substratum phase (sandy & gravelly outwash at 40 to 60 inches).  A new series is needed for these acres.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) (Ap, E);  argillic horizon - 25 to 74 cm (10 to 29 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4);\nADDITIONAL DATA; Refer to soil survey sample numbers S59WI-015-001, S59WI-039-002, S60WI-071-001, S60WI-071-002 or National Soils Survey Laboratory pedon numbers 40A1538, 40A1539, 40A1540, and 40A1541 for NSSL data on some pedons of Kewaunee.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
