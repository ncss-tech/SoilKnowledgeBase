  "OVERVIEW": "The Kapulehu series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 1140 millimeters (45 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F).",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of undulating to rolling `a`a lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 760 to 1520 millimeters (30 to 60 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 19 to 22 degrees C (67 to 72 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
