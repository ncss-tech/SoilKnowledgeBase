The soils\nformed in a veneer of loess or silty alluvium which overlies basalt.\nAverage annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  Average\nJanuary temperature is about 28 degrees F, average July temperature is\nabout 75 degrees F, and average annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees\nF.  Frost-free period is about 110 to 160 days."
