  "STATES": "PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Knauers series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in recent alluvial deposits derived from sandstones and shales.  They are on the backwater areas of floodplains with slightly depressed slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and high in the A and B horizons, and high to very high in the C horizon.  Mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and 35 to 70 percent in the substratum. The soil is strongly acid through slightly acid throughout\nThe A or  Ap horizon have hue of 7.5YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate granular and consistence is very friable or friable.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5 YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less with redoximorphic concentrations of iron and manganese.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction, usually becoming sandier with increasing depth.  Structure is subanglular blocky, prismatic, or granular and consistence is very friable or friable.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid though slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction.  It is massive or single grain, and consistence is loose.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid."

This series was established to separate the poorly drained portions of Bowmansville in some surveys and map units that classify as Typic Fluvaquents and have sandy particle size at less than 40 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon)\nb. Fluvaquent feature - The organic carbon is greater than .2 percent above the sandy C horizon and the dominant chroma of the B horizon is 2 with mottling.\n2/2008 Revision updates pedon description.
