Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, chroma of 2 through 4. It is slightly hard or hard. This horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous. It ranges from 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is cobbly loam or cobbly heavy sandy loam."

The soils formed in a mantle of soil material 10 to 20 inches thick formed in place over limestone and calcareous sandstone bedrock. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. Mean summer temperature is 64 to 66 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches. March and April are the wettest months and June is the driest. Frost-free period is 100 to 108 days."

(The A1 and A2 horizon)\nCarbonatic mineralogy - in the particle size control section the fraction less than 20 mm in size averages more than 40 percent carbonates plus gypsum.\nLithic feature - limestone bedrock at 17 inches.\nXeric feature - soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nIn June of 1994 the classification of this series was changed from a Torriorthent to a Xerorthent in order to provide consistent correlation of range sites and soil moisture regimes in Utah.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
