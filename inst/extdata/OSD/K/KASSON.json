  "OVERVIEW": "The Kasson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying till.  These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters.",
