  "OVERVIEW": "The Kosh series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rocks and rhyolite. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent in mountains, canyons and intermontane basins. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
