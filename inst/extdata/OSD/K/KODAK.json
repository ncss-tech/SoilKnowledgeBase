  "OVERVIEW": "The Kodak soils are very deep, moderately welldrained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. These soils are on lake plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
