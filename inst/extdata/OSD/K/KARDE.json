  "OVERVIEW": "The Karde series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silt and very fine sand deposited on the leeward side of dry or intermittent lake beds.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Calcium carbonate content of the upper 40 inches ranges from 40 to 70 percent.  Soluble salt content is usually low to moderate but ranges to high and a saline phase is recognized.\nThe A and AC horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, and 4 through 6 moist, chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, and 5 to 7 moist,  chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam."

Dean soils are fine-loamy and have a calcic horizon.  Drake soils have a thermic temperature regime.  Manvel and Willard soils average 40 percent or less calcium carbonate in the control section.  Minnequa soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Rance and Reeves soils have gypsic mineralogy."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from  48 to 54 degrees F.
