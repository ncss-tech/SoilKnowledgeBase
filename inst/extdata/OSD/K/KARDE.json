    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Calcium carbonate content of the upper 40 inches ranges from 40 to 70 percent.  Soluble salt content is usually low to moderate but ranges to high and a saline phase is recognized.\nThe A and AC horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, and 4 through 6 moist, chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, and 5 to 7 moist,  chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam."

Dean soils are fine-loamy and have a calcic horizon.  Drake soils have a thermic temperature regime.  Manvel and Willard soils average 40 percent or less calcium carbonate in the control section.  Minnequa soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Rance and Reeves soils have gypsic mineralogy."

The soils formed in silty and very fine sandy material that is quite uniformly high in calcium carbonate with local areas high in soluble salts as well.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from  48 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 160 days and elevation ranges from 4,900 to 7,200 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E Index is 26."
