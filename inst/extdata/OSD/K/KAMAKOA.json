These soils are near intermittent streams on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains on lava flows that are 65,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 381 to 762 millimeters (15 to 30 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1780 to 2030 millimeters (70 to 80 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 15 to 22 degrees C. (60 to 71 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
