    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kamaoa, Kapapala, Kikoni, Kiolakaa, Kula, and Waimea series. Kamaoa soils have strong structure in the A horizon and have a silty clay loam Bw horizon that is slightly to moderately plastic. Kapapala soils have a depositional, non-alluvial ashy coarse sand 2C horizon. Kikoni soils have strong granular structure in the A horizon and strong subangular blocky structure in the 2Bw horizon. Kiolakaa soils are moderately deep to pahoehoe bedrock. Kula soils have silty clay loam Bw horizons. Waimea soils do not have an alluvial C horizon and are not on flood plains."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kamakoa soils are on mid elevation, leeward slopes of Mauna Kea and Kohala shield volcanoes at elevations from 457 to 1280 meters (1500 to 4200 feet). These soils are near intermittent streams on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains on lava flows that are 65,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 381 to 762 millimeters (15 to 30 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1780 to 2030 millimeters (70 to 80 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 15 to 22 degrees C. (60 to 71 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
