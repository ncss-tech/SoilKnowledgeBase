  "OVERVIEW": "The Kitchen Creek series is a member of the coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic family of Ultic Argixerolls.  Typically, Kitchen Creek soils have dark brown, slightly acid, loamy coarse sand and coarse sandy loam A horizons, pale brown, medium acid, coarse-sandy loam B2t horizons grading to weathered granitic rock at a depth of 54 inches,",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 58 degrees F.  Soil between depths of 8 and 24 inches usually is moist in some part from about December 1 until June 1 and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  Base saturation is 65 to 75 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches of the soil profile.  Some of the upper part has 75 to 80 percent base saturation and all of the soil below a depth of 30 inches has about 80 to 90 percent base saturation.  The A horizon is brown, dark brown or very dark grayish brown in 10YR hue.  Moist value and hue is less than 3.5.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent to 12 inches depth and averages less than 1 percent at 20 inches depth.  This horizon has weak or moderate granular structure in the upper part or in all parts.  In some pedons the lower part of this horizon is massive.  It is soft or slightly hard when dry and is slightly acid or neutral.  This soil has a transitional A3 or B1 horizon or the A1-B2t boundary is gradual.  The B2t horizon is brown, light brown, pale brown or very pale brown in 10YR and 7.5YR hue.  It is coarse sandy loam or heavy coarse sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay.  The absolute clay increase from A horizon to B2t horizon is about 3 to 8 percent.  This horizon is medium acid to neutral.  A transitional B3 horizon is present or the boundary between the B2t horizon and C horizon is gradual."

Ahwahnee soils lack sufficient organic matter to qualify for a mollic epipedon and have mean annual temperature of 60 degrees F.  Blasingame and Fallbrook soils have hard and massive A horizons and more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizons.  Crouch soils lack argillic horizons.  Tretten soils have mean annual temperature greater than 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kitchen Creek soils are moderately sloping to strongly sloping at elevations of 2,500 to 4,500 feet and are on sloping to rolling broad ridges that are boundary by short escarpment slopes.  They formed in residuum weathered from granitic and other acid igneous rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and relatively short mild moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches.   Average January temperature is about 45 degrees F., average July temperature is about 70 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is about 160 to 185 days."
