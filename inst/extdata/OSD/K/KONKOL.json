  "OVERVIEW": "The Konkol series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in volcanic ash, alluvium and lacustrine sediments.  They are on hills on plateaus and low mountain ridges and have slopes of 5 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
