    "content": "REMARKS:   Soil interpretive record: MT1745.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from 1 to 9 inches (A and E horizons); a cambic horizon from 9 to 27 inches (Bw and BC horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 27 inches (Bw and BC horizons); a layer of decomposing welded tuff from 27 to 35 inches (Cr horizon); welded tuff bedrock at 35 inches (R horizon).  Karloff soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Ashy-skeletal, glassy Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Ashy-skeletal, glassy Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
