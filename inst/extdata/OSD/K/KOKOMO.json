  "OVERVIEW": "The Kokomo series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy materials overlying till. Kokomo soils are in depressions on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Drained and undrained phases are recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
