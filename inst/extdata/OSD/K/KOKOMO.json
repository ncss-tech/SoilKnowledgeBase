Grannycreek are in areas that receive more than 1067 mm (42 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Lippincott soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Tanglenook soils have a mollic epipedon that is thicker than 61 cm (24 inches)."

The poorly drained Brookston soils are on similar landforms as the Kokomo soils. The moderately well drained Celina and Xenia soils and the somewhat poorly drained Crosby and Fincastle soils are on swells on till plains. The moderately well drained Miami and well drained Russell soils are on swells and knolls on till plains and on shoulders and backslopes on dissected till plains."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1.0 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during the winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low in the loamy materials, and moderately low in the underlying till. Permeability is moderately slow or slow in the loamy materials and slow in the underlying till."

Drained and undrained phases are recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
