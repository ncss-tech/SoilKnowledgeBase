In unplowed areas the A horizon is about 10 cm (4 inches) thick and has value of 3 or 4.\nTexture--silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Some areas are eroded.\nThe E horizon (if it occurs):\nColor--hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 1 to 4.\nTexture--ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon:\nColor--hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 7, and chromas of 0 to 8 with 1 and 2 chromas only in the Btg horizon of some pedons.\nTexture--ranges from silty clay loam or clay loam to silty clay and clay. Some pedons have thin layers of silt loam. Mean clay content is about 40 percent in the control section.\nRedoximorphic features--iron depletions with 2 or lower chroma are in the Bt horizon between 51 and 76 cm (20 and 30 inches) from the soil surface.\nStructure--commonly angular or subangular blocky, but prismatic or columnar structure occurs in many pedons and platy structure is found in a few pedons.\nThe C or Cg horizon:\nColor--hue of 10YR to 5Y, values of 2 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 8. High values and chroma are in moderately coarse and coarse textural strata.\nTexture--typically silty clay loam but ranges from clay to loamy sand.\nOther features--thin, discontinuous layers of ironstone 1 to 3 mm (1/16 to 1/8 inches) thick form in both vertical and horizontal fracture faces in the C horizon of some pedons. Pyrite nodules also occur in some pedons."
