  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The thickness of the organic material ranges from 16 to 47 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 21 to 51 inches.  A thin layer of undecomposed forest litter may occur on the soil surface.  Where present, the mineral horizon is less than 16 inches thick.  pH is extremely acid or very strongly acid in the organic materials; strongly acid or moderately acid in the mineral material.  The soil does not freeze below a depth of 2 inches in most years due to maritime influence.\nThe hue of the O horizons range from 10R to 10YR, the value moist from 2 to 4, and the chroma moist ranges from 1 to 4.\nWhen present, the C horizon has hue from 5GY through 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Texture is commonly silt loam, but ranges to include coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, loam and sand.  Coarse fragments range from 10 to 50 percent."

The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 43 degrees F and the mean summer air temperature is 58 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 3000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 80 percent."

Hydaburg soils are shallow organic soils composed of hemic sedge peat that are on ridges.  Karta, Kupreanof, Tolstoi, St. Nicholas, and Wadleigh soils are mineral soils on valleysides and hillslopes.  Kina soils are deep hemic peats that are in valley bottoms and on benches on hillslopes."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The Kaikli soils are in forested muskegs that have a marginal potential for timber production.  The soils are also used for wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed protection.  Overstory vegetation is predominantly western hemlock and western redcedar with lesser amounts of Sitka spruce and Alaska-cedar.  The understory vegetation is mainly blueberry and huckleberry species, skunk cabbage, and marshmarigold."
