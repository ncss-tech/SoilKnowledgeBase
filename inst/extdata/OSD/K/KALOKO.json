Keaau soils have 10YR hue in the A horizon, are slightly calcareous above 20-inch depth and are underlain by consolidated coral sand or hard coral at depths from 20 to 36 inches.  Nohili soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Pearl Harbor soils are noncalcareous in the upper 20 inches and are underlain by muck or peat at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kaloko soils are on coastal plains.  The dominant slope is about 1 percent and elevation ranges from sea level to 20 feet.   The upper part of the regolith is alluvium from material weathered from basic igneous rocks and the lower part marly material that was deposited in lagoons.  Average annual rainfall is 20 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.; average January temperature is 71 degrees F.; and average July temperature is 77 degrees F."

Kekaha soils are at slightly higher elevations and are well drained, noncalcareous, and have 5YR or redder hue in the B horizon.  Mokuleia soils have 10YR hue in the A horizon and coral sand at less than 20-inch depth."
