  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanapaha series consists of poorly drained soils with a slowly or moderately slowly permeable subsoil.  The soils formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  They are on nearly level to gently sloping landscapes of upland position in the lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Content of plinthite, weathered phosphatic pebbles and iron concretions ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2, with or without mottles or streaks in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  It has few to many mottles in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  Texture is sandy loam to light sandy clay.  The weighted average clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Btg horizon is 16 to 35 percent.  The BCg horizon has about the same range as the Btg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  It is massive and has texture of sandy loam or sandy clay loam with medium or large masses of coarser or finer textured material."
