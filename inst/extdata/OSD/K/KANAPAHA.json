  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 or more inches. The soil is very strongly acid to medium acid in all horizons.  Content of plinthite, weathered phosphatic pebbles and iron concretions ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2, with or without mottles or streaks in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  It has few to many mottles in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  Texture is sandy loam to light sandy clay.  The weighted average clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Btg horizon is 16 to 35 percent.  The BCg horizon has about the same range as the Btg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  It is massive and has texture of sandy loam or sandy clay loam with medium or large masses of coarser or finer textured material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in\nthick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, average annual rainfall is about 59 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arredondo, Bivans, Blichton, Boardman, Kendrick, Lochloosa, Millhopper, Sparr, and Wacahoota series.  Arredondo and Kendrick soils are well drained.  Bivans and Boardman soils have an argillic horizon within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Lochloosa and Sparr soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Millhopper soils are moderately well drained.  Wacahoota soils have an argillic horizon between a depth of 20 to 40 inches below the soil surface."

The water table in these soils is at depths of less than 10 inches for 1 to 3 months and it recedes to depths of 10 to  40 inches for 3 to 4 months during most years.  It is at depths grater than 40 inches during drier periods."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils are in forest.  Small areas where adequate water control is established are used for growing corn, watermelons, citrus, and tomatoes.  Most of the\ncleared areas are used for improved pasture.  Native vegetation consists of sweetgum, maple, live and water oaks; magnolia, hickory, slash, longleaf and loblolly pine; and an understory of several bluestem species, longleaf uniola, hairy panicum, several threeawn species and numerous forbs."
