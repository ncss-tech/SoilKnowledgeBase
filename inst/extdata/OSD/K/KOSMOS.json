  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kosmos soils are on terraces at elevations of 300 to 400 feet.  These soils formed in glaciofluvial material (possibly old volcanic mudflow).  The climate is marine and characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 50 to 60 inches mostly as rainfall.  The average July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 35 degrees F.  The average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 165 to 180 days.  The growing season is 220 to 240 days."
