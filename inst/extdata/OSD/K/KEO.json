    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 28 to about 50 inches. Reaction of the A and B horizons is slightly acid through moderately alkaline. Materials underlying the B horizon are neutral through moderately alkaline, and are calcareous or noncalcareous.\nThe A or Ap horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/4), dark brown (7.5YR 4/2), or reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4). Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has colors of brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/4), dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2), reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4; 5YR 4/4), or dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3, 3/4; 2.5YR 3/4). Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe materials underlying the B horizons are similar to the Bw in color. They are fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Bruin soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less between the bottom of the Ap and 24 inches. Cascilla soils are strongly acid, have lower base saturation, and have 18 to 35 percent clay. Coushatta soils are finer textured, with 18 to 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section. Morganfield, Norwood, and Robinsonville soils do not have cambic horizon and have bedding planes. Also, Norwood soils are calcareous in the 10- to 40-inch section and have more than 18 percent clay. Oklared and Robinsonville soils have more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Oklared and Severn soils are calcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils are in the flood plains of the Arkansas and Red Rivers, possibly in the Mississippi Valley. They formed in loamy alluvial deposits. Average annual temperature at the type location is about 62 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 49 inches."
