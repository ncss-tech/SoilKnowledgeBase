  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weathered shale bedrock ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  In some pedons masses of carbonates are at the contact with the shale.  The soil contains a few pebbles and cobbles and an occasional boulder of granite in the upper part.  The soil is slightly acid to moderately alkaline above the Cr horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam containing 2 to 20 percent by volume of soft shale fragments.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe part of the C horizon above the Cr horizon has hue of 5Y, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Soft shale fragments increase with depth and in some pedons they exceed 50 percent by volume in the lower part of the C horizon above the paralithic contact.\nThe Cr horizon consists of weathered shale bedrock."

The soil formed in glacial till overlying shale bedrock or material weathered from shale bedrock.  Mean annual air temperature is about 34 to 45 degrees F, and  mean annual precipitation is about 15 to 20 inches."

Buse soils are on shoulder slopes above the Kloten soils.  Edgeley, Mekinock, Olga and Walsh soils are on side slopes and foot slopes below the Kloten soils.  Sioux soils are one nearby terraces."
