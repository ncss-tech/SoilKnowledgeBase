  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenny Lake series consists of well drained soils formed in silty loess over lacustrine deposits.  Kenny Lake soils are on broad high lacustrine terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 16 to 27 inches.  The particle size of the upper part of the control section commonly is silt loam but includes silt and very fine sandy loam with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The lower part of the control section is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam with greater than 35 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper horizons, ranging to moderately alkaline in the contrasting substratum.\nThe A horizon matrix has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10 YR; moist value of 2 or 3; moist chroma of 1 or 2.  This horizon contains streaks and strata of varying thickness.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A/B horizon has dominant moist hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; moist value of 2 or 3; moist chroma of 1 or 2.  The horizon contains many streaks and patches of varying color and thickness.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Rock fragments control ranges from 0-15 percent.  Effervescence is none to slightly in the upper layers and increases to strongly with depth.  Free carbonates are disseminated throughout."

Most areas have been burned, resulting in the transition from Copper River to Kenny Lake soils.  The successional state of vegetation in a given area is closely related to the fire history.  Small areas are cleared and used for small grains, grass, and vegetables."
