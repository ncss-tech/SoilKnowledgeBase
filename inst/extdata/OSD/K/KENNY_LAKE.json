  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 16 to 27 inches.  The particle size of the upper part of the control section commonly is silt loam but includes silt and very fine sandy loam with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The lower part of the control section is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam with greater than 35 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper horizons, ranging to moderately alkaline in the contrasting substratum.\nThe A horizon matrix has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10 YR; moist value of 2 or 3; moist chroma of 1 or 2.  This horizon contains streaks and strata of varying thickness.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A/B horizon has dominant moist hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; moist value of 2 or 3; moist chroma of 1 or 2.  The horizon contains many streaks and patches of varying color and thickness.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Rock fragments control ranges from 0-15 percent.  Effervescence is none to slightly in the upper layers and increases to strongly with depth.  Free carbonates are disseminated throughout."

Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature varies from 23 degrees to 27 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

The organic mat of the Copper River soils is undisturbed, resulting in better insulation, lower soil temperature, and permafrost within the control section."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Kenny Lake soils have native vegetation of white spruce, quaking aspen, paper birch, and willows.  Most areas have been burned, resulting in the transition from Copper River to Kenny Lake soils.  The successional state of vegetation in a given area is closely related to the fire history.  Small areas are cleared and used for small grains, grass, and vegetables."
