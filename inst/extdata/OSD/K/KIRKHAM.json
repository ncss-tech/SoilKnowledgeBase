Elevations are 1,280 to 1,740 meters. These soils formed in stratified alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, limestone, gneiss, and granite. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 425 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10.5 degrees C., the mean summer temperature is 18.5 to 22.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 75 cm (shallow or moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between April and August. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round or occasional flooding for brief periods between April and June."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm. (Ap horizon)\nFluventic features - Irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth in the zone from 25 to 125 cm. (C1 and C2 horizons and part of the A horizon)\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 50 and 75 cm at certain times during normal years. (parts of the C1, C2, and 2C3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm. (C1 horizon and parts of the A and C2 horizons)\nThe revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haplustolls based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 140-141, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.  The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by this data.\nPrevious authors and editors include: RLM-VLP-MJD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
