  "OVERVIEW": "The Kirkham series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Kirkham soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps, lake plains and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 375 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",

(C1 and C2 horizons and part of the A horizon)\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 50 and 75 cm at certain times during normal years. (parts of the C1, C2, and 2C3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm.
