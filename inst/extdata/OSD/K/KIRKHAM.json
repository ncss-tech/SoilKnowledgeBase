  "OVERVIEW": "The Kirkham series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Kirkham soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps, lake plains and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 375 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm. (Ap horizon)\nFluventic features - Irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth in the zone from 25 to 125 cm. (C1 and C2 horizons and part of the A horizon)\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 50 and 75 cm at certain times during normal years. (parts of the C1, C2, and 2C3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm. (C1 horizon and parts of the A and C2 horizons)\nThe revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haplustolls based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 140-141, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.  The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by this data.\nPrevious authors and editors include: RLM-VLP-MJD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
