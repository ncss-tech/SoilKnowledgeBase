  "OVERVIEW": "The Kushneahin series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in partially to well decomposed plant material.  Kushneahin soils are in depressional areas on lowlands, benches on mountain sideslopes, and broad ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 inches.",

The surface tier is dominantly hemic material with the uppermost layer typically fibric material.  The subsurface tier is sapric material with hue ranging from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3 and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Content of coarse woody fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction is very strongly or extremely acid throughout."

Kina and Kogish soils are on similar positions; Kina soils are mainly hemic material and Kogish soils are mainly fibric material.  Maybeso soils are on similar landforms but are underlain by loamy till within 52 inches."
