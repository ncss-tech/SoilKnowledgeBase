    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The thickness of the organic material is greater than 52 inches.  The surface tier is dominantly hemic material with the uppermost layer typically fibric material.  The subsurface tier is sapric material with hue ranging from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3 and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Content of coarse woody fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction is very strongly or extremely acid throughout."

Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent, but is dominantly between 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 60 to over 200 inches.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 2500 feet."

Kina and Kogish soils are on similar positions; Kina soils are mainly hemic material and Kogish soils are mainly fibric material.  Maybeso soils are on similar landforms but are underlain by loamy till within 52 inches."
