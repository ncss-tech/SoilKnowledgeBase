Koch soils are in a mild, marine climate.  Summers are cool and dry, winters are mild and wet.  Mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F.  January temperature is about 39 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 80 inches.  The growing season above 28 degrees F.\ni. 160 to 215 days.  The frost-free season above 32 degrees F. is 150 to 180 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  This draft reflects a change in classification from coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, acid, mesic Cumulic Humaquepts to sandy-skeletal, mixed, nonacid, mesic Aquandic Humaquepts.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 22 inches and an assumed aquic moisture regime.  This draft reflects an update of a 1953 description.  No new data is on hand.  The classification is based on the 1953 description.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 6/88.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
