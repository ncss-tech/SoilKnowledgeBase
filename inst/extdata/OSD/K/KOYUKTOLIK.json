  "OVERVIEW": "The Koyuktolik series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in accumulations of partially decomposed mosses, sedges, and woody material. Koyuktolik soils are on slopes affected by seepage and in depressions between glacial moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  The subsurface tier is composed dominantly of hemic material but includes thin layers of fibric and sapric material.  Thickness of the organic material ranges from 51 inches to more than several feet.\nThe Oi horizon is comprised dominantly of sphagnum moss fibers and woody debris that are relatively undecomposed. Thickness of the Oi horizon ranges from 2 to 21 inches.  Thin discontinuous strata of volcanic ash are common.\nThe Oe horizon is comprised dominantly of moss and sedge fibers that are in an intermediate stage of decomposition.  The pH ranges from 4.2 to 5.7.  Thin discontinuous strata of volcanic ash are common.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 45 percent with 15 to 35 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobble."

Koyuktolik soils are on slopes affected by seepage and in depressions between glacial moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Elevations are 10 to 1000 feet.\nThe climate is maritime with mild winters and cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 65 to 75 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 70 to 120 inches.  Mean January temperature is 25 degrees F., mean July temperature is 54  degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 39 degrees F."
