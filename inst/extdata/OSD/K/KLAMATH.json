    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Klamath soils are in depressions on broad flood plains at elevations of 3,900 to 5,400 feet. The soils formed in alluvium derived from diatomite and volcanic rock with minor amounts of volcanic ash and pumice derived from dacite. The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and cool dry summers. The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 35 inches. The average January temperature is 25 to 27 degrees F; the average July temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F; and the average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
