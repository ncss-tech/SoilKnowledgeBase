  "OVERVIEW": "The Klamath series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from diatomite and volcanic rock with minor amounts of volcanic ash and pumice derived from dacite.  Klamath soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
