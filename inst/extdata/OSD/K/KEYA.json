The mollic epipedon is 20 to 45 inches thick and extends into the Bt horizon in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2or 3. It typically is clay loam but is loam in some pedons. The Bt horizon averages between 24 and 34 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BC and C horizons have value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2.  They typically are fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam, but in some pedons loamy fine sand to gravelly sand is at depths below 40 inches.  The C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have buried horizons in the C horizon."

Albinas soils have a Bk horizon within a depth of 30 inches.  Bluewater soils are somewhat poorly drained and contain redox concentrations in the lower Bt.  Garrett soils are redder with hues of 5YR through 10R.   Haxtun soils have buried horizons within 25 inches.  Jarita soils have limestone bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Prosper and Renner soils have mottles above a depth of 40 inches.  Sampson and Vosburg soils consistently have carbonate above a depth of 40 inches. Tracylee and Wetterdon soils are drier in the soil moisture control section during the summer solstice.  Woodly and Woonsocket soils have more sand and less silt in the argillic horizon."
