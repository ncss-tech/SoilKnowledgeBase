    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the spodic horizons range from 6 to 12 inches.  The solum ranges from 7 to 18 inches thick.  Stones occupy from 0.1 to 15 percent of the surface.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 35 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble or stones.  Texture of the control section is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.  Tree throw has resulted in mixing and churning of horizons in many profiles.  There is more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.  Depth to sand and gravel is less than 10 inches.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value from 3 through 5 moist, and chroma from 1 through 3 moist.  Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or silt loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 30 percent with 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value moist of 2 through 6, and chroma moist of 1 through 4.  Textures include coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe C horizon is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or sand.  The C horizon has firm, massive structure."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:  (1) a spodic horizon from 3 to 11 inches with more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches.  (2) a weighted average of greater than 35 percent coarse fragments and loamy coarse sand texture from 5 to 60 inches.  That part of the spodic horizon that meets amorphous requirements does not extend more than 4 inches into the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The particle size of the control section has a significant relation to the physical and chemical properties of the soil."
