    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kegonsa soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and valley trains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed mostly in a mantle of loess or silty alluvium underlain  by calcareous sandy outwash.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 890 mm (28 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Matherton and the poorly drained Sebewa and Will form a drainage sequence with the Kegonsa soils.  Plano soils, having somewhat thicker dark surface horizons, occupy nearby areas where the silty deposits are more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick over the sand and gravel.  Fox, Dresden, and Warsaw soils occupy nearby areas where the thickness of the silty deposit is less than 61 cm (24 inches)."

A new typical pedon site is needed. (Could possibly move south across the road into section 21)\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (Ap, E); argillic horizon - 31 to 84 cm (12 to 33 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3); mollic subgroup - Ap horizon that has color value and chroma, moist, of less than 4, and color value, dry, of less than 6.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
