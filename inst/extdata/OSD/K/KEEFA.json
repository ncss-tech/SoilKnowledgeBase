  "OVERVIEW": "The Keefa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Keefa soils are on inset fans, fan skirts and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
