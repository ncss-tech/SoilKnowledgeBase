The soils are on all hillslope positions of gently sloping to moderately steep ash fields on pahoehoe lava flows 250,000 to 400,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 6 to 20 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from basic volcanic ash and basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 178 to 508 millimeters (7 to 20 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2,286 to 2,540 meters (90 to 100 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees C. (73 to 80 degrees F.)
