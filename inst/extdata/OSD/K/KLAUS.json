  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Depth to the 2BC horizon is 12 to 30 inches and the depth to the iron cemented 2Bsm horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Pedons range from weakly smeary to moderately smeary in the E and B horizons.  The upper 14 to 30 inches of the solum is estimated to have andic soil properties.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, 0 through 3 dry. It contains 20 to 45 percent pumice or pumiceous volcanic ash. Texture is modified by 10 to 15 percent gravel. In some pedons, the E is destroyed due to logging activities. Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry. They average 10 to 45 percent pumiceous ash and 10 to 20 percent other volcanic ash from other sources.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma 2 through 6 moist or dry. The texture is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, or extremely gravelly sand. It averages 35 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones. The 2BC horizon contains a large root mass just above the 2BC horizon. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bsm and 2C horizons have colors and textures like the 2BC horizon. The 2Bsm horizon is weakly cemented with iron and extremely hard to break in place. When removed, it is easily broken by hand."
