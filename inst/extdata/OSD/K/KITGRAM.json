  "OVERVIEW": "The Kitgram series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone. Kitgram soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 millimeters (20 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. (43 degrees F.).",
