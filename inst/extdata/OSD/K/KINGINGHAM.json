  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingingham series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in a thin loess mantle over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Kingingham soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
