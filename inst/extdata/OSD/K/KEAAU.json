Hanalei soils contain 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarse sand in the control section and the solum is more than 60 inches thick.  Kaloko soils are strongly calcareous in the upper 20 inches and marl-like material is at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Kalihi soils have hue of 2.5Y or yellower below the A horizon, are noncalcareous throughout, and sola are 4 feet or more thick.  Mokuleia soils lack mottles and are underlain at shallow depth by coral sand."

The soils formed in alluvium washed from material that weathered from basic igneous rocks and deposited over reef limestone or consolidated coral sand.  Mean annual rainfall is 20 to 35 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.; average January temperature is 70 degrees F.; and average July temperature is 76 degrees F."
