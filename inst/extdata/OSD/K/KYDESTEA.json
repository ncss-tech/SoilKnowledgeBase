Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Elevation is 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, the average annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F, and the average frost-free period is 120 to 150 days.  The climate is cool, semi-arid and continental.  Precipitation falls as intense summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain or snow."
