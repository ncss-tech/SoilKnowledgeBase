  "OVERVIEW": "The Kingspeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hills and structural benches. They formed in mixed alluvium and lacustrine sediments with a mixed mantle of reworked loess and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 29 inches.",
