    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist they are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 90 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to cinders is 20 to 35 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The solum (A and AC horizons) contains 40 to 70 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 50 to 80 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water content of 5 to 10 percent on dried samples and 10 to 15 percent on undried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent cinders in the upper part and 90 percent or more cinders in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It contains 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Total coarse fragment content is 15 to 30 percent and are cinders.  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is neutral.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR moist and 7.5YR dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist or dry.  It is gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam.  It contains 25 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Total coarse fragment content is 25 to 40 percent and are cinders.  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist or dry.  It contains 80 to 100 percent cinders which are all gravel size."

The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 50 days."
