  "OVERVIEW": "The Klawatti series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash, colluvium, and slope alluvium from dunite or serpentine.  Klawatti soils are on mountain shoulder slopes and ridgetops.  Slopes are 10 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
