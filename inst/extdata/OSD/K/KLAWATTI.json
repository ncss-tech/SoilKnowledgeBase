The soils formed in volcanic ash, colluvium, and slope alluvium from dunite or serpentine.  Klawatti soils are in a marine climate with cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from November through May.  Average annual precipitation is 85 to 105 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 29 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 85 to 105 days."
