Organic carbon is less than 4 percent in some part of the upper 20 inches of the particle-size control section.  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F.  Angular cobbles, pebbles, and stones average from 60 to 80 percent by volume in the control section and are dominated by cobble-size fragments.  The soil is moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and 3 through 6 dry.  Cobbles range from 15 to 45 percent and pebbles from 10 to 45 percent.  Some pedons have up to 40 percent shot-like concretions in the upper part of the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist, and 3 to 6 dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Katula soils are on back slopes and shoulder slopes and on narrow ridges in mountainous areas.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  They are at elevations of 600 to 2,650 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from Eocene age basalt rock and an admixture of volcanic ash.  They occur in a humid marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 120 inches.  The average January temperature is about 36 degrees F, average July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 180 to 220 days."
