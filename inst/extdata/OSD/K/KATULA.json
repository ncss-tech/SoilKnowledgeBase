  "OVERVIEW": "The Katula series consists of moderately deep, well drained moderately permeable soils formed in basalt and an admixture of volcanic ash.  Katula soils are on narrow ridges, shoulders and back slopes of mountainous areas and have slopes of 5 to 90 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F and average annual precipitation is about 85 inches.",

They occur in a humid marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 120 inches.  The average January temperature is about 36 degrees F, average July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.
