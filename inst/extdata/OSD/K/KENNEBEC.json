  "OVERVIEW": "The Kennebec series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys and on drainageways on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.",
