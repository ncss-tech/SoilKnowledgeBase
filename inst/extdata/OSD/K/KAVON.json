  "OVERVIEW": "The Kavon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till and colluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on hillsides.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
