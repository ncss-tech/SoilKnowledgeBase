  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kali soils are on mid elevation, leeward slopes of Mauna Loa Volcano at elevations from 305 to 1067 meters (1000 to 3500 feet). These soils are in depressions of constructional landscapes on nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 635 to 1270 millimeters (25 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1524 millimeters (50 to 60 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges from 18 to 21 degrees C. (65 to 70 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
