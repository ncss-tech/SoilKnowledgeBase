  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kai soils are on terraces that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 225 to 400 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F., and the frost free season is 250 to 300 days. This soil only occurs on native, relatively undisturbed, never before farmed landscapes."
