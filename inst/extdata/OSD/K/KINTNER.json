  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kintner soils are on narrow flood plains, flood-plain steps, and alluvial fans below moderately sloping to very steep hills.  They formed in up to 76 centimeters (30 inches) of medium-textured alluvium and the underlying medium and moderately coarse textured alluvium containing a high percentage of rock fragments.  The rock fragments are washed from the surrounding limestone hill slopes.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches) and mean annual temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F).  Frost free period is from 170 to 200 days."

The well drained, less gravelly Haymond soil formed in silty alluvium.  The well drained, more clayey Caneyville, Haggatt, Knobcreek and Vertrees soils are formed in residuum from limestone."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the medium-textured alluvium (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) and high in the underlying loamy-skeletal alluvium (14.11 to 42.34 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately rapid in the lower part.  An intermittent apparent high water table is a depth of 76 to 106 centimeters (30 to 42 inches) from December through April in normal years."

The acreage of this soil is expected to increase as more counties in MLRA 122 are updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data for the Typical Pedon (S05-IN061-002) is at the NSSL in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
