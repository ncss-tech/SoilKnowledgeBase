  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick over siltstone or sandstone.\nThe A horizon, where present, is black (10YR 2/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).\nThe E horizon, where present, is dark gray (10YR 4/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light grayish brown (10YR 6/2), or grayish brown (10YR 4/2).   The texture of the A and E horizons is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is light olive gray (5Y 6/2), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4, 5/6), pale brown (10YR 6/3), pale olive (5Y 6/3, 6/4), olive gray (5Y 5/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6) silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages between 35 and 55 percent clay.  Mottles are few or common in shades of brown.  It is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  The Bt2 horizon consists of 15 to 30 percent siltstone or sandstone fragments 1/2 to 1 cm thick and 2 to 10 cm long oriented horizontally.\nThe 2Cr horizon is sandstone or siltstone."

Iredell soils have less acid Bt horizons.  Shadygrove soils do not have Cr horizons.  Boswell Kirvin, and Susquehanna soils have red Bt horizons and thicker sola.   Cadeville soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have Cr horizons.  Gore, McKamie, Oktibbeha, and Wilcox soils have redder Bt horizons and higher COLE values or greater potential linear extensibility.  Kipling soils have yellowish brown Bt horizons and higher COLE values or greater potential linear extensibility."

These soils formed in acid clay and silty clay marine sediments.  Climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature at the type location is 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 56 inches."

Anacoco soils have grayer colors and an abrupt textural change from the A to the Bt horizon.  Rigolette soils are on concave side slopes and are fine-loamy.  Sumter soils have carbonatic control sections.  Vaiden soils have very fine textures and higher COLE values."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was included with Lauderdale in previous soil survey reports in Louisiana.  These soils have developed in material which is reported in geological surveys as having abundant glass, pumice, and bentionite.  Base saturation by Holmgren field kit is 68 percent.  COLE is 0.081 just above the siltstone.  Colors of 2 chroma in the subsoil are attributed to color of parent material rather than wetness.  The soil is not saturated in any season.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU. S. A."
