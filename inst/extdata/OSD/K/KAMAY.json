    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to films, threads, masses or concretions of calcium carbonate ranges from 12 to 28 inches.  Average clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  The boundary between the A and Bt horizon is abrupt or clear with an abrupt textural change.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam and it is massive and hard or very hard when dry.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonates content rangse from none in the upper part to about 2 percent.\nThe Btk or Bt' horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The Btk horizon has 3 to about 15 percent concretions and/or masses of calcium carbonate.  The Bt' horizon, where present, has less than 3 percent carbonates.\nSome pedons have a BC, BCt, or BCtk horizons in shades of red, brown or yellow.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or clay.\nThe Cr horizon, when encountered, has colors in shades of red or brown with strata or mottles in shades of gray or brown.  It is dense clay or shale and restricts roots."

Similar soils are the Abilene, Bethany, Bronte, Foard, Hollister, Kirkland, Renfrow, Rotan, Sagerton, Tillman, and Wichita series.  Abilene, Hollister, Kirkland, and Rotan soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Foard soils have a natric horizon.  Renfrow soils have vertic properties.  Sagerton and Tillman soils have mollic epipedons and do not have an abrupt textural change.  Wichita soils are similar in morphology but do not have an abrupt textural change, and have mixed clay mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kamay soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands.  Slopes are mainly less than 2 percent but range up to 3 percent.  The soil formed in ancient alluvium derived from red bed clays and shales.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 32 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,300 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 36 to 46."
