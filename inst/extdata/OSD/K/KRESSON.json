  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: It is believed that Kresson soils have aquic conditions and have episaturation. The classification of these soils as Aquic Hapludults is based on evidence of wetness other than low chroma. Low chroma depletions which are normal in other somewhat poorly drained soils are rare in these soils. For this reason the depth to, extent, and distinctness of high chroma masses of oxidized iron have been used to group these soils with soils of similar natural drainage.\n12/2001--This revision relocates the official Kresson type location to a different map unit in Gloucester County because the previous location has become urbanized.\nDiagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 41 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has periodic saturation and reduction within 12 to 18 inches of the soil surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 80 inches of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone(episaturation).\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches"
