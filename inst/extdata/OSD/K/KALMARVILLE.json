  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the sandy 2Cg horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Free carbonates in some pedons are present in some parts of the 10 to 20 inch depth zone.  The content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 10 percent in the 2C horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4, but strata with value of 5 or 6 are in some pedons.  It has value of 3 in the upper 10 inches after mixing.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam, but it has coarser-textured strata in some pedons and is silty clay loam in the upper part in a few pedons.  An Ap horizon is present in a few pedons.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C or 2Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is typically coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, but the upper part may have loamy textures.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sand, fine sand or coarse sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kalmarville soils have plane or concave slopes and are on the lowest floodplain adjacent to streams.  Slope gradients are less than 1 percent.  Relative relief in their major area of occurrence ranges from 50 to 400 feet.  These soils formed in recent alluvium from glaciated or loess mantled terrain.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 32 inches."
