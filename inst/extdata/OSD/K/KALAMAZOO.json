Amanda, Caprell, Conestoga, Crouse, Greybrook, Hickory, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, Richardville, Senachwine, Skelton, Wawaka, and Wawasee soils lack sandy textures in the lower part of the series control section. Belmont, High Gap, Lumberton, Military, Pignut, and Woodbine soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 in). Belmore soils average more than 5 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Chili soils formed in outwash composed mainly of non-calcareous sandstone and shale with a large amount of quartz gravel. Cliftycreek, Gallman, Martinsville, Ockley, Princeton, and Riddles soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 in) to the base of the argillic horizon. Kosciusko, Leroy, and Strawn soils are less than 102 cm (40 in) to carbonates. Mocksville and Turnersburg soils consist of residuum from intermediate or mafic metamorphic or igneous rock. Relay soils have coarse fragments dominated by gabbro, granodiorite or metagabbro and have hues of 2.5Y to 5GY in the B horizons."

The coarser textured Boyer, Oshtemo, and Spinks are associated in some areas. Moderately well drained Bronson, somewhat poorly drained Matherton and Sleeth, and very poorly drained Sebewa soils are the most common associates. Also associated are the Dowagiac, Schoolcraft, and Volinia soils which are Mollisols and occur in areas of former prairie."
