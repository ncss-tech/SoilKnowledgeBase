Similar soils are the Allemands, Belhaven, Dare, Dorovan, Lafitte, Mattamuskeet, Maurepas, Okeechobee, Pamlico, Ponzer, Pungo, Terra Ceia, and Tomoka series.  Belhaven, Dare, Dorovan, Mattamuskeet, Pamlico, Ponzer, and Pungo series are extremely or strongly acid, undrained, in all parts of the control section.  Allemands and Tomoka series as well as Belhaven, Mattamuskeet, and Ponzer soils have thick mineral layers above 51 inches.  Lafitte, Maurepas, Okeechobee, and Terra Ceia soils do not have thin mineral layers within the 12 to 51 inch control section.  In addition, Lafitte soils have a sodium absorption ratio of 12 to 18 and exchangeable sodium percentage of 8 to 27 in the subsurface tier.  Also, Okeechobee and Pungo soils have layers in the 12 to 51 inch section that have 10 to 33 percent rubbed fiber content."

Elevations are approximately 2 feet above mean sea level and lower.  They formed from herbaceous plant remains stratified with dominantly clayey alluvium.  The climate is subtropical. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F."

During tropical storms, floodwaters are 4 feet deep or more.  In protected and pumped areas, the water table typically is maintained at a depth of from 1 to 4 feet below the subsurface.  Internal drainage is very slow to none.  Permeability is very slow in mineral layers and rapid in organic layers."

Native vegetation is dominantly paille fine, cattail, common reed, bulrush, bulltongue, alligatorweed, smartweed, lotus, water hyacinth, and cutgrass.  A few areas are diked and drained by pumps, then used for urban development."
