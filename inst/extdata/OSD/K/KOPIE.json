They formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived dominantly from sandstone and sandy shale.  The climate is semiarid with precipitation of 11 to 14 inches occurring as thunderstorms in July, August and September, and as rain and snow in winter.  Mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 120 to 180 days."
