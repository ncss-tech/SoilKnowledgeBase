  "OVERVIEW": "The Kopie series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits from sandstone and sandy shale.  These soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
