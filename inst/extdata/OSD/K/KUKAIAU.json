These soils are on all hillslope positions of gently sloping to steep ash fields and gulches on lava flows. Slope gradients range from 0 to 70 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,778 to 2,540 millimeters (70 to 100 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees C. (64 to 72 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C.
