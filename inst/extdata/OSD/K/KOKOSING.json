  "OVERVIEW": "The Kokosing series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
