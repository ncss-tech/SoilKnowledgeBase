Jericho soils average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have calcic horizons.  Lien soils have duripans at depths of 15 to 36 cm.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Karpp soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash over alluvium derived mainly from limestone.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,740 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
