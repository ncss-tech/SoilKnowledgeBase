  "OVERVIEW": "The Karpp series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash over alluvium derived mainly from limestone.  Karpp soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

These soils formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash over alluvium derived mainly from limestone.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,740 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
