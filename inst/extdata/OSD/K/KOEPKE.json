    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Koepke soils are on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated hills and mountains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial till.  Elevations are 1,900 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 24 inches. The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Hunters soils are fine-silty, have a mesic temperature regime, and are on terraces. Louploup soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on till plains and mountains. Mires soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on terraces. Nevine soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on moraines, foothills and mountains. Republic soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are on alluvial fans and terraces. Scoap soils are loamy-skeletal and are on uplands and mountainsides."
