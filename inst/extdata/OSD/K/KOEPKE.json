  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Koepke series consists of deep to a densic contact, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glacial till. The Koepke soils are on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches",

Mires soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on terraces. Nevine soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on moraines, foothills and mountains. Republic soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are on alluvial fans and terraces. Scoap soils are loamy-skeletal and are on uplands and mountainsides."
