Mean annual soil temperature is 71 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe B horizon above the Bbt horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 4 through 6 when moist; when dry value is 3 through 5 and chroma is 4 through 8.  The Bbt horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay.  A black 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick layer of decomposed roots is commonly on top of the panlike layer.  The amount of highly weathered rock fragments in the Bbt horizon varies within short distances, but it normally is between 30 and 40 percent by volume.  The reaction of the B horizon ranges from medium acid to extremely acid."
