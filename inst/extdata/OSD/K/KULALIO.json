  "OVERVIEW": "The Kulalio series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash deposited over `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1,295 millimeters (51 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
