  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaleva series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on outwash plains, lake plains, and moraines. These soils are formed in sandy deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 872 mm (34 in), and mean annual temperature is about 7.0 degrees C (45 degrees).",
