  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 46 to 97 cm. Depth to carbonates ranges from 38 to 97 cm. Bedrock is more than 152 cm below the soil surface and in most pedons is deeper than 1.8 meters. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent, by volume, in the surface layer and subsoil, increasing with depth, and range from 10 to 60 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Chroma of 2 is either in the matrix or on faces of peds above 51 cm. Common to many and fine to coarse redoximorphic features, mainly with chroma higher than that of the matrix are present. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction, with clay content 18 to 28 percent. The horizon has very weak, weak, or moderate subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Clay skins are very few or absent on faces of peds, but are present in pores of some pedons.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors similar to the B horizon, and textures similar to the C horizon. The BC horizon has very weak, weak, or moderate subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive or has plate like divisions. Consistence is friable to very firm. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Angola, Appleton, Atherton, Darien, Fredon, Fremont, Massena, and Ovid series are similar soils in related families. Angola, Appleton, Darien, and Ovid soils have an argillic horizon. Atherton soils lack carbonates within a depth of 102 cm and have stratification within 102 cm. Fredon and Massena soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Fremont soils do not have carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kendaia soils are nearly level to sloping soils on till plains where water from higher adjacent landforms is concentrated. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent, but most are less than 3 percent. The soils developed in strongly calcareous till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1440 millimeters, and the mean frost-free season ranges from 100 to 190 days. The elevation ranges from 140 to 500 meters above sea level."

The Alden and Lyons soils are wetter drainage associates. Amenia, Nellis, and Stockbridge soils are also better drained associates in some till landscapes. Honeoye and Lima, Lansing and Conesus, or Ontario and Hilton soils are drier drainage associates."
