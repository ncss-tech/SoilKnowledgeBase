  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Organic carbon ranges .5 to 2 percent in the surface layer, but decreases irregularly with depth.  Depth to endosaturation ranges from 22 to 36 inches from March through September in most years. Redoximorphic features are typically present the C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  When the moist value and chroma is as dark as 3/3, the horizon is too thin; if mixed to 7 inches, or if it is too light colored or contains too little organic carbon, it fails to qualify as a mollic epipedon.  The A horizon usually has subangular blocky structure, but it is granular in some pedons.  The clay content is 16 to 21 percent.  Calcium carbonate of the fine earth ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and sand, but the clay ranges from 3 to 27 percent, (weighted average is less than 18 percent in the particle-size control section), silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 20 to 95 percent.  Calcium carbonate of the fine earth ranges from 5 to 15 percent."

Nunn soils lack salt and occur higher on the landscape.  Satanta and Sampson are fine-loamy.  Also, Satanta occurs on higher landscapes."
