  "OVERVIEW": "The Kwakina series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium and stream alluvium derived from stratified multicolored sandstone formations on alluvial fans on valley sides and floodplains on valley floors. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The colors of the sandstone range from dark red to yellow. This is the reason for the range of hues being 2.5YR to 10YR.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999 and Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nUpdate and revisions for the correlation of Capitol Reef National Park, January 2013, WWJ"
