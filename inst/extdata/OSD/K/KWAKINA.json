Kwakina soils are on floodplains on valley floors and alluvial fans on valley sides. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 4,940 to 7,300 feet. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The frost free period is 120 to 160 days."

Mido soils are sandy throughout and occur on dunes. Hawaikuh soils have an argillic horizon. Zia soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon and are on fan terraces."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches. (A horizon)\nEntisol feature - lack of diagnostic horizons\nFluvent feature - irregular decrease in organic matter\nThe source of the parent material for the Kwakina soils are stratified multi-colored sandstone formations. The colors of the sandstone range from dark red to yellow. This is the reason for the range of hues being 2.5YR to 10YR.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999 and Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nUpdate and revisions for the correlation of Capitol Reef National Park, January 2013, WWJ\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
