    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe series is named after the town of Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, which was the location of the Wright Brothers' first controlled flight of the Wright Flyer. Kill Devil soils were previously mapped as water in North Carolina and Virginia soil surveys.\nTextures for the lower Cseg horizons can be variable, but are most often silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam; their color is typically 10Y or greener but can be as yellow as 2.5Y. Pedons in lagoon bottoms may have a thin surface mantle of sand. Some Kill Devil pedons have buried and preserved pre-Holocene genetic horizons (i.e., lithologic discontinuity) as shallow as 30 to 50 centimeters from the soil surface.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022):\nOchric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 17 centimeters.\nFluidity--The zone from 0 to 207 centimeters has a fluidity class of moderately or very fluid.\nPeraquic feature--Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface (permanently submerged).\nNASIS User Site and Pedon ID: S2024VA810001\n____________________________________________________________________________"
