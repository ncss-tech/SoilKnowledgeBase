  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The loess mantle ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick over the firm, glacial till substratum.  The solum ranges in thickness from 14 to 20 inches.  The solum is usually developed entirely in the loess mantle, but, in some pedons, extends into the till material.  Some pedons are bisequal.  The exchange complex of the sola is dominated by amorphous material.  Mottles occur in the lower part of the spodic horizon and in the substratum.  Based on morphological evidence the water table is commonly near the surface.  However, it ranges below 25 inches in pedons with altered drainage due to natural lowering of the water table.  Reaction of the profile ranges from extremely to strongly acid.\nThe surface horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 10YR; value moist from 2 to 4; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizons have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.   Buried B horizons, when present, are similar in color and texture.\nThe 2C horizon is massive, firm, loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent, with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble."

Grewingk soils have gravelly substratums within 10 inches of the surface.  Both of these soils have a ratio of free iron to carbon greater than 0.2 in the spodic horizon."

The soils formed in a ash-influenced loess mantle overlying firm glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 30 to 34 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 32 inches."
