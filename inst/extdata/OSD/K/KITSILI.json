Begay and Delvalle soils have epipedons with more organic carbon.  Koshare soils have a significantly higher content of mica.  Ignacio, Ojito and Turnback soils are moderately deep.  Parida, Remmit, and Sandspring soils have hues of 10YR or yellower. In addition, Remmit and Turnback soils are in the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kitsili soils are on fan terraces, and summits of mesas and plateaus. They formed in alluvium and eolian material derived from Triassic and Jurassic sandstone. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches about half of which falls as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The remainder falls as gentle rain or snow between December and mid-April. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
