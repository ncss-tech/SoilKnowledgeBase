The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc. Depth to bedrock is 40 and 60 inches.   Phosphate retention is 25 to 35 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron is between 0.4 and 1.0 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  There is 50 to 65 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  The 15-bar water is 8 to 12 percent on air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has a field estimated clay of 15 to 25 percent.  It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe A and AB horizon have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam and contains 35 to 50 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam and contains 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 35 to 65 percent gravel."

The soil formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from tuff with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."
