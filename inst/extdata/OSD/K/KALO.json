  "OVERVIEW": "The Kalo series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from extrusive igneous rock.  Kalo soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard extrusive igneous rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 degrees to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about April 15 to November 10 (205 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about May 15 to October 20 (155 days).  The soil between depths of 10 to 22 inches is dry from about July 15 to October 20 (95 days).  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  The base saturation (by sum of cations) ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  Reaction of the solum is moderately or slightly acid.  Content of organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the surface 11 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay and 15 to 45 percent rock fragments.  Stones and cobbles range from 10 to 35 percent.  Gravel ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3.  The Bt horizon is very cobbly loam or very cobbly clay loam and average 20 to 32 percent clay with 5 to 12 percent more clay content than the A horizon and 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.  Stones range from 5 to 10 percent.  Cobbles range from 20 to 30 percent.  Gravels range from 10 to 15 percent."
