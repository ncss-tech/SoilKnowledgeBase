    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard extrusive igneous rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 degrees to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about April 15 to November 10 (205 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about May 15 to October 20 (155 days).  The soil between depths of 10 to 22 inches is dry from about July 15 to October 20 (95 days).  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  The base saturation (by sum of cations) ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  Reaction of the solum is moderately or slightly acid.  Content of organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the surface 11 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay and 15 to 45 percent rock fragments.  Stones and cobbles range from 10 to 35 percent.  Gravel ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3.  The Bt horizon is very cobbly loam or very cobbly clay loam and average 20 to 32 percent clay with 5 to 12 percent more clay content than the A horizon and 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.

Durst soils have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 40 degrees to 43 degrees F and are dry for 65 to 85 days.  Fraval soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches.  Jumbo and Sattley soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Klicker soils have over 40 percent silt in all horizons and are dry for 60 to 80 days.  Mulshoe soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 10YR hues in the A horizon.  Sapkin soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days after the summer solstics."
