  "OVERVIEW": "The Kinan series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and fan alluvium.  Kinan soils are on undulating plateaus and fan terraces.  They have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

Bluechief and Pagina soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Boreham and Nolava soils have more than 18 percent total clay in the control section. McCutchen soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR and are high in pyroclastic materials.  Moffat and Nakai soils have less gravel and have Bw horizons.  Nuahs soils have yellower hue.  Boreham, Nakoy, Nolava, Riemod, Teabrush, and Trook soils have soil temperatures less then 52 degrees F.  Kaito soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Riemod soils have accumulations of gypsum. In addition, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, 29) and have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year."
