Bluechief and Pagina soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Boreham and Nolava soils have more than 18 percent total clay in the control section. McCutchen soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR and are high in pyroclastic materials.  Moffat and Nakai soils have less gravel and have Bw horizons.  Nuahs soils have yellower hue.  Boreham, Nakoy, Nolava, Riemod, Teabrush, and Trook soils have soil temperatures less then 52 degrees F.  Kaito soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Riemod soils have accumulations of gypsum. In addition, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, 29) and have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kinan soils are on plateaus and fan terraces.  They formed in stratified eolian deposits and fan alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are l to l5 percent.  Elevations are 3500 to 6000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 11 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain and snow.  Mean annual air temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 180 days."
