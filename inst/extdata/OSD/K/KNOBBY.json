  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. GTS-RLT",
  "REVDATE": "02/2001",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Knobby series consists of shallow and very shallow, well and somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands. These soils are in glade areas and formed in thin loamy residuum from the underlying arenaceous dolomite and limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
