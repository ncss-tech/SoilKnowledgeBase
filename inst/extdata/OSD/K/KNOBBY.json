Slope gradients typically are 15 to 35 percent, but range from 2 to 50 percent.  Knobby soils formed in thin loamy residuum from the underlying arenaceous dolomite or limestone.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 45 inches."
