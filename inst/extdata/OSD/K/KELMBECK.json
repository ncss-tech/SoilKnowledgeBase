  "OVERVIEW": "The Kelmbeck series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from limestone and dolomite. These soils occur on hills, mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
