The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 55 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick and may include the upper part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is very stony loam or very cobbly silt loam and contains 5 to 30 percent stones, 10 to 35 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam with 35 to 40 percent clay.  It contains 15 to 40 percent stones, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 5 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bt3 horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

The soil formed in colluvium derived dominantly from basalt.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."
