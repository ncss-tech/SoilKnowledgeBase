  "OVERVIEW": "The Kekaha series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine-textured alluvium from soils weathered in basic igneous rock.  Kekaha soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains; and, low elevation mountain valleys; and, have slopes primarily of 2 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 584 millimeters (23 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.)",
