  "OVERVIEW": "The Knik series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess deposits overlying coarse textured glaciofluvial sediments.  Knik soils are on stream terraces, hills and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.  and the average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

The loess mantle is silt loam or very fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe E or EA horizons, when present, have moist value of 3 through 5; moist chroma from 1 through 3.\nThe A horizon, when present, has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3 and moist chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 4 or 5 and moist chroma from 3 through 6.\nThe 2Bw horizon, when present, has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 4 or 5 and moist chroma from 4 through 8.  Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 30 percent rounded gravel and cobble.\nThe 2BC horizon, when present, has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value from 3 through 5 and moist chroma from 4 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.  Coarse fragments range from 40 to 60 percent rounded gravel and cobble.\nThe 2C horizons have variegated colors.  Texture is sand, coarse sand or loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 70 percent rounded gravel and cobble."
