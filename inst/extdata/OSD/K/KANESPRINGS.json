  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanesprings series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, ignimbrite, and volcanic tuffs of intermediate composition.  The Kanesprings soils are on summits of plateaus and side slopes of low mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
