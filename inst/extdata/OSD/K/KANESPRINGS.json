    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kanesprings soils are on summits of plateaus and side slopes of mountains and hills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, ignimbrite and volcanic tuffs of intermediate composition.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 3,600 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; the mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 180 to 210 days."
