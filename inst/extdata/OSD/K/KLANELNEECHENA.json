  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of fibrous overpartially decomposed moss, twigs, and root fibers 8 to 15 inches thick. The loess cap ranges from less than 1 inch to three inches thick.   Depth to the permafrost ranges from 15 to 34 inches below the mineral soil surface 2 months after the summer solstice.  Texture of the control section includes coarse sand, sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.  Reaction is medium or slightly acid in the organic layers and slightly acid or neutral in the mineral soil.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma from 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or mucky silt loam.\nThe 2C horizon has moist hue from 10YR to 2.5Y; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klanelneechena soils formed in a thick organic mat overlying a thin loess mantle underlain by sandy alluvium and friable glacial outwash on broad lacustrine terraces and till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent and are typically plane to convex.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature varies from 23 to 27 degrees F."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly to poorly drained. Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic mat, moderate in the loess cap, rapid in the sandy material above the permafrost, and impermeable within the permafrost.  Runoff is very slow.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is destroyed by fire or clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level with subsequent lowering of the water table. Textural variability in the thawed substratums results in variability in permeability rates."

In these pedons, the permafrost and water table have dropped below the series control section.  This series reflects the nature of the thawed substratum material.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
