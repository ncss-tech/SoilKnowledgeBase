  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level to sloping glaciated uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The soil is formed mostly in clayey till and, in many pedons, in a thin underlying layer of loamy till that is underlain in turn by dolomite.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 762 mm (26 to 30 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Kolberg soils are associated with Kewaunee, Onaway, and Longrie soils. These soils often are associated in the landscape but cannot always be separated one from another by relief alone. Kewaunee and Onaway soils are on areas contiguous to the Kolberg series, where the glaciated deposits  are thicker and the dolomite is below the 40-inch series control section. Onaway soils are distinguished further by a lower clay and higher sand content in their control section. Longrie soils are associated with the Kolberg in the northernmost areas of their occurrence and are distinguished from Kolberg by having a spodic horizon in a bisequal profile and by having a higher sand and lower clay content in the control section."

Permeability is moderately slow or slow in the clayey till, moderate in the loamy till, and ranges from slow to moderate in the limestone."
