  "OVERVIEW": "The Kolberg series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a lithic contact with dolomite. These upland soils formed mostly in clayey till and, in many pedons, in a thin underlying layer of loamy till that is underlain in turn by dolomite. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Kolberg soils are associated with Kewaunee, Onaway, and Longrie soils. These soils often are associated in the landscape but cannot always be separated one from another by relief alone. Kewaunee and Onaway soils are on areas contiguous to the Kolberg series, where the glaciated deposits  are thicker and the dolomite is below the 40-inch series control section. Onaway soils are distinguished further by a lower clay and higher sand content in their control section. Longrie soils are associated with the Kolberg in the northernmost areas of their occurrence and are distinguished from Kolberg by having a spodic horizon in a bisequal profile and by having a higher sand and lower clay content in the control section."
