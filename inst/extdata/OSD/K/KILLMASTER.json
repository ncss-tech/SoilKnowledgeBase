  "OVERVIEW": "The Killmaster series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Killmaster soils formed in till and are on ground moraines and drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",

They depart from the concept of Solona series by having a glossic horizon and by forming in dense basal till."
