  "OVERVIEW": "The Knep series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits over residuum derived from calcareous siltstone, mudstone and sandstone. Knep soils are on escarpments, hills, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C.",
