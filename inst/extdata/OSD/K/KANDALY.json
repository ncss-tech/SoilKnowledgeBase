  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  Coarse fragments are absent throughout the control section, but a few scattered pebbles may be present on the surface.  The EC of the entire profile is less than 2 mmhos/cm.  All horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  The control section and surface are fine sand or loamy fine sand with 5 to 15 percent fines.  Reaction is typically mildly or moderately alkaline, but some pedons may be strongly alkaline below a depth of 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium percentage is typically about 0 to 5 percent but always less than 15 percent.  The soil is typically calcareous throughout but may be leached in the upper few inches.  Carbonates are disseminated throughout with no visible secondary accumulations."

Corlett soils are very strongly alkaline and have more than 15 percent ESP.  Costilla soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments.  Cotopaxi soils are noncalcareous to a depth of over 40 inches.  Space City soils have k horizons and are leached to 10 inches or more."

Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 100 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."

Teagulf and Terada soils are coarse-loamy and moderately deep to bedrock.  Westvaco soils have a natric horizon and are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  None of these soils is duned."
