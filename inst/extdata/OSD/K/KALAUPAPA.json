  "OVERVIEW": "The Kalaupapa series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash overlying pahoehoe lava.  Kalaupapa soils are on ash fields on pahoehoe lava flows and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1143 millimeters (45 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.)",
