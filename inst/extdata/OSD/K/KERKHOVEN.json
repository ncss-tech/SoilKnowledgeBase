  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon typically is 24 to 40 inches thick but ranges to 60 inches in some pedons.  Coarse fragments typically range from 1 to 8 percent by volume throughout, but the upper third of the series control section may not have coarse fragments.  The particle size control section averages more than 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam, clay loam, or silt loam.  Reaction is  slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It has few to many redoximorphic features in some to all parts. It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bkg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has redoximorphic features in all parts.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly has redoximorphic features in all parts.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It has less than 18 percent clay and typically more than 45 percent total sand.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The bulk density is 1.65 to 1.80 g/cc."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chamita, Cometcrik, Eagleton, Kovich, Lakepark, Lobe (T), Mannixlee, Marshbrook, Nythar and Welch soils. Chamita soils lack a cambic horizon below the mollic epipedon.  Cometcrik and Lobe soils have lithologic discontinuities in the series control section.  Kovich soils have a skeletal lithologic discontinuity in the particle size control section.  Eagleton and Nythar soils do not have free carbonates above a depth of 60 inches.  Lakepark soils have greater than 18 percent clay throughout the profile.  Mannixlee soils have over 15 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section.  Marshbrook soils have material weathered from bedrock in the lower third of the series control section with bulk density of less than 1.65 g/cc.  Welch soils have volcanic material in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kerkhoven soils are on lower footslopes and toeslopes of head and sideslopes on glacial moraines and till plains.  Slopes are plane or concave with 0 to 3 percent gradients.  These soils formed in loamy colluvium derived from glacial drift and underlying calcareous glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 29 inches.  Frost free days range from 120 to 160. Elevation above sea level ranges from 990 to 1950 feet."

Emrick and Ortonville soils are moderately well drained and are higher lying.  Friberg soils are poorly and very poorly drained soils and have argillic horizons."
