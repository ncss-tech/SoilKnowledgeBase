  "OVERVIEW": "The Kimberlina series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains and recent alluvial fans. These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and/or sedimentary rock sources. Slope is 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between the depths of 8 and 24 inches is dry all the time from April until mid-January and is moist in all parts for less than 60 consecutive days in the winter. Mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 67 degrees F. Rock fragment content is 0 to 25 percent and is usually less than 2 inches in diameter. Some pedons have few to common gypsum crystals, which occur where gypsum has been added to the soil by farmers.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/4 or 7/2. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 2.5Y 4/2. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam and may have a gravelly modifier. Clay content averages 5 to 20 percent. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 5 percent. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2,6/3, 6/4 or 7/2. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/3. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and may have a gravelly modifier. Clay content averages 10 to 18 percent. Carbonates are disseminated but some pedons also have segregated carbonates. Some pedons may not have carbonates in some parts of the profile but the 10 to 20 inch calcareous class control section is always calcareous. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. Organic matter is less than 0.5 percent and decreases regularly with increasing depth. Organic matter content is less than 0.2 percent below 49 inches depth.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, is similar to the C horizon and has weakly defined thick stratification of silt loam, loam, or sandy clay loam textures, but distinct thin stratification is not present. Some pedons have texture of loamy sand or loamy fine sand and do not have silt loam, loam or sandy clay loam."

Elkhills soils (MLRA 17), on uplifted fan remnants, have 5 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, have slopes of 9 to 50 percent and consistently have stratified textures in the lower part of the C horizon. Granitepass soils (MLRA 30), on alluvial fans, are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following convection storms, have gravel content of 30 to 80 percent  on the surface and 10 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and typically have a 2Btkb horizon. Herbel soils (MLRA 42), on alluvial fans and coalescent fan piedmonts, are intermittently moist for more than 20 days cumulative during July through September, have color hue of 7.5YR and 10YR and have Bk horizons. Machone soils (MLRA 30), on hills and rock pediments, are 20 to 40 inches deep to strongly weathered granitic rock. Seaman soils (MLRA 29, 30), on fan skirts and inset fans and fan aprons of the fan piedmont, are moist for a few brief intermittent periods following summer convection storms, have color hue of 7.5YR and 10YR and are formed in mixed alluvium with a component ofvolcanic ash or pyroclastic materials."
