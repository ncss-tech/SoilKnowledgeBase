Halii soils have ironstone-gibbsite pebbles in the A horizon and ferritic mineralogy and clay loam texture in the control section.  Kahanui soils have ironstone-gibbsite pebbles in the A horizon, ferritic mineralogy, and a discontinuous ironstone sheet in the B horizon.  Pooku soils contain many smooth, hardened ironstone-gibbsite pebbles in the A horizon, and have moderate structure and hue of 2.5YR or redder in the B horizon.  Puhi soils have a silty clay loam control section and lack nodules or sheets that contain more than 30 percent gibbsite."
