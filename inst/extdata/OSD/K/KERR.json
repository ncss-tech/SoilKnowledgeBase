These soils formed in mixed alluvium with a high chloritic schist content in the mineral clay.  Elevation is 3 to 50 meters.  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean precipitation is 1250 to 1780 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. The mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."

Ferndale soils have redoximorphic features at depths greater than 100 centimeters, have 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle size control section, and occur on high floodplain steps.  Madriver soils have greater than 15 percent by weight particles with diameters of .1 to .75, have redoximorphic features from 50 to 100 centimeters, and occur on natural levee positions.

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters. (Ap horizon)\n2. Episaturation - The soil is saturated from 31 to 109 and is also unsaturated from 109 to 152 centimeters below the saturated layer.  The zone of saturation is finer textured material above coarser material.\n3. Aquic conditions - between 31 and 44 centimeters below the mineral soil surface, with a silt loam texture, there are depletions with chroma of 2 or less and redoximorphic concentrations. (Ab horizon)\nThe series was proposed in The Soils of Western Humboldt, 1964.  The activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Type location was moved (2012) to current location to update the Typical Pedon and Range of Characteristics and to better represent the series concept. The classification was changed at that time to reflect changes in the 11th edition of Taxonomy.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNSSL Pedon No. 08N0580, Humboldt County, CA.\nNasis User Pedon ID: 04CA605064\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th edition.  10th Edition classification was coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, acid, isomesic Cumulic Humaquepts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
