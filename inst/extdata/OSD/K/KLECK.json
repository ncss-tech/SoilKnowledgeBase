  "OVERVIEW": "The Kleck series consists of well drained soils that are shallow over consolidated lake sediments.  The soils formed in lacustrine sediments influenced by eolian sand or loess.  The Kleck soils are on basin-floor remnants, lake plains and lake-plain terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
