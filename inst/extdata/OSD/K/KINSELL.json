The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. These soils receive some additional run-on moisture from flooding. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
