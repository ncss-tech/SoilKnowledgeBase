(The Kinsell series is in the ustic aridic moisture regime).  In addition, Kuma soils have buried paleosols within 20 inches.\nLazarus soils do not contain visible secondary calcium carbonates in the substratum.\nZepol soils have small amounts of volcanic ash in the coarse silt and fine sand fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kinsell soils are on flood plains of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone,  and shale of the Triassic Age Chinle Formation. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. These soils receive some additional run-on moisture from flooding. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Arojomil soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Chilerojo soils are fine-loamy, very deep to a densic contact, and occur on footslopes. Clovis soils have a calcic horizon and occur on backslopes and footslopes. Frajillo soils are loamy, are shallow to hard sandstone, and are on backslopes and shoulders."
