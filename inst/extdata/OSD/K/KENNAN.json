Combined thickness of E/B and B/E, where both are present, ranges from (8 to 35 inches.)\nBt1--26 to 40 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common faint dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; thick brown (10YR 5/3) silt and very fine sand coatings on vertical faces of peds, mainly in upper 6 inches of horizon; few fine roots; about 10 percent pebbles and 2 percent cobbles by volume; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.\nBt2--40 to 48 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common clay bridging between sand grains; few fine roots; about 10 percent pebbles and 2 percent cobbles by volume; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 85 inches.  The solum ranges from neutral to very strongly acid.  The C horizon is strongly acid to neutral.  Volume of pebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the Ap, A, E/B, B/E, and Bt1, 5 to 20 percent in Bt2, and 5 to 25 percent in the C horizon.  Volume of coarse fragments larger than 3 inches in size ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 2 through 5; and chroma of 0 through 3.  The lower value colors are typical of A horizons.  The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Stony or bouldery phases are recognized.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon, but typically it is too thin to be diagnostic.  Where present, it has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 3 through 5; and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nWhere present, the E horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Colors of 4/3, 4/4, or 5/3 have value, dry, of 7 or more.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nKennan soils have E/B or B/E horizons, or both.  These horizons have tongues of E material between thin columnlike upward extensions of Bt or wholly surrounding small isolated remnants of Bt horizon.  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon and the Bt part has color and texture like the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt1 horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It typically is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The Bt2 horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogues.  The control section averages between 5 and 18 percent clay.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.  In some pedons, there are areas of stratified sand and gravel in the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alban, Amery, Freeon, Langlade, Marathon, Rosholt, and Scott Lake series in the same family. Alban soils do not have coarse fragments.  Amery soils have a higher bulk density and a slower permeability.  Freeon soils have mottles in the solum and a slower permeability within a depth of 40 inches. Langlade soils have more silt in that part of the argillic horizon between a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Marathon soils have more coarse fragments in that part of the lower part of the argillic horizon within depths of 40 inches or less and coarse fragments are mostly of granitic lithology.  Rosholt and Scott Lake soils have thinner sola.  In addition, Scott Lake soils have mottles in the lower part of the solum."

Kennan soils formed mostly in sandy loam or loamy sand glacial till with less than a 30 inch mantle of other loamy deposits.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 37 inches."

The poorly drained, coarse-loamy Cable soils are in nearby depressional areas.  On nearby slopes, where the glacial drift is more gravelly and cobbly, are the somewhat excessively drained Elderon soils and the well drained Keweenaw soils.  On adjacent outwash areas are the well drained Rosholt soils.  In some nearly level areas are the somewhat poorly drained Hatley soils."
