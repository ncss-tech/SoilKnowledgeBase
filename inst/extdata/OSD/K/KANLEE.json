Alexander and Ayoub soils lack Cr horizons and are moderately deep over basalt.  Cloudless soils are very deep.  Cloud Rim soils have a solum thickness of 127 to 152 cm.  Isbell, Maple Mountain, and Paynecreek soils are over 100 cm deep to bedrock.  Ticino soils lack coarse sands in the fine earth fraction and are dry for more than 70 days in the moisture control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kanlee soils are on mountainsides, hillsides and terraces at elevations of 4,600 to 7,000 feet.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from schist, gneiss, quartz monzonite, granite or related coarse-grained intrusive acid igneous rock.  Slopes range from 1 to 55 percent.  The climate is subhumid.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 25 inches, and average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 55 to 100 days."
