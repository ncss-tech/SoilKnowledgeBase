  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanlee series consists of moderately deep to soft weathered bedrock, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from schist, gneiss, quartz monzonite, granite or other coarse-grained intrusive acid igneous rock.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Kanlee soils are on hillsides, mountainsides, and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 55 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
