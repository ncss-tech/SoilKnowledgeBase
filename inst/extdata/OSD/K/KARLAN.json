  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 38 degrees to 43 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 56 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The mollic epipdon ranges from 16 to 32 inches thick.  The solum includes up to 20 percent rock fragments by volume, and ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Between depths of 10 inches and the underlying bedrock, the soil contains between 18 and 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser, and averages 5 to 20 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon is commonly silt loam, but includes few angular pebbles or channery fragments, angular cobblestones or flagstones, and/or stones.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Clay increases over the A horizon ranges from 0 to 2.5 percent.  This horizon is commonly silt loam but ranges to loam.  Weak or moderate bleacbed silty coatings and weak organic stains are present on the peds in some pedons.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Adel, Bullrey, and Pavohroo soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and lack strong lime accumulations.  Gallatin, Idmon, Kennally, and Lamphier soils are deeper than 40 inches to sand and gravel, and lack B horizons.  Leavittville, Mundos, and Osmund soils lack bedrock within depth of 60 inches.  Winevada soils lack Cca horizons."

Elevations are 5,500 to 7,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid continental which is relatively dry in mid- and late summer with cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 50 to 80 days."
