  "OVERVIEW": "The Knowles series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a lithic contact with dolomite bedrock. These soils formed in a loess mantle and in the underlying loamy till are on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
