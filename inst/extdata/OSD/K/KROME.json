  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "9/91",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Krome series consists of very shallow, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils over limestone.  They formed by scarification of outcrops of oolitic limestone, and the loamy residuum that partially covers the limestone and fills the many cavities or solution holes.  These soils are on broad areas of the Miami Ridge.  Slopes are predominantly 0 to 2 percent, but range to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually rockplowed or scarified annually.  The limestone has less than 38 percent loss by the Los Angeles abrasion test.  Reaction is mildly alkaline through moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalence ranges from 40 to 80 percent of the fine earth fraction in the soil, and from 92 percent or more in the limestone.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR value of 3,  and chroma of 2 or 3 moist; and hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.   Texture is very gravelly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam or their extremely gravelly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam or their extremely gravelly analogues.  Content of limestone fragments predominantly is 35 to 60 percent by volume, but ranges to 70 percent.  The fragments range from 2mm to 7.5cm in diameter.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 to 6; or value of 5, and chroma of 8; or hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.  The material in solution holes have dark gray or very dark gray pockets of silty clay loam or silty clay in root channels."

Gladeville, a strongly competing series in a similar family, has 35 percent or more clay by weight, and has mixed mineralogy and is thermic.   Lindgren is sandy skeletal.  Chekika soils have dry color value greater than 5.5 and are somewhat poorly drained."

Biscayne, Pennsuco, and Perrine soils are composed of limnic (marl) materials and are poorly drained.  Chekika soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Hialeah and Opalocka occur in scarified areas and in a complex with Rock Outcrop.  Opalocka soils are sandy.  Lindgren soils are sandy skeletal.  Matecumbe are organic soils."
