  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock commonly is 60 inches or more but ranges to 40 inches in some pedons. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. Kahler soils are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches. Thickness of the solum is 20 to 60 inches. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick and contains 10 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, and a weighted average of less than 35 percent rock fragments. It is moderately acid to neutral throughout. Oi horizons are present in many areas. Base saturation by sum is less then 75 percent in some part of the solum between 10 and 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and 2 or 3 dry. It is ashy silt loam or ashy loam and has 0 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones and clay content is 15 to 27 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, ashy clay loam or ashy silty clay loam, gravelly ashy loam, gravelly ashy clay loam or gravelly ashy silty clay loam. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones and clay content is 20 to 30 percent. In some pedons, gravel may range to 40 percent below 40 inches.\nThe 2C horizons, when present, are loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay loam and has 10 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and clay content is 18 to 35 percent.\nThe 3C horizon (unweathered ash layer) is not present in all pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buford, Derr (T), Hall Ranch, Highvalley, McGarr, Minam and Myzel (T) series. Buford soils are similar and are defined as 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact; a 2Bwb horizon is present over the bedrock with 40 to 50 percent clay. The lithic bedrock substratum phase of Kahler should be correlated to Buford. Derr and McGarr soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Hall Ranch soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Highvalley soils have 50 to 75 percent base saturation, are dry for 45 to 75 consecutive days and have vitrandic properties to a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Minam soils have base saturation of over 75 percent, are 20 to 36 inches to a contrasting 2C horizon with hue of 5YR and 25 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones, and have 20 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the A horizon.  Myzel series have redox features at depths of 30 to 48 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kahler soils are on back slopes of plateaus, canyons, hills, and mountains. Elevations range from 2,000 to 6,000 feet. Slope are 2 to 90 percent. The soil formed in loess and ash mixed with colluvium weathered mainly from basic igneous and metamorphic rocks. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 45 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F, and the mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F. The frost-free period is 20 to 100 days."

Many areas with slopes of less than 15 percent have been cleared and produce dryland hay and grain, or irrigated crops. The native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, pinegrass and elk sedge."
