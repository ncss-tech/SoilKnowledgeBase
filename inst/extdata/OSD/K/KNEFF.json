Depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between October and May in normal years. The soil is saturated in one or more layers within 30 inches of the surface, for one month or more in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow."
