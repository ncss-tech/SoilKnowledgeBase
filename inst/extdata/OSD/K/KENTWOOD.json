  "OVERVIEW": "The Kentwood series consists of very deep, well drained, soils. These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in mixed alluvial loess over loamy Coastal Plain alluvium on terraces of late Pleistocene age. These soils formed in a silty mantle, less than 4 feet thick, and the underlying loamy sediments. They are on stream terraces in the Southern Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
