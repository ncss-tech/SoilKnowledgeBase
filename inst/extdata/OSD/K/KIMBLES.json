  "OVERVIEW": "The Kimbles series consists of very deep, poorly drained lacustrine soils formed in alluvial deposits on the banks of meandering streams within glacial lakebeds. The soils formed from sandy and silty fluvial deposits derived from adjacent glaciolacustrine materials. Permeability is moderate to moderately slow in the solum and moderately rapid to rapid in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 70 inches. Rock fragments are less than 5 percent in the solum, but range from 0 to 60 percent in the substratum. The rock fragments consist of rounded and subrounded sandstone pebbles and cobbles. Pebbles are make-up the largest percentage averaging around 65 percent of the total rock fragment fraction. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from extremely acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 0 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, or silt. Some pedons have 1 to 3 inch dark A horizons with similar hue and chroma as the Ap horizon, but with values of 2 or 3.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 to 6. The matrix colors of the B horizons are usually varigated and gleyed. It is loam, silt loam, or silt with some pedons having transitions to C horizons of sandier textures.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or 5GY, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand and is commonly stratified or varved with different sand sizes and/or gravels and cobbles. Discontinuous 1 or 2 inch buried organic layers thought to be of the Pleistocene age are common, and that can color the surrounding strata with hues as red as 2.5YR."
