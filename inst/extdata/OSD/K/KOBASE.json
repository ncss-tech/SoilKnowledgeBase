  "OVERVIEW": "The Kobase series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale and sandstone, or glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  They are on till plains, lake plains, stream terraces, alluvial fans, drainageways, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
