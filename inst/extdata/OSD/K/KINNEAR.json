  "OVERVIEW": "The Kinnear series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

The need for documentation in support of a Bw horizon, and not a Bt horizon (or a diagnostic argillic horizon), is recognized and should be investigated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
