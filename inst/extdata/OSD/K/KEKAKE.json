  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kekake soils are on upper elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from 1067 to 2133 meters (3500 to 7000 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 508 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1016 to 1778 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 57 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"

    "content": "REMARKS: Soil moisture - usually moist, but dry in some or all parts totaling 90 or more days during the months of October through April in most years (Ustic moisture regime).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nSapric soil materials - from 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (Oa horizon).\nLithic contact - at 13 centimeters (5 inches) (2R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NASIS Pedon User ID 93HI002018. NSSL sample S97HI-001-011.  The lab data is borderline Lithic Haplustands, but the typical concept of Kekake is  Lithic Ustifolists.\nEdit Log: 11/3/99 Classification revised due to changes in Soil Taxonomy.  Old Classification: Euic, isomesic Lithic Tropofolists.  Type location moved to a representative site.  Competing series have been updated.  MRK 2/6/08 Minor edits made.
