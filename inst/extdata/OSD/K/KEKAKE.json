  "STATES": "HI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kekake series consists of very shallow, moderately well  drained organic soils.  These soils formed in organic material mixed with minor amounts of basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 890 millimeters (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.)",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kekake soils are on upper elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from 1067 to 2133 meters (3500 to 7000 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 508 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1016 to 1778 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 57 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
