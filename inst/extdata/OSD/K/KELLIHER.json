    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 1 to 10 percent, by volume. The sand content in the lower third of the series control section has less than 45 percent sand and more than 18 percent clay.\nSome pedons have an O horizon 1 to 3 inches thick. The O horizon is partially to well decomposed organic matter from remains of trees, shrubs, sedges, and forest floor flora. It has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 1 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Dry color values are greater than 5.5. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have BE or B/E horizons. The eluvial part is less than 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. The particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 30 to 45 percent sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is typically loam or clay loam, but thin subhorizons of fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam are in some pedons.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kelliher soils have convex and linear slopes on gently undulating ground moraines. They formed in calcareous, loamy glacial till of Late Wisconsin Age. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 28 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation is 1,000 to 1,700 feet above sea level."

Well drained Nebish soils have convex slopes and are on higher lying positions. Somewhat poorly drained Beltrami soils are on slightly convex to plane surfaces on lower positions. Poorly drained Talmoon soils are on concave to plane surfaces on lower positions. Very poorly drained Bluffton and Hamre soils are in concave depressions."
