Of these, only the Cateache, Culleoka, Frondorf, Loudonville, Oatlands, and Spriggs series have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of less than 102 centimeters (40 inches). Cateache soils have a hue of 5YR or redder in the subsoil and formed in residuum from interbedded siltstone and shale. Culleoka and Frondorf soils do not have rounded or subrounded quartzite pebbles in the series control section and have a lithic contact. Loudonville soils have a mean annual soil temperature of\nless than 13 degrees C (55 degrees F) and have a lithic contact. Oatlands soils formed in Triassic and Jurassic sandstone and conglomerate and typically have a lithic contact. Spriggs soils have saprolite and/or hornblende lithologies immediately below the paralithic contact."
