    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klauspeak soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
