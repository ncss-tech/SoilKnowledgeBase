  "OVERVIEW": "The Klauspeak series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Klauspeak soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
