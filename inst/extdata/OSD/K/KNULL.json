  "OVERVIEW": "The Knull series is a member of the fine-silty, mixed, mesic family of Xerollic Natrargids. Typically, Knull soils have grayish brown A horizons, brown and very pale brown heavy silt loam Bt horizons containing more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium, and strongly calcareous silt loam Ccasa horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 55 degrees F. The soils are usually dry but are moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches for about 60 to 70 days during the spring and early summer. The sola range in thickness from 6 to 18 inches. Depth to the calcic horizon is 8 to 20 inches. The natric horizon is predominantly silt loam and averages 18 and 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand. The A horizon has value of 5 or 6.5 dry or 3 to 4.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. However, it is not both darker than value of 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, both broken and crushed, when mixed to a depth of 7 inches. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline (pH 6.7 to 8.0). Tillage often mixes the A horizon and part of the Bt horizon. Where cultivate, a thin Bt horizon is in most pedons. The Bt horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 to 4.5 moist. It has moderate or weak prismatic or columnar structure that parts to moderate or strong subangular or angular blocky structure. This horizon is neutral to strongly alkaline (pH 6.8 to 8.6). All or part of the Bt horizon is slightly or moderately saline and contains 15 to 40 percent exchangeable sodium.  Where undisturbed, the A and the upper part or al of the Bt horizons are noncalcareous. The organic matter content of the upper 15 inches averages more than 1 percent if the weighted average sand/clay ration for this depth is 1.0 or less. The Cca horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It contains about 15 to 28 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. This horizon is mildly to strongly alkaline (pH 7.7 to 8.8), slightly to strongly saline, and contains 20 to 60 percent exchangeable sodium.\nCOMPETING SERIES AND ThEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Brunt, Calabar, Mellor, and Sebree series. Brunt and Calabar soils have a mean annual soil temperature colder than 47 degrees F. Mellor soils are moderately or strongly calcareous in the A and B2t horizon. Sebree soils have a duripan."

The soils formed in deep loess or silty alluvium.  The climate is semiarid and has dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1.5 to 4 feet of snowfall.
