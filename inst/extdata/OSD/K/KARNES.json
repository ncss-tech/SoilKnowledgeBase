  "OVERVIEW": "The Karnes series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from limestone. These soils occur on nearly level to moderately sloping footslopes on hillslopes or stream terraces on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about degrees 18.3 C (degrees 65 F).",
