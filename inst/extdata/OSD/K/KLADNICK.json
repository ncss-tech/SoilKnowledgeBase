The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and fall. Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 25 inches. The particle-size control section averages 70 to 90 percent sand in the fine-earth fraction and 45 to 65 percent rock fragments by volume. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Texture is ashy sandy loam, cobbly ashy fine sandy loam or very stony ashy sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist. Texture is ashy sandy loam, cobbly ashy fine sandy loam, or very stony ashy sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, chroma 2 to 4 when dry or moist. It is gravelly ashy sandy loam, ashy sandy loam, cobbly ashy fine sandy loam, or cobbly ashy sandy loam. Reaction is neutral or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has a value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, chroma 2 to 4 when dry or moist. It is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam or extremely gravelly loamy sand.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kladnick soils are on outwash terraces, fans and toe slopes. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in glacial outwash, alluvium and colluvium, with a mantle of volcanic ash. Elevation is 1,800 to 2,600 feet. These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 75 inches. The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 130 to 175 days."
