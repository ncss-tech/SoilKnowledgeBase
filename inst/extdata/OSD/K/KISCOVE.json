  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kiscove series consists of shallow and very shallow well drained soils that formed in material weathered from metamorphic rock. Kiscove soils are on hills and mountains with slopes of 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (230 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.(13 degrees C.).",
