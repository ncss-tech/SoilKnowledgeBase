  "OVERVIEW": "The Korchea series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in stratified alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces and have slope ranging from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 15 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 18 and 35 percent clay and between 15 to 40 percent fine sand and coarser.  The soil typically contains carbonates to the surface, but the upper few inches of some pedons do not effervesce.  Some pedons contain one or more thin dark colored strata.  The decrease in organic carbon is irregular with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon typically has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, but 5Y is in the range, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Layers of coarser or finer textures are in some pedons at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

The soils formed in stratified loamy alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 19 inches.  Precipitation range up to 20 inches in the foothills of the mountains.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

All but Havrelon and Lohler soils have mollic epipedons.  In addition, Lohler soils are fine textured.  Farland, Manning, Parshall, Wyola, Stady and Tally soils are on higher lying terraces.   Frazer, Havrelon and Lohler soils are on flood plains.  Shambo soils are on higher lying terraces.  Straw and Velva soils are on similar low terraces."
