Chenega soils do not have spodic horizons, are sandy-skeletal, and are on floodplains. Jakolof soils are on stream terraces. Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic matter accumulated in depressions. Seldovia soils occur on similar landscapes or in complex with Kasitsna soils. Tutka soils have bedrock within 20 inches and are on glacially abraded bedrock ridges."
