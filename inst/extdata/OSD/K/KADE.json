  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 35 to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 50 to 57 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist.  The organic matter content appears to decrease irregularly with increasing depth.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has few to common fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and 4/4 mottles.  This horizon is stratified silty clay, silt loam, clay loam, and very fine sandy loam and averages over 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  A water table is at 1 to 3 feet in depth in most years."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium from limestone, sandstone, and shale.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 80 days.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F."

Osote soils have B horizons with less than 35 percent clay, lack water tables within a depth of 40 inches, and lack mottles."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Aquic Cryofluvents.  They have been reclassified as Typic Cryaquents because of moist chroma of 2 or less in the matrix of the C horizon between 18 and 36 cm below the surface.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
