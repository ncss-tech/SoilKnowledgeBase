  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kenusky soils are on terrace remnants in mountainous areas of the Coast Range at elevations of 500 to 1,200 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium under a cool, moist climate. The mean July temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is 35 to 37 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 75 inches. The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days. The soils are on the Seven Devils geomorphic surface."

Bacona and Vernonia soils are well drained and have a fine-silty argillic horizon. Mayger soils are somewhat poorly drained and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a claypan. Trask soils are well drained, loamy-skeletal, and 20- to 40- inches deep to siltstone or shale."
