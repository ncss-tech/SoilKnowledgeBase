  "OVERVIEW": "The Kenusky series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Kenusky soils are on terrace remnants in mountainous areas and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
