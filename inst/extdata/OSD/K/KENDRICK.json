    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 60 or more inches thick. It is very strongly acid to medium acid in all horizons. Weathered phosphatic pebbles and iron concretions, 2 to 10 mm in size, range from 0 to 3 percent in the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The E horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nSome pedons have a sandy loam BE horizon with the same color range as the E horizon.  It is 0 to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8; or hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Sandy clay is included in the lower part.  In some pedons the lower part is mottled with gray and red.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 with many or common, medium and coarse mottles of stronger chromas.  It is sandy clay loam or sandy loam, with thin and thick lenses and pockets of coarser or finer textured material."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known competing series in the same family.  Other closely related competing series are the Hague series.  Hague soils have 35 percent or more base saturation in the lower argillic horizon and decrease in clay content by more than 20 percent of the maximum within depths of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kendrick soils occur on nearly level to sloping uplands in the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils have formed in thick beds of loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, average annual precipitation is about 59 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F."

Arredondo soils have sandy epipedons 40 to 80 inches thick.  Blichton and Kanapaha soils are on lower elevations and are poorly drained.  In addition, Kanapaha soils have sandy epipedons more than 40 inches thick.  Gainesville soils are on about the same elevations and have a loamy sand texture to depths of 80 or more inches. Lochloosa and Sparr soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Zuber soils have a clayey argillic horizon within depths of 20 inches."
