  "OVERVIEW": "The Kiln series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from limestone.  Kiln soils are on uplands, ridges and mountains and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The solum is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is stony loam, stony silt loam or stony clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is stony or cobbly silty clay loam or clay loam.  In some pedons the rock fragments are coated with lime on the under side."
