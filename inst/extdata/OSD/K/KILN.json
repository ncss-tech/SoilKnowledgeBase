  "OVERVIEW": "The Kiln series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from limestone.  Kiln soils are on uplands, ridges and mountains and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
