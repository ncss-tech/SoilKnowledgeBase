  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kamela soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains. Elevations are 3,000 to 6,200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt with some influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface. The climate is characterized by cold and moist winters and warm and dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
