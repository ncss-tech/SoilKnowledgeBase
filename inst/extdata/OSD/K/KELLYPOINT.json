  "OVERVIEW": "The Kellypoint series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt.  Kellypoint soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
