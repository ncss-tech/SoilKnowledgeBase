  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanaskat series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in weathered volcanic ash, colluvium, and residuum from extrusive igneous rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Kanaskat soils are on foothill backslopes at  elevations of 1,000 to 1,700 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature  is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact with bedrock is 55 to 72 inches.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 75 percent rock fragments by volume. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F.  Reaction is moderately acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry,  and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Some pedons have weakly developed  E horizons.\nThe 2Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist.  It is sandy loam or loam modified by 30 to 60 percent rock fragments and 0 to 10 percent weathered hard cinders.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry.  It is sandy loam or loam modified by 40 to 60 percent rock fragments of pebble and cobble size.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist, 2 through 6 dry.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam modified by from 45 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nIn some pedons the rock fragments in all horizons are mainly fine pebbles."

All of these soils lack the mantle of volcanic ash.  In addition, Ahl, Beausite, Ogarty, Pickett, and Squires soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Barnhardt and Husum soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days.  Heisler soils are 35 to 55 percent phyllite fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lyre soils have a 2C horizon of sandy-skeletal material in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Neer, Swinomish, and Vanzandt soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Tunnel soils have a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the spodic horizon."

Kanaskat soils formed in weathered volcanic ash and colluvium from a wide variety of extrusive igneous rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash. The climate is maritime with cool dry summers and mild winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 80 inches.  The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F. The frost-free season (32 degrees F) is 140 to 170 days."
