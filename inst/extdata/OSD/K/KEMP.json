  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of recent sediments to the buried soil with an argillic horizon with or without an Ab horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral in the recent sediments, strongly through slightly acid in the upper part of the buried argillic horizon, and primarily medium acid through neutral in the lower part.  Rarely, the lower part of the solum ranges to\nmoderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, ranging from dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and various shades of brown through light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  When moist values are less than 3.5, this horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  Few to common fine mottles of light brownish gray, dark grayish brown, or grayish brown are in some pedons.  This horizon is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon is light gray (10YR 7/2), brown (10YR 5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR\n7/3), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4).  Few to common fine mottles of gray, brown, and yellow are present in some pedons.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Strata of these textures range from few to common.\nThe Ab horizon is not recognizable in all pedons.  Where present,\nit is 1 or 2 values lower than the recent deposits.  It is fine\nsandy loam, loam, or rarely sandy clay loam.  The upper part of\nthe buried argillic horizon is either distinctly mottled in shades\nof brown, yellow, and gray or it has matrix colors of brown (10YR 5/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1) with common fine and medium mottles of brown, yellow, and gray.  The lower part is distinctly mottled with shades of gray, brown, and yellow in hues\nof 7.5YR through 2.5Y.  The buried argillic horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay."

Adler and Collins soils have textures of silt loam with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the\ncontrol section.  Bunyan, Congaree, and Varro soils are not\nsaturated above 40 inches at some seasons in most years.  Cartecay and Thenas soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Iuka soils are acid and have siliceous mineralogy.  Marietta and Nahatche soils have cambic horizons.  In addition, Nahatche soils are saturated with water in the upper 20 inches."

They formed\nin recently deposited loamy alluvium 20 to 40 inches thick which overlie a buried soil, also formed in alluvium.  Mean annual temperature near the type location is about 66 degrees F., and Thornthwaite P-E indices are about 50 to 70."
