These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section from 10 inches to the bedrock contact has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1 to 2 percent, phosphate retention of 40 to 85 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 10 to 20 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 15 to 25 percent field estimated clay and 30 to 55 percent sand.  Base saturation is less than 10 percent by ammonium acetate throughout the profile.\nThe E horizon (albic materials)has value of 5 or 6 moist and 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 20 meq/100g of extractable aluminum.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter.  NaF pH is 7.0 to 8.5.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 7.5YR moist, 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2, 4, or 6 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.
