  "OVERVIEW": "The Knorr series consists of moderately deep to hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 190 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
