  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Depth to bedrock typically is 20 to 30 inches, but ranges to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches and extends into the Bt horizon.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 28 inches.  Glass shards are throughout and average 10 to 35 percent of the volume.  CEC ranges from 125 meq./100g of clay in the upper part of the solum to over 550 meq/100g of clay in the bedrock.  The 15-bar clay-water ratio exceeds 1.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt and Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They typically are silty clay loam or silt loam averaging between 25 and 35 percent clay, but some pedons are loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Few to common fragments of siltstone of 1 to 10 mm are in the lower Bt and Bw horizons of most pedons.  Some pedons have BC horizons.\nThe Bk horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam.  Fragments of siltstone make up 5 to 40 percent by volume and are coated with carbonates in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have C horizons.\nThe Cr horizon is siltstone bedrock.  It is soft and easily dug with a spade.  It fractures into plates and fragments 1/4 to 3 inches thick.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Alliance, Beauvais, Cale, Keith, Norka, and Vale series do not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Mace soils are moderately deep over Ogallala material.  Agar soils are dry for a shorter period.  Duroc soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick.   The Huggins, Kube, and Savo soils are fine textured.  Rosebud soils are fine-loamy.  The Keota soils do not have a mollic epipedon or argillic horizon.  Shena soils have bedrock at depths less than 17 inches."

The soils formed in silty residuum weathered mainly from siltstone or very fine grained sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F; mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches."

Epping soils have siltstone at depths less than 20 inches.  Huggins, Keith, Kube, and Shena soils are in similar landscapes.  Wanblee and Wortman soils are on nearly level nearby landscapes and have a natric horizon."
