  "OVERVIEW": "The Koshare series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Koshare soils are on toeslopes of ridges, hills, and treads of fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
