  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Birds and Southwest series. Birds soils do not have a buried soil within the series control section. Southwest soils formed recent alluvium overlying glaciofluvial deposits or glaciolacustrine deposits in depressions on moraines, till plains, and outwash plains in MLRAs 98 and 111."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Killbuck soils are on level or in depressional areas on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The areas are now flood plains, but some were shallow in post-glacial times. The regolith in the upper part of the profile is recent alluvium from glaciated uplands. The buried soil is of alluvial or lacustrine origin. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1092 mm (33 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

Algiers soils have chroma of 3 in part of the recent alluvium and are fine-loamy. Holly soils lack a buried dark colored A horizon and are fine-loamy. Sloan soils lack the overlying light colored recent alluvium and are fine-loamy. Wallkill soils are underlain by buried soils consisting of organic materials. The well drained Chagrin soils, the moderately well drained Lobdell soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Orrville soils are fine-loamy. They are on higher topographic positions or along higher gradient streams. Bogart, Chili, Conotton, Fitchville, Glenford, Lorain, Luray, Mentor, Montgomery, Sebring, and Wheeling soils are on nearby terraces and formed in outwash or lacustrine material."
