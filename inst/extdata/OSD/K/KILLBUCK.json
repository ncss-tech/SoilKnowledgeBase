  "STATES": "OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Killbuck series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 inches) of recent alluvium over a buried dark colored soil. These soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The areas are now flood plains, but some were shallow in post-glacial times. The regolith in the upper part of the profile is recent alluvium from glaciated uplands. The buried soil is of alluvial or lacustrine origin. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1092 mm (33 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F)."

Algiers soils have chroma of 3 in part of the recent alluvium and are fine-loamy. Holly soils lack a buried dark colored A horizon and are fine-loamy. Sloan soils lack the overlying light colored recent alluvium and are fine-loamy. Wallkill soils are underlain by buried soils consisting of organic materials. The well drained Chagrin soils, the moderately well drained Lobdell soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Orrville soils are fine-loamy. They are on higher topographic positions or along higher gradient streams. Bogart, Chili, Conotton, Fitchville, Glenford, Lorain, Luray, Mentor, Montgomery, Sebring, and Wheeling soils are on nearby terraces and formed in outwash or lacustrine material."
