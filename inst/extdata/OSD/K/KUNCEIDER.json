  "OVERVIEW": "The Kunceider series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and pumice over residuum derived from basalt. Kunceider soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C.",

Henkle soils are ashy-skeletal with andic soil properties, shallow to lithic contacts, have a xeric moisture regime, and occur on adjacent forested lava plains. Wanoga soils are ashy with andic soil properties, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, have a xeric moisture regime, and occur on adjacent forested lava plains.
