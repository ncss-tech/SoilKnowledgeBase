  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kunceider soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus. These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over residuum derived from basalt. The volcanic ash source is ancestral Mt. Mazama (Crater Lake caldera). Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1.604 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."

Bonnick soils are ashy, very deep, and occur on adjacent nearly level lake terraces. Fort Rock soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, very deep, and occur on adjacent nearly level lake terraces. Henkle soils are ashy-skeletal with andic soil properties, shallow to lithic contacts, have a xeric moisture regime, and occur on adjacent forested lava plains. Wanoga soils are ashy with andic soil properties, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, have a xeric moisture regime, and occur on adjacent forested lava plains. Wegert soils are ashy and moderately deep to lithic contacts."
