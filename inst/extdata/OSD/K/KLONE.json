The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 130 inches. Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F., average July temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 140 to 200 days."
