These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The argillic horizon averages 35 to 45 percent clay. Organic carbon to 4 inches is estimated to be 1 to 2 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon, when present, has value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B/E and Bt/E horizon have value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kewach soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  These soils formed in glacial lake sediments with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,300 to 2,000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Anglen soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick.  Cedonia soils lack an argillic horizon, are fine-silty and mesic.  Hartill soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Lakesol soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 12 inches thick and are coarse-silty and lack an argillic horizon."
