  "OVERVIEW": "The Kewach series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial lake sediments with a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash. These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The argillic horizon averages 35 to 45 percent clay. Organic carbon to 4 inches is estimated to be 1 to 2 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.
