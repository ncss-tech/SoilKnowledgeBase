  "OVERVIEW": "The Kutler series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite.  Kutler soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from about 10 to 16 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 35 to 80 percent and are mostly 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  The fine earth fraction of the control section ranges in clay from 10 to 25 percent.  The hue of the profile is 5YR through 10YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6."
