Besner and Hicota soils have a solum thicker than 80 inches and do not have saturated layers within a depth of 40 inches. In addition Hicota soils have an argillic horizon with hue redder than 10YR. Alazan, Kurth, and Penning soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. In addition, Alazan and Penning soils have aquic conditions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Moten soils have a solum thicker than 60 inches."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches. Annual frost-free rainfall ranges from 25 to 30 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 230 to 245. The elevation ranges from 250 to 500 feet above sea level. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 72 to 82."
