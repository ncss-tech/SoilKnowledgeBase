    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 15 to 35 inches. The weighted average clay content in the particle-size control section ranges from 9 to 17 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt/E horizon has matrix colors in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. Redox concentrations or masses in shades of red or brown range from none to common. Texture is mainly fine sandy loam but ranges to loam or sandy clay loam in the lower part. Albic materials (E) make up 15 to 50 percent by volume. Typically, albic materials increase with depth and make up more than 50 percent in the lower part of some pedons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2C/Bt horizon. where present is weakly consolidated sandstone or mudstone with clay coatings an films in shades of brown or gray along cleavage planes. Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon is weakly consolidated sandstone or mudstone, or it is stratified with layers of both materials. Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam. The clay content ranges from 25 to 38 percent with 4 to 35 percent silt. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Alazan, Besner, Hicota, Kurth, Moten, and Penning series are in closely related families. Besner and Hicota soils have a solum thicker than 80 inches and do not have saturated layers within a depth of 40 inches. In addition Hicota soils have an argillic horizon with hue redder than 10YR. Alazan, Kurth, and Penning soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. In addition, Alazan and Penning soils have aquic conditions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Moten soils have a solum thicker than 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Keltys soils are on slightly convex very gently sloping broad interstream divides and on moderately sloping ridge and side slope positions along drainageways. They formed in loamy coastal plain sediments over the Caddell, Manning, and Yegua geologic formations. Slopes are dominantly 1 to 3 percent but range to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches. Annual frost-free rainfall ranges from 25 to 30 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 230 to 245. The elevation ranges from 250 to 500 feet above sea level. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 72 to 82."

The soil is saturated in the layers below 2.5 to 3.5 feet deep and above the 2C horizon for more than 30 cumulative days during the winter and spring months in normal years."
