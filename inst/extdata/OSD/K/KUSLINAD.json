  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of fibrous moss over partially decomposed moss, twigs, and roots 8 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 4 to 35 inches below the mineral soil surface two months after the summer solstice.  Composite texture of the stratified particle size control section is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  There is less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section.  The organic mat is strongly acid or moderately acid and the mineral soil is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A or ACg horizon (when present) has moist value of 1 or 2; and moist chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Color stratification is common in this horizon due to variable organic matter content within the loess strata, however, organic matter content does not exceed 12 percent.\nThe Cg horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures are stratified and include very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, sand and loamy fine sand.  Redoximorphic features include redox concentrations with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist chroma of 4 through 6; redox depletions have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or 5GY; chroma of 0 through 2.  Coarse fragment content is less than 5 percent."

Copper River, Deborah, and Saulich soils have silty textures with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Kuslina soils have a thin loess mantle over alluvium. Mendeltna soils have more than 18 percent clay.  Tolsona soils are not stratified.  Umiat soils have weathered bedrock within the control section."

Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 21 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly or poorly drained. Runoff is slow. Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic mat, moderate in the mineral soil above the permafrost.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is destroyed by fire or clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level and subsequent lowering of the water table."
