The soils formed in mixed glacial outwash with a minor influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface. The soils are in a subhumid climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 35 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 degrees F; mean July temperature is 65 degrees F; and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."

Bonner, Kootenai, and Treble soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the control section. Bonner and Kootenai soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Treble soils are on mountains, foothills and escarpments. Rathdrum soils are ashy, have a udic soil moisture regime, and are in depressions on glacial outwash plains and terraces. Selle soils have base saturation less than 60 percent, have a udic soil moisture regime, and are on undulating or dune-like glaciolacustrine terraces. Stapaloop soils are coarse loamy, have E&Bt horizons and are on terraces and footslopes and toeslopes of foothills."

The Kaniksu and Kootenai soils were mapped within the same geographic area. Investigation is needed to confirm the base saturation and the Haplo vs. Dystroxerepts classification of the Kaniksu series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data available for Soil Survey Sample Numbers: S02ID-017-001 Bonner County, ID and S02WA-063-001 Spokane County, Washington.
