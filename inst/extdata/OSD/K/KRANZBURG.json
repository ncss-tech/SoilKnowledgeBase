    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to calcium carbonates typically is about 64 centimeters (25 inches), but ranges from 36 to 91 centimeters (14 to 36 inches). Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 18 to 41 centimeters (7 to 16 inches), and extends into the Bw horizon of some pedons. The depth to glacial till ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches). The glacial till contains more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser and 1 to 8 percent rock fragments. A stone line 3 to 8 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) in thickness is at the glacial till contact in most pedons. The particle size control section averages between 24 and 32 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1. It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon which is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. It has few to many accumulations of carbonate.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay loam or loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brandt, Great Bend, Kings Lake, Poinsett, and Putney series. The Brandt soils have a 2C horizon with more than 15 percent gravel. Great Bend soils are varved with thin layers of sand to clay at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness. Kings Lake and Poinsett soils have strata in the horizon above the glacial till. Strata ranges in texture from loam to silty clay loam and are 10 to 50 mm in thickness. Poinsett soils also have glacial till at a depth of greater than 102 centimeters (40 inches). Putney soils have gypsum and other salts within depths of 51 centimeters (20 inches)."

Slope gradients typically are less than 6 percent, but range from 0 to 9 percent. Kranzburg soils formed in 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of loess overlying glacial till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation from 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29 inches). Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation from 330 to 457 millimeters (13 to 18 inches); and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000. Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2130 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Badger soils have fine textured control sections and are in the deeper swales. The moderately well drained Brookings soils have mollic epipedons more than 41 centimeters (16 inches) and are on footslopes and in swales. The poorly drained Hidewood soils are in drainageways. McKranz soils have a calcic horizon within 41 centimeters (16 inches) of the surface and are along the edges of the deeper swales and drainageways.  The Vienna soils have glacial till between 25 and 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) and are on similar landscapes to the Kranzburg soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity, measured in cm per hour, is 1.52 to 5.10 (.6 to 2.0 inches) in the upper loess mantle and .51 to 1.52 (.2 to .6 inches) in the underlying glacial till.  Occasional saturation occurs as high as 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60) inches during the months April through June in years of above normal precipitation. In years with normal rainfall, saturation typically does not occur for periods of 1 month or more within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches)."
