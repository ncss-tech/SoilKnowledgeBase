  "OVERVIEW": "The Kolda series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks. Kolda soils are on lake plains, basin floors, and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
