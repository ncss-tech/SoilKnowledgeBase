    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,555 to 2,100 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Duffer soils are fine-silty and have carbonatic mineralogy, ochric epipedons, cambic horizons, and calcic horizons. Equis soils have carbonatic mineralogy and ochric epipedons. Sheffit soils have ochric epipedons and seasonal high water tables between 150 and 244 cm from the soil surface."
