  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sulfur content is more than 0.75 percent within depths of 20 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is more than three times the sulfur content for some portion.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline and the soil is calcareous.  It does not become extremely acid when dry.  Texture is sand or fine sand throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 6, chroma of 1 to 3.  Content of shell fragments ranges from about 5 to 15 percent.  Some pedons have organic horizons less than 8 inches thick above the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 2 to 8, chroma 1 to 3.  Content of shell fragments ranges from about 5 to 30 percent."

Dianola and Tatton soils have more than 10 percent silt and clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Hallandale soils are shallow to limestone. Plantation and Sanibel soils have histic epipedons.  Pompano soils are not subject to tidal flooding and have very low salinity."
