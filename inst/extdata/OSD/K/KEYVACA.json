Texture is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam; or their cobbly and very cobbly analogies with 30 to 50 percent gravel sized oolitic limestone fragments and 5 to 25 percent cobble sized fragments.  The soil has less than 45 percent silt.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe R horizon is soft to hard but rippable oolitic limestone."
