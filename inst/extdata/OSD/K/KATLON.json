  "OVERVIEW": "The Katlon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous materials and shale.  Katlon soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 25 to 45 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 32 inches.",
