  "OVERVIEW": "The Katlon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous materials and shale. These soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 25 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 710 to 810 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 to 4 degrees C.",
