  "OVERVIEW": "The Kearnsar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Kearnsar soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
