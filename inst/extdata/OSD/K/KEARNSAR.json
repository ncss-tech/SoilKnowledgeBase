Battle Creek soils are fine textured, free of carbonates to a depth of 12 inches or more, and are on about the same or slightly higher landscape positions.  Lando soils are fine-silty, have endosaturation at depths of 2 to 4 feet, and are on a lower landscape position.  Ricrest soils are fine-loamy, well drained, and are on higher lake terraces."
