  "OVERVIEW": "The Kreybill series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium from irrigation water over eolian deposits derived from mixed sedimentary materials.  Kreybill soils are on interfluves and plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
