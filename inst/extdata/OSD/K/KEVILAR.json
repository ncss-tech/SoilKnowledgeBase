  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy alluvium ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the underlying stratified loamy and sandy alluvium ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Redox accumulations and saturation occur within a depth of 72 inches.  Saturation does not occur within a depth of 40 inches for more than 1 month or more per year, in 6 or more out of 10 years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon, 5 to 8 inches thick with color and texture similar to the Ap.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in Ap horizons where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is stratified.  Individual strata are mostly sandy loam or loam with thin (<1\") strata of finer or coarser texture.  Sand content averages less than 70 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 4C horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is stratified.  Indiviual strata are mostly sand or loamy sand with thin strata of finer texture.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Backbone, Billett, Desker, Forkhorn, Kingsley, Oronoco, Pardeeville, Renwick(T), Rusktown, and Ulster series.   None of these soils except the moderately well drained phase of the Billett series and the Oronoco and Rusktown series have redox features or saturation in the series control section.  Billett soils average 70 to 90 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Oronoco soils have redox features but no saturation in the series control section and do not have sandy texture in the series control section.  Rusktown soils average 90 percent or more total sand in the lower part of the series control section."

Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle, rapid in the sandy middle part, and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying stratified alluvium.  Kevilar soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 3.5 to 6.0 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."

A few areas remain in woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and pine forest.  Northern pin oak, northern red oak, black oak, white oak and eastern white pine"
