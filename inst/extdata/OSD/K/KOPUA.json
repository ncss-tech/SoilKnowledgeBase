  "OVERVIEW": "The Kopua series consists of very shallow and shallow, moderately well drained soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. Slopes range from 3 to 10 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 3900 millimeters (157 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",

These soils are in constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level pahoehoe flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 3 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 3500 to 5100 millimeters (150 to 200 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 762 to 1016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 71 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
