  "OVERVIEW": "The Kancan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately\nslowly permeable soils that are formed in mixed alluvium.  They are on\ncoalesced fan terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 12 percent.  The average\nannual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual\ntemperature is about 46 degrees F.",
