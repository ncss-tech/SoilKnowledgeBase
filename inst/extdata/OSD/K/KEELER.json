  "OVERVIEW": "The Keeler series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, hills, and ridges.  They formed in material weathered from granitic or metamorphic bedrock with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slope ranges from 10 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",
