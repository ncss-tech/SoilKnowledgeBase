These soils formed in material weathered from granitic or metamorphic bedrock with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 1,600 to 5,050 feet (488 to 1540 meters).  The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, average annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 65 inches (660 to 1651 mm), and the average frost-free period is from 50 to 120 days."
