  "OVERVIEW": "The Katpa series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain sideslopes. These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone and loess. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Katpa soils have moderate permeability. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature isabout 37 degrees F.",
