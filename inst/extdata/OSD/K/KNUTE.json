  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon typically ranges from 14 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 16 to 30 inches. A thick solum phase is recognized where the depth to carbonates is 28 to 60 inches and the depth to the base of the argillic is more than 24 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 2 to 10 percent by volume of the profile.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 45 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days per year in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 2.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 10 to 20 percent, and the sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have an A horizon below the Ap horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically has redoximorphic features.  It is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  The argillic horizon is typically 6 to 16 inches thick, but in the thick solum phase it ranges from 16 to 28 inches thick.  The clay content of the argillic horizon averages between 18 and 28 percent with 45 to 65 percent sand.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline. The thick solum phase ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y , value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 and has redoximorphic features.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam. The non-carbonate clay content averages 10 to 18 percent with 45 to 65 percent sand.  Carbonate filaments and masses are common to many.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 and has redoximorphic features.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  The non-carbonate clay content averages 10 to 18 percent with 45 to 65 percent sand.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  There are few carbonate filaments and masses."

Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation ranges from 785 to 1600 feet."

The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Fram soils are on similar land forms but do not have an argillic B horizon.  The poorly drained Brandsvold and Hedman soils are in concave swales and drainways."
