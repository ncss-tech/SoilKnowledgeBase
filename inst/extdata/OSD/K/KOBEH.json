    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kobeh soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
