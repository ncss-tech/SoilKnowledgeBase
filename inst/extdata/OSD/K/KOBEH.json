  "OVERVIEW": "The Kobeh series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Kobeh soils are on inset fans, fan skirts and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
