(Bw horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 41 inches.  (2Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons)\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nThe CEC activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area soil survey.\nThe fine-loamy particle size classification is a tentative placement.  Further investigation of these landforms and sediments would be necessary to understand the relative percentages of silicate and carbonate clays for definitive placement.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
