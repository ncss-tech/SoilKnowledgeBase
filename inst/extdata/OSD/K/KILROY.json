  "OVERVIEW": "The Kilroy series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Kilroy soils are on fan remnants  and strath terraces  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Further investigation of these landforms and sediments would be necessary to understand the relative percentages of silicate and carbonate clays for definitive placement.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
