  "OVERVIEW": "The Kings Falls series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loamy till materials overlying limestone, dolomitic sandstone, or marble bedrock on till plains. Bedrock is at a depth of 25 to 50 cm. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the mineral soil. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 inches and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Stones, cobbles, channers, and gravel ranging from about 5 to 20 percent by volume commonly are on the surface and mixed throughout the pedon. Texture throughout the pedon includes sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or gravelly, channery, or cobbly analogs of these textures.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.\nSome pedons have a C horizon up to 5 inches thick with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4."
