Stones, cobbles, channers, and gravel ranging from about 5 to 20 percent by volume commonly are on the surface and mixed throughout the pedon. Texture throughout the pedon includes sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or gravelly, channery, or cobbly analogs of these textures.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.\nSome pedons have a C horizon up to 5 inches thick with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4."

Slope gradients typically are 2 to 12 percent, but range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 5 to 7 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1067 mm."

Grenville and Hogansburg soils are well drained and very deep to bedrock. Nehasne soils are well drained and moderately deep to bedrock."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 18 cm (Ap horizon);\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 36 cm (Bw horizons);\n3. Lithic contact of bedrock at 36 cm (R horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
