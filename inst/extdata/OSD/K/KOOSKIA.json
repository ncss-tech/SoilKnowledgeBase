  "OVERVIEW": "The Kooskia series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess over reworked loess and/or material from basalt. Kooskia soils are on  hills and drainageways on plateaus and on benches in canyons. Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is abut 48 degrees F.",
