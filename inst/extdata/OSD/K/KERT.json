  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizonand depth to the paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale range from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the silty mantle and depth to loamy residuum range from 12 to 30 inches.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent in the residuum.   Coarse fragments are mostly sandstone channers, but in many places, these soils occur near higher lying glacial soils and igneous pebbles are in the upper part of some pedons. Volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the silty mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 3 to 35 percent in the residuum.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the silty mantle, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the residuum. Redox concentrations are throughout the soil below the A horizon.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nKert soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, Kert soils can have E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon, has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The 2E part is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the channery analogs.\nThe 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 7; and chroma of 4 to 8.  It has texture like the 2E part described above.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue and value like the 2Bt part described above.  It has chroma of 2 to 8.  It has texture like the 2Bt part described above.   Thin subhorizons of coarser or finere texture are in some pedons.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon described above.  It is interbedded sandstone and shale."

Meadland, Milladore, Peshtigo, Point, Sprinkler, and Withee soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches.  Rietbrock soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Hiles soils do not have redox depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Merrillan soils have a spodic horizon, do not have a silty mantle, and are coarse-loamy."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  Kert soils formed in 12 to 30 inches of loess or silty alluvium and in loamy residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1400 feet."
