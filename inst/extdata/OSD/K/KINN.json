  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Other series in related families are the Algiers and Sligo soils. Algiers soils are shallower to aquic conditions and have redox depletions higher in the control section. Sligo soils do not have carbonates in the upper part of the control section and do not have a buried soil within the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kinn soils are on flood plains associated with the Wisconsinan or Illinoian till plain where the headwaters are in the Wisconsinan materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 46 to 91 cm (18 to 36 inches) of recent light colored, calcareous alluvium overlying a buried Mollisol. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 181 days. Elevation is 219 to 238 meters (720 to 780 feet) above mean sea level."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the recent alluvium and moderately slow in the buried soil. The soil is subject to occasional or frequent flooding."

These soils were initially placed in the fine-silty family textural class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).\nBuried soil: at 51 cm (top of the Ab1 horizon).\nAquic conditions: iron depletions or gleyed matrix below a depth of 96 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for RO-103, the typifying pedon, from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
