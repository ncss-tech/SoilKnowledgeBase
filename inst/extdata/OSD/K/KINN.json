  "OVERVIEW": "The Kinn series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 46 to 91 cm (18 to 36 inches) of recent light colored alluvium overlying a buried dark colored soil on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
