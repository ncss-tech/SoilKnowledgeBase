  "OVERVIEW": "The Kentland series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in eolian sandy sediments with a thin layer of organic material on lake plains.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy portion and moderate in the organic portion.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Redoximorphic depletions are masked by colors of stripped sand grains in the 3C horizons that have chromas more than 2.\nThe upper part of the series control section (A) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, or has neutral hue and value of 2.  Organic matter content is 8 to 16 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral depending on liming history.\nThe second part of the series control section (2Oa) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is dominantly sapric material, but contains 20 to 30 percent marl, mostly as pieces.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section (C) has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
