  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the organic material and free carbonates, and thickness of the overlying sandy sediments are 10 to 18 inches.  Redoximorphic depletions are masked by colors of stripped sand grains in the 3C horizons that have chromas more than 2.\nThe upper part of the series control section (A) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, or has neutral hue and value of 2.  Organic matter content is 8 to 16 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral depending on liming history.\nThe second part of the series control section (2Oa) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is dominantly sapric material, but contains 20 to 30 percent marl, mostly as pieces.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section (C) has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

They formed in eolian sandy sediments with a thin layer of organic material.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 39 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 52 degrees F."
