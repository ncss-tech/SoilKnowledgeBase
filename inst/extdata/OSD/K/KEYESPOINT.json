  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 38 inches. Depth to a loamy textured layer is 24 to 40 inches. Cracks 1 to 2 cm wide develop to a depth of 50 cm or more in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately acid.\nThe Bg horizon commonly has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 with few to many mottles in shades of brown, red, or gray. Some pedons have a chroma of 3 above a depth of 20 inches. Texture is silty clay or clay. A few pedons have thin subhorizons of silty clay loam. Structure is moderate or weak subangular blocky or angular blocky. Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3 with few to many mottles in shades of brown and gray. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Some pedons have a 3C horizon with colors like those in the 2C horizon except mottles range from none to common. Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand. Reaction of the 2C and 3C horizons is moderately alkaline to moderately acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Tunica series. Series in closely related families are Alligator, Bowdre, Commerce, Earle, Leeper, Oleno, Openlake, Newellton, and Sharkey. Tunica soils have chroma of less than 2 or have chroma 2 with value of 6 in the upper part of the B horizon. Alligator, Leeper, Openlake,\nand Sharkey soils have a very fine or fine-textured particle-size control section. Bowdre and Newellton soils are clayey in the upper 12 to 20 inches over loamy layers, and in addition, Bowdre soils have a mollic epipedon. Earle and Oleno soils are in an acid family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Keyespoint soils are on broad level to undulating braided flood plains of the lower Mississippi River. The slope range is commonly 0 to 2 percent, but ranges to 5 percent. They Keyespoint soils formed in recent clayey alluvium in the upper part and loamy alluvium in the lower part. The mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 51 inches near the type location."

This soil is most often flooded during the winter and spring except where protected by levees. Duration of flooding is from a few days to one month. The water table is within 1.0 to 2.0 feet of the surface during the winter and early spring."
