  "STATES": "KY,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Keyespoint series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium over loamy alluvium. These soils are on broad, level to undulating, braided flood plains of the lower Mississippi River. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 2 percent but range to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 51 inches.",

Cracks 1 to 2 cm wide develop to a depth of 50 cm or more in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately acid.\nThe Bg horizon commonly has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 with few to many mottles in shades of brown, red, or gray. Some pedons have a chroma of 3 above a depth of 20 inches. Texture is silty clay or clay. A few pedons have thin subhorizons of silty clay loam. Structure is moderate or weak subangular blocky or angular blocky. Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3 with few to many mottles in shades of brown and gray. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Some pedons have a 3C horizon with colors like those in the 2C horizon except mottles range from none to common. Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand. Reaction of the 2C and 3C horizons is moderately alkaline to moderately acid."

Tunica soils have chroma of less than 2 or have chroma 2 with value of 6 in the upper part of the B horizon. Alligator, Leeper, Openlake,\nand Sharkey soils have a very fine or fine-textured particle-size control section. Bowdre and Newellton soils are clayey in the upper 12 to 20 inches over loamy layers, and in addition, Bowdre soils have a mollic epipedon. Earle and Oleno soils are in an acid family."

CE activity class of superactive added in 2002.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon--7 to 30 inches (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons)\nDiscontinuity and contrasting textural change at a depth of 30 inches.\nLaboratory data: Particle size, pH, CEC, and extractable cations were determined for 3 pedons by the University of Tennessee."
