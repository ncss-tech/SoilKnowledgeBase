The soils formed in residuum from basic igneous rocks probably with some additions of volcanic ash and/or ejecta.  Annual rainfall is from 60 to 70 inches with nearly daily afternoon cloud cover.  Average January temperature is about 53 degrees F.; and average July temperature is about 65 degrees F.   Mean annual temperature is about 6O degrees F."
