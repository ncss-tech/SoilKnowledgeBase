  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F.  Depth to highly fractured bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more.  Rock fragments of gravel and cobble size range from 15 to 50 percent in the A horizons and from 35 to 70 percent in the B horizons, increasing with depth.  The thickness of the umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  Chroma of less than 3.5 moist extends to a depth of at least 10 inches.  It is moderately to very strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 in the upper part and 4 to 6 in the lower part moist, and 4 to 6 dry. It is dominantly clay loam but ranges to loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  Its structure ranges from weak to moderate, fine or very fine subangular blocky.  It is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klickitat soils are on dissected slopes in mountainous topography at elevations of 500 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in stony colluvium of moderately fine or medium texture.  Coarse fragments are scattered throughout the colluvium and these are dominantly basalt, but other kinds of rock are included such as gabbro and granite diorite.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F, mean January temperature is about 37 degrees F, and mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 200 days."

Kichis soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock. Marty soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the solum."
