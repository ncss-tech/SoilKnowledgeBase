  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 45 inches. The particle-size control section averages between 6 and 15 percent clay and from 65 to 85 percent fine sand or coarser. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 5 to 25 percent in the substratum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum and  from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum.  Some pedons are calcareous below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is sandy loam in the upper part and loamy sand in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chrom of 3 do not occur together. Texture is sand or loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs."

Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 36 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to about 51 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boyer, Coloma, Mecan, Oshtemo, Richford, and Wyocena soils.  Boyer and Oshtemo soils are on less sloping landscapes and formed in glacial outwash.  Coloma soils have lamellae, but they do not constitute an argillic horizon.  Mecan and Wyocena soils occupy similar landscape positions, but they have finer textured argillic horizons.  Richford soils are on similar slopes, but formed in outwash."

The present vegetation is mixed hardwoods with scrub oak predominating. Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland. Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 16 inches (Ap, E, BE);argillic horizon - 16 to 36 inches (Bt1, Bt2).\n11/2006  The concept of this series is believed to be a sandy Alfisol developed in sandy till with a thin sandy loam layer (5 to 9 inches) in the upper part of the argillic horizon. However, about 4800 acres were correlated as a Taxadjunct in Waupaca Co. because they do not have the sandy loam layer in the argillic. There are many questions that need field checking. 1) Is the sandy loam layer always present in Portage Co. where the type location occurs? 2) If not, does the loamy sand Bt have the 3 percent clay increase necessary for an argillic? 3) How deep is soil development? The RIC says some pedons are calcareous below 40 inches. Are these soils formed in calcareous till? If so, perhaps sola are deeper than described and extend to carbonates.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
