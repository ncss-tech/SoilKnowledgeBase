Elevations are 3,300 to 4,200 feet.   The climate is semiarid with hot summers and cool moist winters, with occasional summer convectional rain storms.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is about 190 to 240 days."
