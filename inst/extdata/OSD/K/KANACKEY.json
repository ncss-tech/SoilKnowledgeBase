  "OVERVIEW": "The Kanackey series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from quartzite, schist and minor amounts of tuff.  The Kanackey soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
