  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The B horizon is very strongly or strongly acid, and the C horizon ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid. Content of rock fragments, commonly slate channers or quartz gravel, ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A and Bt horizons, and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon. Content of feldspar crystals in the lower part of the subsoil ranges from 0 to about 6 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 2 to 4. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8, commonly with mottles of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, commonly with mottles of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8. It is silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  Iron depletions of chroma 1 or 2 are within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon of all pedons.\nThe BCt horizon commonly is mottled in hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon commonly is mottled in hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have as much as 90 percent highly weathered soft slate or fine grained schist."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Docena and Secrest series are the only other known series in this family. Alamance, Callison, Cid, Lignum, Mandale (T), and Pageland series are similar soils in related families. Docena soils formed in alluvial, colluvial, and shaly residual sediments on low areas of the Appalachian Plateau and have a depth to bedrock of more than 60 inches. Secrest soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.  Alamance soils are well drained.  Callison soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches and a depth to hard bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.  Cid, Lignum, and Mandale (T) soils have a clayey particle-size control section. Pageland soils have a Cr horizon at 20 to 40 inches and are Alfisols."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kirksey soils occur on saddles and lower slopes in uplands in the Piedmont. The soils formed in materials weathered from Carolina slate or other fine-grained rock. Slopes commonly are 2 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F., the mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 60 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 190 to 230 days."

Badin, Georgeville, Gundy, Herndon, Nanford, and Tarrus soils are well drained and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Goldston and Misenheimer soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have a depth to soft bedrock of less than 20 inches.  Montonia soils are well drained, fine-loamy, and have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches and a depth to hard bedrock of 40 to 60 inches."
