  "OVERVIEW": "The Konawa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age  They are on treads and risers of low stream terraces in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
