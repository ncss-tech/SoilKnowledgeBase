  "REVDATE": "04/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kalsted series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium, colluvium or eolian material.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, stream terraces, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
