Texture is flaggy or very flaggy phases of silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  Coarse flat fragments of limestone or dolomite range from 35 to 70 percent by volume.  Flat fragments less than 76 mm in diameter make up 5 to 10 percent by volume and flat fragments more than 76 mm in diameter make up 30 to 60 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The R layer is hard tilted limestone.  It is tilted 20 to 85 degrees from horizontal."

Brewster, Eckert, Lampshire, and Palopinto soils are dry for longer periods during the year.  Rayford soils have a smooth boundary over hard conglomerate.   Timhill soils are more acid in reaction and are underlain with hard rhyolite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kiti soils are on very gently sloping to steep convex ridges and side slopes of the Arbuckle Mountains, the Wichita Mountains, and the Ouachita Mountains. Slopes are 1 to 45 percent.  They formed in material weathered from tilted limestone of Ordovician and Pre-cambrian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 38 to 64. Frost free days 200 to 220.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1500 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rayford, Scullin, Somervill, Timhill, and Woodford series.  Rayford and Woodford soils occur lower on the landscape.  In addition, Rayford soils usually occur on the north side of the mountains and Woodford soils usually occur on the south side of the mountains. Somervell soils are greater than 20 inches to hard limestone bedrock. Timhill soils occur on higher areas of the landscape and have native vegetation of oak trees with an understory of mid and tall grasses.  Scullin soils occur on smooth convex uplands lower on the landscape and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  In addition, Scullin soils have a solum more than 20 inches thick and have argillic horizons."
