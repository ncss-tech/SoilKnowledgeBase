  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Kiti series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from tilted limestone of Ordovician and Pre-cambrian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to steep convex ridges and side slopes of the Arbuckle Mountains (MLRA 85B), the Wichita Mountains (MLRA 82B) and the Ouachita Mountains (MLRA 119).  Slopes are 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 inches.  Mean air annual temperature is 63 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to hard limestone bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is flaggy or very flaggy phases of silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  Coarse flat fragments of limestone or dolomite range from 35 to 70 percent by volume.  Flat fragments less than 76 mm in diameter make up 5 to 10 percent by volume and flat fragments more than 76 mm in diameter make up 30 to 60 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The R layer is hard tilted limestone.  It is tilted 20 to 85 degrees from horizontal."

Brewster, Eckert, Lampshire, and Palopinto soils are dry for longer periods during the year.  Rayford soils have a smooth boundary over hard conglomerate.   Timhill soils are more acid in reaction and are underlain with hard rhyolite."

In addition, Rayford soils usually occur on the north side of the mountains and Woodford soils usually occur on the south side of the mountains. Somervell soils are greater than 20 inches to hard limestone bedrock. Timhill soils occur on higher areas of the landscape and have native vegetation of oak trees with an understory of mid and tall grasses.  Scullin soils occur on smooth convex uplands lower on the landscape and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  In addition, Scullin soils have a solum more than 20 inches thick and have argillic horizons."
