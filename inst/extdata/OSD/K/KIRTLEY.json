  "OVERVIEW": "The Kirtley series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to soft bedrock. They formed in slope alluvium over calcareous residuum weathered from redbed shales and sandstone. Kirtley soils are on bedrock controlled hills, ridges, cuestas and low hills in strike valleys. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
