  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches but is dominantly greater than 72 inches.  Rock fragments, dominantly chert but with some sandstone and shale, range from less than 5 to 50 percent by volume in individual horizons of the solum and C horizon.  The soil ranges from neutral to very strongly acid in the upper part of the solum is strongly and or very strongly acid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Fine-earth texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 in the upper part. The lower part has same colors but the hue includes 5YR.  Prism faces in the middle and lower parts of the B horizon have iron depletions that are commonly gray, grayish brown or light brownish gray.  Few to many iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are at depths of 18 to 35 inches.  Some pedons have individual B horizons with matrix color of 2 chroma or less, but these horizons are deeper than 18 inches.  Fine-earth texture of the B horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.  Structure is commonly weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky or angular blocky in the upper part.  The middle and lower parts of the B horizon also often have  medium to very coarse prismatic and medium and coarse platy structure.\nThe C horizon is similar to the B horizon in color and texture."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Fawcett soil were formerly in the same family, but have been made inactive.\nCavode, Cruze, Flatwoods, Grassland (T), Halifax (T), Lackstown (T) and Latham soils are in similar families, but have mixed mineralogy. Cavode soils formed in residuum from gray and yellow acid shale and siltstone and have redox features within 18 inches of the surface. Cruze, Flatwoods and Latham soils formed in residuum or colluvium dominated by shale and siltstone. Flatwoods and Latham soils are moderately deep to shale or siltstone bedrock. Grassland and Halifax soils formed in residuum from igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks and have rock fragments that are dominantly these types. Lackstown soils formed from residuum from Triassic age sandstone, mudstone, siltstone and shale and have rock fragments that are dominantly these types."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kreamer soils are on nearly level to gently sloping concave hillsides with slope gradients up to 15 percent.  The soils developed in fine and moderately fine textured colluvium or glacial drift derived from limestone and cherty limestone.  The climate is humid temperate.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 48 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 150 to 210 days."

Elliber, Mertz and Morrison soils have less than 35 percent clay and do not have redoximorphic features within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon.  Evendale soils have redoximorphic features throughout the upper portion of the argillic horizon.  Hagerstown soils do not have redoximorphic features within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon. Additionally, Evendale, Hagerstown and Morrison soils have a higher base saturation in the lower part of the subsoil or substratum."

Redoximorphic feature terminology and competing series were also updated at this time.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 60 inches (BA, Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).\nc. Aquic subgroup criteria - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and redox concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data are available for three pedons; two in Perry County, Pennsylvania - S70PA50-13 and S70PA50-15; and one in Snyder County, Pennsylvania - S69PA55-06.\nMLRA: 147\nRevised: 1/87-DGG,IWR,ADK; 2/2002-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
