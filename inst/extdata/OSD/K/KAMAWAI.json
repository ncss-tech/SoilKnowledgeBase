  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kamawai soils are on north and northwest slopes on the undissected upland of Hualalai Volcano at elevations from 1067 to 1829 meters (3500 to 6000 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to very steep `a`a lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 762 to 1016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from January through July.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1524 millimeters (50 to 60 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
