  "OVERVIEW": "The Kaiar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sands and slope alluvium from calcareous sandstone and limestone.  Kaiar soils are on structural benches and mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
