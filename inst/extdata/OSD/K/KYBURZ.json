  "OVERVIEW": "The Kyburz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basic volcanic rock. Kyburz soils occur on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees.",

The soil between depths of about 10 to 20 inches is usually dry all of the time from July 15 until November 1 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. Mean annual soil temperature is about 43 degrees to 47 degrees. Rock fragments make up 5 to 35 percent of the profile. Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout the argillic.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2; 5YR 4/3, 4/4 and 5/3. Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 with moist chromas of 3 or less above 7 inches. It is sandy loam or loam. It is slightly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/4 and 5/4, and has moist color of 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4. It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and averages less than 35 percent clay. It is slightly to very strongly acid."
