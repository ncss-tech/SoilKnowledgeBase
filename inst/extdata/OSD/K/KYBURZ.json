  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The soil between depths of about 10 to 20 inches is usually dry all of the time from July 15 until November 1 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. Mean annual soil temperature is about 43 degrees to 47 degrees. Rock fragments make up 5 to 35 percent of the profile. Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout the argillic.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2; 5YR 4/3, 4/4 and 5/3. Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 with moist chromas of 3 or less above 7 inches. It is sandy loam or loam. It is slightly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/4 and 5/4, and has moist color of 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4. It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and averages less than 35 percent clay. It is slightly to very strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. These soils formed in residuum from basic volcanic flows, breccias and agglomerates. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees to 47 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F. and mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 30 days."
