  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to seasonal high water table ranges from O to 6 inches. The histic epipedon is 6 to 16 inches thick. The soils have chroma of less than 1 if not mottled or if mottled chroma is 2 or less within 12 inches below the histic epipedon. Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth or remains above .35 percent within 50 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 40 to 60 percent between 10 and 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. at 20 inches. The histic epipedon has value of 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less. The soils are moderately to strongly alkaline and moderately or strongly saline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist and chroma of 1 or 2. It has few to common faint to distinct, yellowish brown to brown mottles. The control section averages silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay, and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Darker colored buried horizons high in organic matter content range from few to common and are 1/4 to 9 inches thick."
