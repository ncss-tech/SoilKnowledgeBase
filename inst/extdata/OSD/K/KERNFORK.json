The 10 to 40 inch (25 to 102 cm.) control section is stratified and averages less than 18 percent clay by weight and has more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  EC is 8 or less Ds/m.  SAR is 30 or less.  Organic matter is 1 to 5 percent in the upper 27 inches (69 cm.). Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth below 27 inches (69 cm.).\nRedoximorphic depletions and accumulations are present within a depth of 30 inches (76 cm.). Redoximorphic depletions and accumulations occur within the mollic epipedon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is stratified sandy loam to silt loam.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2 or 4/3.

The soils formed in alluvium dominantly derived from granitic rock sources.  The climate is dry subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 57 to 64 degrees F. (14 to 18 degrees C.).  The frost-free season is 180 to 220 days."

The water table is at depths of 12 to 36 inches (30 to 92 cm.)  in the frequently flooded phase and 36 to 60 inches (92 to 153 cm.) in the occasionally flooded phase. Some part of the soil profile is always saturated at some time during most years.  The soil lacks saturation between depths of 40 and 50 centimeters in normal years.  Some areas have a seasonal water table at a depth of 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51 cm.) due to flood irrigation from canals."
