  "OVERVIEW": "The Kernfork series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium dominantly from granitic rock sources.  Kernfork soils are on floodplains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (230 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. (16 degrees C).",
