These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days in summer and autumn. The particle-size control section is 6 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments. Depth to calcareous lake sediments lithologic discontinuity, ranges from 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist. It is sandy loam to silty clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Arrastre and Bestrom soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Barron soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F. and are moderately acid in the B horizon. Cassolary soils are slightly acid or moderately acid in the solum. Clayton soils have a banded B horizon and lack carbonates in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Frailey, Hudnut, and Koseth soils are l5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Green Bluff soils lack carbonates and a lithologic discontinuity in the particle-size control section. Quiden soils are dry for 90 to l05 days and have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR. Scala soils have a sola more than 40 inches thick and are not calcareous in any part of the particle-size control section. Stoner soils are dry for more than 90 days and are l5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Tallowbax soils are 20 to 40- inches deep to a paralithic contact."
