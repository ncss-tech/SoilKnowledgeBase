    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Katelana soils are on lake plains, lagoons, alluvial flats and lower fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone over calcareous lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,560 to 2,050 meters.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with warm, dry summers and cold, winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
