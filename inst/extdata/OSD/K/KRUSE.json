These soils formed in residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, or mica schist with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash at elevations of 1,600 to 4,700 feet (488 to 1433 meters). The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 43 inches (635 to 1092 mm). The average frost-free period is from 80 to 130 days."

Melder soils are on south-facing mountain footslopes, are loamy-skeletal, and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Vassar soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and have volcanic ash surface horizons."
