  "OVERVIEW": "The Kruse series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, canyon sides, ridges and hills. They formed in residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, and mica schist with a mantle of mixed ash and loess. Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Slope ranges from 0 to 75 percent. The average annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 30 inches.",
