Royst soils when originally described did not describe the R, the description stopped with the Cr contact. The Snell and Royst series were separated on lithic vs. paralithic contact. When the Royst Series was revised and the R contact described these two series became similar. As mapped the Snell series is mapped in MLRA 9 and 43 and Royst in MLRA 10, 21 and 43. The areas mapped as Royst in MLRA 43 should be re-correlated to the Snell series. MLRA 9 is a grass dominated range area with late spring precipitation. MLRA 10 and 21 is a grass-shrub dominated range area which lacks the spring precipitation. In addition, the Royst series in MLRA 21 has been sampled, has Vitrandic properties, and no longer competes with the Snell series.\n01/2017 This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting; no major technical changes were made.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
