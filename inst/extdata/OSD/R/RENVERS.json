The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F. The particle-size control section contains 8 to 18 percent clay, 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Rock fragments range from 30 to 45 percent stones and channers, and 0 to 20 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe AC or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Elevation is 6000 to 7800 feet.  Precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, with about half falling as snow and rain in April, May, and early June. The frost-free season is 85 to 100 days depending on aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
