  "OVERVIEW": "The Runningsprings series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granitoid sources. The Runningsprings soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 9 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",
