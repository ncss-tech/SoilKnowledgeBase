The soil formed in clayey residuum of weathered calcareous shales.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 910 to 1140 millimeters (36 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 16 degrees C (57 to 60 degrees F).  Elevation is 244 to 345 meters (800 to 1130 feet) above mean sea level.
