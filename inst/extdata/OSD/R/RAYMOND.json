  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Raymond series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from siltstone or sandstone. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 35 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.",
