  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redcanyon soils are on sideslopes of hills and mountains and are associated with rock outcrop. They formed in colluvium over basalt and tuff. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,280 to 1,465 meters. The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."
