  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ruclick soils are on summits, dipslopes, and sideslopes of foothills and tablelands at elevations of 4,000 to 6,500 feet in Idaho, and as low as 1,200 feet in Oregon.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium,and residuum from basalt, welded tuff and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 14 inches and as low as 9 inches in Oregon.   The average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 80 to 160 days."

Weash soils are shallow to welded ash and lack argillic horizons.  Oshone soils are not skeletal and are moderately deep to a duripan.  Oshone and Weash soils occur on terraces."
