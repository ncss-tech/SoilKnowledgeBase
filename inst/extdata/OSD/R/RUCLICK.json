  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruclick series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium mainly from basalt.  They are on foothills and tablelands.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium,and residuum from basalt, welded tuff and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 14 inches and as low as 9 inches in Oregon.   The average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 80 to 160 days."
