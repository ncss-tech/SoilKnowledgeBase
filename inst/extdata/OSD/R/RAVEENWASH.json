  "BYREV": "WMT",
  "REVDATE": "08/2000",
  "STATES": "IL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Raveenwash series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in calcareous, stratified loamy alluvium on flood plains.  These soils have moderately rapid and rapid permeability.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degress F., and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.",

The depth to free calcium carbonate is less than 10 inches and is commonly at the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is commonly silt loam.  It contains less than 10 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 through 7 and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is stratified silt loam, loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, and sand.  Sand content ranges from 10 to 95 percent, and clay content ranges 1 to 27 percent.  It contains less than 10 percent gravel."

The Jules soils are moderately well drained and well drained coarse-silty.  Slacwater soils are poorly drained and fine-silty.  Landes soils are moderately well and  well drained and have deeper solums and depths to calcium carbonates and have a mollic epipedon."
