The depth to free calcium carbonate is less than 10 inches and is commonly at the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is commonly silt loam.  It contains less than 10 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 through 7 and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is stratified silt loam, loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, and sand.  Sand content ranges from 10 to 95 percent, and clay content ranges 1 to 27 percent.  It contains less than 10 percent gravel."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

The Jules soils are moderately well drained and well drained coarse-silty.  Slacwater soils are poorly drained and fine-silty.  Landes soils are moderately well and  well drained and have deeper solums and depths to calcium carbonates and have a mollic epipedon."

Jules soils are moderately well drained and well drained are coarse-silty.  Lena soils are organic and are in depressions and toeslope seepy areas.  Slacwater soils are fine-silty and are on more frequently flooded areas closer to the river."
