Aco soils are in the Colorado Desert portion of southeast California (MLRA 31) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry April through November. Coolidge and Laveen soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Also, Laveen soils are medium textured. Garywash soils are in the Colorado Desert portion of southeast California (MLRA 31) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry April through November and have secondary accumulations of silica and gypsum in the control section. Toltec soils have a calcic horizon that consists of a disintegrated hardpan."

Elevations range from 400 to 2200 feet.  Rillito soils are in a hot, arid and continental climate.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 67 to 75 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  Precipitation falls as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."
