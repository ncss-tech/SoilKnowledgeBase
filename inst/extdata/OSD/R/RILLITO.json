  "OVERVIEW": "The Rillito series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Rillito soils are on fan terraces or stream terraces.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 5 percent, but range to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.",

Coolidge and Laveen soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Also, Laveen soils are medium textured. Garywash soils are in the Colorado Desert portion of southeast California (MLRA 31) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry April through November and have secondary accumulations of silica and gypsum in the control section. Toltec soils have a calcic horizon that consists of a disintegrated hardpan."
