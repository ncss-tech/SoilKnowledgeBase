  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates range from 30 to 60 inches.  The upper mantle is 20 to less than 40 inches thick.  Rock fragments, by volume, range from 0 to 10 percent gravel in the upper part and 2 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the underlying till. A gravelly lag line up to 5 inches thick may occur at the contact of the upper mantle and the till.  Rock fragments range to 35 percent, by volume, in this horizon.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages less than 18 percent clay, but some subhorizons have up to 27 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  When mixed to 7 inches the value is 6 or greater.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy coarse sand.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Thin lamellae may occur in this horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or coarse sandy loam.   The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon similar to the Bt but includes textures of clay loam and sandy clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, sand or coarse sand.   The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bk horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  Carbonate threads or masses are common to many.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a thin 2BC horizon with loamy or silty textures.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5R, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The moist bulk density is 1.4 to 1.6 g/cc."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bushville, Eckvoll, and Huntersville soils.  Bushville and Huntersville soils have a densic contact in the lower third of the series control section.  Eckvoll soils have an epipedon that, when mixed to 7 inches, has a dry value of 5 or less and do not have soil saturation in the upper third of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ricelake soils are on plane or slightly concave surfaces on moraines, lake washed till plains and glacial beach ridges.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in a sandy glacial outwash or eolian mantle and underlying calcareous, loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free days range from 88 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1,500 feet."
