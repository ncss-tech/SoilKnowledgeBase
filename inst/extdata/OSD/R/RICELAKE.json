  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ricelake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a sandy glacial outwash or eolian mantle and underlying calcareous, loamy till.  These soils are on moraines, lake washed till plains and glacial beach ridges.  They have rapid permeability in the upper mantle and moderate to moderately slow permeability in the underlying till.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches at the type location.",

Rock fragments, by volume, range from 0 to 10 percent gravel in the upper part and 2 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the underlying till. A gravelly lag line up to 5 inches thick may occur at the contact of the upper mantle and the till.  Rock fragments range to 35 percent, by volume, in this horizon.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages less than 18 percent clay, but some subhorizons have up to 27 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  When mixed to 7 inches the value is 6 or greater.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy coarse sand.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Thin lamellae may occur in this horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or coarse sandy loam.   The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon similar to the Bt but includes textures of clay loam and sandy clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, sand or coarse sand.   The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bk horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  Carbonate threads or masses are common to many.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a thin 2BC horizon with loamy or silty textures.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5R, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The moist bulk density is 1.4 to 1.6 g/cc."
