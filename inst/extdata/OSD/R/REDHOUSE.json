  "OVERVIEW": "The Redhouse series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Redhouse soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces, and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
