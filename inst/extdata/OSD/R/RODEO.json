Difference between mean winter and mean summer temperature is 5 degrees to 8 degrees F. The soil moisture control section is usually moist in all parts for 45 consecutive days. The particle-size control section commonly becomes more acid as depth increases.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2. This horizon has moderate or strong subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe A2 horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, with common 10YR 5/6, 6/6 or 6/8 mottles, and 10YR 5/3, 5/8, 6/3 or 6/8 mottles moist.
