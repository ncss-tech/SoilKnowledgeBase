  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact composed of shale or interbedded shale and sandstone ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Vertical cracks extend from the surface and range from 1 to 5 centimeters wide at a depth of 50 centimeters. The cracks usually close in January or February for less than 60 consecutive days and remain open the rest of the year. Few to many intersecting slickensides oclcur in some horizon below a depth of 10 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/3 5/3, 5/2; or 2.5Y 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/2; or 2.5Y 4/4. In some pedons the surface horizon has value of 3 moist, but it is less than 2 inches thick. The A horizon has strong fine or medium granular, strong coarse or very coarse prismatic, or moderate or strong medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/3, 5/2; or 2.5Y 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3; or 2.5Y 4/4. Mottles are few to many, fine or medium distinct or prominent and have moist color of 7.5YR 5/6, 6/8; or 10YR 5/8. The mottles are considered to be relict mottles. This horizon is clay or clay loam and averages 35 to 60 percent clay. Rock fragments, ranging in size from 2 mm to 3 inches, are 0 to 5 percent.  This horizon has strong coarse or very coarse prismatic or strong coarse subangular blocky structure. It is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent. Lime is disseminated and in seams or soft masses. Electrical conductivity of this horizon ranges from 4 to 8 mmhos."

Armijo and Dalby soils are intermittently moist in the moisture control section during the period of June through September. Also, the Dalby soils have hue redder than 10YR. Montoya soils have moist color value of less than 4 in the surface horizon, or in more than the upper 12 inches have moist color value of less than 4. In addition, Armijo and Montoya series lack any paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches."
