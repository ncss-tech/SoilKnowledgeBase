  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nMean annual soil temperature - 47 to 53 degrees F.\nThe soils have characteristics associated with wetness in the A horizon or in the upper part of the Bkg horizons. Depth to water table is 0 to 36 inches. The zone of carbonate enrichment begins in the lower part of the A horizon and extends into the Bkg horizons. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 80 percent. The soil is slightly to strongly salt affected. Soils having a peaty layer 1 to 5 inches thick on the surface are within the range of the series.\nThe Ap and ABk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5 dry and 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less. Texture of the A horizon is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam. The Ap horizon commonly has about 6 to 10 percent organic matter, and it ranges from 3 to 20 percent.\nThe Bkg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral gray, value is 5 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist; and chroma is 1 or less, where the soil is mottled it has chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the 10 to 40 inch control section is loam or silt loam. Carbonate nodules and discontinuous cementation by carbonates are within the range of the series.\nTexture of the Cg horizon is fine sandy loam to clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roshe Springs soils are on low lake terraces and flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived dominantly from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and gneiss.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,100 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 175 days."
