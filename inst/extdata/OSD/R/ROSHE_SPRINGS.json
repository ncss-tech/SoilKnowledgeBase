  "OVERVIEW": "The Roshe Springs series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and gneiss.  Roshe Springs soils are on low lake terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nMean annual soil temperature - 47 to 53 degrees F.\nThe soils have characteristics associated with wetness in the A horizon or in the upper part of the Bkg horizons. Depth to water table is 0 to 36 inches. The zone of carbonate enrichment begins in the lower part of the A horizon and extends into the Bkg horizons. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 80 percent. The soil is slightly to strongly salt affected. Soils having a peaty layer 1 to 5 inches thick on the surface are within the range of the series.\nThe Ap and ABk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5 dry and 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less. Texture of the A horizon is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam. The Ap horizon commonly has about 6 to 10 percent organic matter, and it ranges from 3 to 20 percent.\nThe Bkg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral gray, value is 5 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist; and chroma is 1 or less, where the soil is mottled it has chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the 10 to 40 inch control section is loam or silt loam. Carbonate nodules and discontinuous cementation by carbonates are within the range of the series.\nTexture of the Cg horizon is fine sandy loam to clay."
