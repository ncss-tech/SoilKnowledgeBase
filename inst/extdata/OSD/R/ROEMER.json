  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  Thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  Iron concentration range from few to common, fine to medium, in shades of yellow or brown.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron concentrations range from few to many, fine to coarse, in shades of brown, red, and yellow.  Texture of the upper 20 inches is fine sandy loam, but some part of some pedons ranges to sandy clay loam.  Average clay content of the particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has the same color range as the Bt horizon.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam."

Boca and Felda soils are saturated and moist for longer periods of time.  In addition, Boca soils are 20 to 40 inches thick over limestone.  Felda soils have neutral to slightly alkaline reaction in the Bt horizons.  Pinellas soils have calcareous B horizons."

Dianola soils are sandy throughout and Rahal soils have a clayey particle-size control section.  Portalto soils are mapped in a complex with Roemer soils, are slightly higher in the landscape and have a grossarenic surface layer."

Water is ponded on the surface for a few days after heavy rains and a water table is perched above the Bt horizon for a few days to one month.  The soil is saturated during the cool season in most years."
