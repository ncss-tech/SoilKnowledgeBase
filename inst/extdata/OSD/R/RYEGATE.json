  "OVERVIEW": "The Ryegate series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in coarse eolian sediments and residuum derived dominantly from hard sandstone.  Ryegate soils are on plains, hills, ridges, and fans.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",

(Bt and BCt horizons)\nCalcic horizon: the zone from 32 to 38 inches (2Bk horizon)\nLithic contact: sandstone at 36 inches.\nOther features: Aridic ustic moisture regime.\nRemarks: The Ryegate series was first proposed in Yellowstone County, Montana, but was transferred to Las Animas County, Colorado due to a change in temperature regimes in Montana from mesic to frigid.  The series is named after a town close by the original type location.  Last updated by the state 12/89.\nModified by Lee Neve in January 2002 changing taxonomy from Aridic to Calcidic, in addition to basic reformatting to create a semitab format.\nTaxonomic Version: Second Edition, 1999."
