(Bt and BCt horizons)\nCalcic horizon: the zone from 32 to 38 inches (2Bk horizon)\nLithic contact: sandstone at 36 inches.\nOther features: Aridic ustic moisture regime.\nRemarks: The Ryegate series was first proposed in Yellowstone County, Montana, but was transferred to Las Animas County, Colorado due to a change in temperature regimes in Montana from mesic to frigid.  The series is named after a town close by the original type location.  Last updated by the state 12/89.\nModified by Lee Neve in January 2002 changing taxonomy from Aridic to Calcidic, in addition to basic reformatting to create a semitab format.\nTaxonomic Version: Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
