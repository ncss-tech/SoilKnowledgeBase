  "OVERVIEW": "The Round Lake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 40 to 60 inches of loamy and sandy outwash sediments over loamy glacial till or lacustrine silty sediments. They are on moraines, till plains or kames. Slope ranges from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches. A clay increase is mostly typical in the Bw horizons; however, the B/A ratio is less than 1.2.The content of gravel, by volume, ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper loamy mantle, 10 to 35 percent in the sandy sediment, 0 to 5 percent in the underlying lacustrine sediments and 2 to 8 percent in the underlying till. Some pedons have thin subhorizons with more than 35 percent gravel. Cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent and stones range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam. It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam averaging less than 18 percent clay. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, sand or their gravelly analogs. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand, or loamy sand or their gravelly analogs. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate coats are common on the bottom side of sand grains and pebbles.\nThe 2BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand, loamy sand or their gravelly analogs. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is coarse sand, sand or their gravelly analogues.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon-the zone from the surface to 11 inches (Ap horizon); cambic horizon-the zone from 11 to 14 inches (Bw horizon); calcic horizon-the zone from 26 to 35 inches (2Bk horizon); udic moisture regime.\nThis soil previously was correlated as Estherville or Hawick when occurring as a component in till-outwash complexes or as consociation in morainic landforms in MLRA 103. Soil saturation is either perched or it has a wetting front that occurs between 3.5 to 6 feet from April to June in normal years.\nDrainage class is well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual. Some states would interpret the drainage class as moderately well drained. Drainage class is an interpretation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
