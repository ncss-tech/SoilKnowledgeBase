Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 20 to 69 cm (8 to 27 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in). (A and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 20 to 69 cm (8 to 27 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nLithic contact: 69 cm (27 in). (R horizon)\nOther: the clay increase from the Ap to the Bt1 horizon is insufficient for the Paleustolls great group. Depth to identifiable secondary carbonates is 38 cm (15 in).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
