  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rolfe series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in 60 to 150 centimeters of local alluvium and in the underlying glacial drift.  These soils occur in shallow potholes on relatively undissected, gently undulating till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
