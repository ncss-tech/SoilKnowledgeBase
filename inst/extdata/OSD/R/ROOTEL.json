  "OVERVIEW": "The Rootel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium weathered from calcareous argillite and limestone bedrock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
