Slopes are 5 to 95 percent. These soils formed in tephra over colluvium and residuum weathered from andesite, dacite and rhyodacite. Elevation is 6675 to 10450 feet (2035 to 3186 m). Mean annual precipitation is 69 to 125 inches (1753 to 3175 mm). The mean annual temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F (4 to 5 degrees C). Frost free season is 50 to 85 days."
