  "OVERVIEW": "The Russ series consists of very deep, well drained soils on natural levee positions, lower alluvial flats, and floodplains of alluvial plains. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1015 mm (40 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
