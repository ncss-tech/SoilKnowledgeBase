  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redhome soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and footslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff, andesite, or basalt with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 5,400 to 6,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
