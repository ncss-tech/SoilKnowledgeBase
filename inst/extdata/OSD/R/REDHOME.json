  "OVERVIEW": "The Redhome series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Redhome soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
