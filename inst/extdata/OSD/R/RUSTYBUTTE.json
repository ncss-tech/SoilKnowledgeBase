  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent total rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and may include all or part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly clay loam averaging 27 to 30 percent clay.  It has 15 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly clay loam, very gravelly silty clay loam, or extremely cobbly clay loam averaging 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 40 percent gravel, 20 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rustybutte soils occur on metastable broad ridgetops and active side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from serpentinized metasedimentary or serpentinized metavolcanic rock types.  Elevations are 200 to 1,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."
