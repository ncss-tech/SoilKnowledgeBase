Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline in the A and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam with clay content ranging from 10 to 24 percent.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.  Exclusive of coarse fragments, it is sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe lower Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay.  Clay content ranges from 25 to 40 percent but averages 25 to 35 percent in the upper 20 inches of the argillic.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe 2CBk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 2 to 8.

Grandfield and Grandmore soils do not have gravel within 80 inches.  Honeycreek soils have a lithic contact 40 to 60 inches deep.  Hye and Lou soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic and paralithic contact respectively.  McKnight soils are 40 to 60 inches to shale and do not have a gravelly substratum.  Menard soils contain less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon and are not underlain by gravel within 80 inches.  Bronte and Callahan soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.
