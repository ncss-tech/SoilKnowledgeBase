  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosine series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and underlying residuum weathered from shale, which in places is interbedded with thin strata of siltstone.  Permeability is moderately slow.  They are on side slopes and narrow hilltops.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to soft siltstone or shale ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Except where limed, the soil ranges from strongly to very strongly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon.  Sandstone, siltstone, and shale channers range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and up to 60 percent in the C horizon, and range from 1/4 inch to 15 inches long.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Cultivated soils have an Ap horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam in uneroded pedons and silty clay loam in severely eroded pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Textures are silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown and gray.  The textures are silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, and 2.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Textures are silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and their channery and very channery analogues.  Some pedons have 2BC horizons with color and texture ranges like the 2C."

Eilertsen soils have dark colored surface layers and do not have the channery or shaly textures in the lower part of the solum.  Elk, Elkinsville, Parke, and Pike soils contain less clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are not underlain by shale.  Stonehead soils have more clay and fragments in the lower part of the profile, and the permeability is slow or very slow in the lower part.  Vernonia soils dry for less than 45 consecutive days.  Wellston soils have less clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.   Westmore soils are less acid with base saturation above 60 percent in the lower solum clayey textures in the lower B and C horizon."
