  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in). Free carbonates are at depths of 152 to 254 cm (60 to 100 in) or more. The underlying till has calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 percent or less.  Base saturation is above 60 percent in the lower part of the solum or C horizon. The depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 36 to 76 cm (14 to 30 in), but is typically deeper than 50 cm (20 in). Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent by volume above the pan, and 2 to 25 percent in the pan and below it.  They are dominantly sandstone but include shale and some crystalline rocks.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  Reaction ranges, in the A and BE horizons from extremely acid to slightly acid; in the Bt horizon from extremely acid to moderately acid; in the Btx horizons from very strongly acid to neutral; in the BC horizon from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline; and in the C horizon from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3. Some pedons have an A horizon 3 to 13 cm (1 to 5 in) thick that has a value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, is mixed in the Ap in some cultivated areas.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4, and has redoximorphic features. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe BE or B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 to 6. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 6; and has few to many redoximorphic features. Ped faces have hues of 10YR to 5Y with dominant chroma of 2 or less. Texture commonly is loam or silt loam, but subhorizons of clay loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly phases of these textures are permitted. Structure is weak or moderate subangular or angular blocky with primary structure of weak or moderate fine to coarse prismatic in some pedons.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 or 4, and redoximorphic features. It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam; or their gravelly analogues.\nThe BC horizon is similar to the Btx or 2Btx in color and texture but lacks brittleness.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam; or their gravelly analogues."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abbottstown, Buckingham, Gresham, Portville, and Venango series. Abbottstown soils have a lithic contact within 60 in and hue of 5YR or redder in the B horizon. Buckingham soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the C horizon. Gresham soils typically have thicker sola. Portville soils lack crystalline rock fragments and are formed in colluvium. Venango soils lack a horizon above the fragipan that has clay films."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ravenna soils are formed in Wisconsinan age till on till plains. They are extensive on broad, nearly level to gently sloping base slopes and interfluves. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Soils developed in till with a thin mantle of loess in some places. The underlying till has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 percent or less. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in) and mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F)."

The moderately well drained Canfield soils and well drained Wooster soils are formed in similar soil materials and are on higher and steeper areas nearby. The poorly drained Frenchtown soils formed in similar soil materials and are in nearby low areas and drainage ways. Fitchville and Jimtown soils lack fragipans and are on nearby terrace treads and risers."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low in the fragipan and below.  In undisturbed areas the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table is at 18 to 28 cm (7 to 11 in) during October to June in normal years."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Future MLRA projects have been set up in NASIS to investigate the use of Ravenna in MLRAs 111E and 140.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of about 38 cm (15 in) (Ap, BE horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - from a depth of 38 to 122 cm (15 to 48 in) (Bt, Btx1, Btx2, Btx3 horizons).\n3. Fragipan - 56 to 122 cm (22 to 48 in) (Btx1, Btx2, Btx3 horizons).\n4. Redoximorphic features - 23 to 188 cm (9 to 74 in).\nNote: 09/2014- Changed OSD type location from Wayne Co. OH to Trumbull Co. OH because depth to the fragipan is more representative of aggregated data for this series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Ravenna series can be found at the NCSS Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
