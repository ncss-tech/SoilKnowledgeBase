The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 30 percent rock fragments, and greater than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to bedrock is typically greater than 60 inches, but some pedons range from 40 to 60 inches deep.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  It is gravelly loam with 15 to 27 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent (2 to 5 millimeters) manganese concretions.  Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly silty clay loam, cobbly silty clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 20 to 40 percent (2 to 5 millimeters) manganese concretions.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 6 to 8 moist and dry.  It is gravelly silty clay loam, cobbly silty clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, 10 to 30 percent soft rock fragments, and 30 to 40 percent (2 to 5 millimeters) manganese concretions.
