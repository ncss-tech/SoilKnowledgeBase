The mean\nannual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to\nbedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The solum is neutral or mildly\nalkaline.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to\nthe Bt horizon is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry\nand chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
