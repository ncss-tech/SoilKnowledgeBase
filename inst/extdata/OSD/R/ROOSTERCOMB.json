The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to\nthe Bt horizon is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry\nand chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 40 to 50 percent\ngravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or loam\nwith 25 to 35 percent clay.
