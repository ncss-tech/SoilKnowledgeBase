    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 52 degrees F. The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days). The soil between depths of 6 to 18 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 until November 10 (145 days).  The soil moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. Mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2 or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 7.5YR 3/2. It has 20 to 27 percent clay and O to 13 percent rock fragments. Cobbles range from O to 10 percent. Pebbles range from O to 5 percent. Content of organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent in the surface 10 inches.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4 or 5/4. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline. The Bt horizon has between 40 to 65 percent clay, but the weighted average of the textural control section ranges from 60 to 65 percent clay and O to 5 percent rock fragments. Cobbles range from O to 2 percent. Pebbles range from O to 3 percent. Bt has an increase of 15 to 20 percent clay within a distance of 2.5 cm at the upper boundary."
