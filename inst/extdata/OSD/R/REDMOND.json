  "OVERVIEW": "The Redmond series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in ash over material weathered from basalt, andesite, and sandstone.  Redmond soils are on lava plains and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soils are usually dry, and are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 120 to 150 days commulative.  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  Reaction of the profile is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Mycelial lime is lacking in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 10 to 30 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.\nThe 2B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or cobbly loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."
