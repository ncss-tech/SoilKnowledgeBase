The soils are usually dry, and are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 120 to 150 days commulative.  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  Reaction of the profile is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Mycelial lime is lacking in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 10 to 30 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.\nThe 2B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or cobbly loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in ash and over material weathered from basalt, rhyolite, andesite and sandstone.  The climate is semiarid with cool winters and warm dry summers with a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., mean winter temperature is 32 to 34 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 70 to 130 days."
