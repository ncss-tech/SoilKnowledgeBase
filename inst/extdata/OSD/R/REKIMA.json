  "OVERVIEW": "The Rekima series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils on basalt plains and buttes. They formed in thin eolian and alluvial deposits. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
