  "OVERVIEW": "The Rossmoor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Rossmoor soils are on high floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F at 20 inches and remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 7 inches and 23 inches in most years from May 15 to October 15, moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  Weighted average clay content of the textural control section is 5 to 15 percent.  Content of fine sand and coarser materials is greater than 45 percent.  This soil lacks stratification and organic matter decreases regularly with depth.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent at a depth of 60 inches or more.  Content of gravel is 0 to 3 percent throughout.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline throughout.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, or 3/2.  Clay content is 5 to 15 percent.  Organic matter is 2 to 3 percent.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/4, 5/4, or 4/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/4.   Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay content."
