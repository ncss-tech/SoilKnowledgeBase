    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F at 20 inches and remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 7 inches and 23 inches in most years from May 15 to October 15, moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  Weighted average clay content of the textural control section is 5 to 15 percent.  Content of fine sand and coarser materials is greater than 45 percent.  This soil lacks stratification and organic matter decreases regularly with depth.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent at a depth of 60 inches or more.  Content of gravel is 0 to 3 percent throughout.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline throughout.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, or 3/2.  Clay content is 5 to 15 percent.  Organic matter is 2 to 3 percent.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/4, 5/4, or 4/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/4.   Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay content."

The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 to 62 degrees F.  Average January temperature is 46 degrees F and average July temperature is 76 degrees F.  The freeze free season is 275 to 300 days."
