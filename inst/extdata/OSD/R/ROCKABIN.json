  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockabin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Rockabin soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
