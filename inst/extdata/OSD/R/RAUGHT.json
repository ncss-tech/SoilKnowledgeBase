  "OVERVIEW": "The Raught series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  Raught soils are on foothills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The particle-size control  section averages 5 to 20 percent rock fragments.  Bulk density is less than 0.95 g/cc in the upper 7 to 14 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  The upper 20 inches is 5 to 20 percent coarse fragments and the horizon is as much as l5 percent pebbles and 20 percent cobbles below.

These soils have a base saturation (by sum of cations) of less than 30 percent to a depth of 94 inches.  Characterization data are available on these soils, Laboratory number S84WA-069-003.  The moisture regime is assumed to be udic bordering on xeric.  These soils would be in a Vitrandic subgroup if such were provided in Palehumults."
