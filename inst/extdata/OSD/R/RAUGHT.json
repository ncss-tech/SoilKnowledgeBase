The particle-size control  section averages 5 to 20 percent rock fragments.  Bulk density is less than 0.95 g/cc in the upper 7 to 14 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  The upper 20 inches is 5 to 20 percent coarse fragments and the horizon is as much as l5 percent pebbles and 20 percent cobbles below.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid."

Raught soils formed in colluvium material weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  The climate is  marine characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  The average January temperature is 37 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 6l degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F) is l50 to 200 days.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 200 to 240 days."

These soils have a base saturation (by sum of cations) of less than 30 percent to a depth of 94 inches.  Characterization data are available on these soils, Laboratory number S84WA-069-003.  The moisture regime is assumed to be udic bordering on xeric.  These soils would be in a Vitrandic subgroup if such were provided in Palehumults.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
