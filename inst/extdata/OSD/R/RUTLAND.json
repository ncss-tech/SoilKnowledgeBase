The loess or silty material is 89 to 140 cm (35 to 55 inches) thick. The mollic epipedon is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick. and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon in some pedons. The particle-size control section averages between 35 and 45 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist (3 through 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nAn AB or BA horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4 and contains redoximorphic features. Chroma of 2 or less is present in the matrix or in redoximorphic features in all subhorizons. The horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay in the upper part and silty clay loam or silt loam in the lower part. It is slightly acid to strongly acid in the upper part and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part and contains carbonates in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt, 2BC, or 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR through 5G, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6 and contains redoximorphic features. It is silty clay or clay. It is neutral to moderately alkaline and contains carbonates in most pedons.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR through 5G, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is silty clay or clay and ranges from 40 to 65 percent clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rutland soils are on ground moraines or lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. They are nearly level to undulating. Slope gradient is 0 to 7 percent. The soil formed in 89 to 140 cm (35 to 55 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying clayey till or lacustrine sediments. The climate is mid-continental with hot summers and cold winters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1020 mm (30 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, elevation ranges from 183 to 311 meters (600 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kernan, Streator, Swygert, and Wenona soils. Kernan soils are on similar nearby landscapes. They formed under timber vegetation and lack a mollic epipedon. The poorly drained Streator soils are on lower positions of the landscape. Swygert soils are on nearby landscapes where the loess or silty material is thinner. The moderately well drained Wenona soils are on higher positions on the landscape."

An intermittent perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low on the nearly level slopes and medium on the undulating slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the lower part of the solum and moderately low 0.14 to less than 0.42 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderately slow and slow in the solum and very slow in the underlying material."
