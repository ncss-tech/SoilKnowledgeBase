  "OVERVIEW": "The Rutland series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying clayey till or lacustrine sediments on ground moraines or lake plains. They are deep to a densic contact with till or lacustrine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
