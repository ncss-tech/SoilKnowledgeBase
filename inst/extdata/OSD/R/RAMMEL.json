  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches, and the thickness of the solum and the depth to calcareous material range from 20 to 35 inches.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry for at least 45 consecutive days during mid and late summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 57 to 60 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is commonly loam, with most areas somewhat gravelly or angular cobbly and slightly to extremely stony.  This horizon is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  This horizon is mainly loam or heavy loam and averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  It is gravelly channery, cobbly or stony.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.  The horizon is s1ightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon ranges from about 3 to 15 percent in carbonates and has more than 50 percent rock fragments in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amsden, Crogdon, Dra, Gelkie, Hourglass, Rezar, Leavitt, Lucky, Lymanson, Lyonman, Michelson, Miracle, Monad, Morset, Mult, Newlands, Passcreek, Philipsburg, Sponseller, Tingey, Tripit, Wellsville, Woosley, and Youga series.  Amsden, Croydon, Gelkie, Hourglass, Leavitt, Lyonman, Michelson, Monad, Morset, Philipsburg, Tingey, Wellsville, and Youga soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Dra soils have more than 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and have developed from sandstone.  Kezar soils have a large proportion of coarse and very coarse angular sand and are extremely hard when air dry.  Lucky, Mult, and Newlands soils are noncalcareous in the lower part of the solum, and lack continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.   Lymanson and Tripit soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches. Miracle and Sponseller soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a major part of the control section.  Passcreek soils have a solum less than 20 inches thick and formed in parent sediments derived from sandstone and shale with only small amounts of limestone.  Woosley soils have 5 to 15 percent fine limestone gravel in all parts of the soil profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rammel soils are on uplands and have gradients of 2 to 80 percent, dominantly 15 to 50 percent. They formed from very and extremely stony, medium textured material weathered from rhyolite, latite, or rhyolitic tuff, in places with admixture of loess.  Elevations are about 5,900 to 7,000 feet.  The climate is cool subhumid continental having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 50 to 90 days."

Greys soils have an A2 or A and B horizon, lack rock fragments, and contain less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Judkins soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Karlan soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 16 inches, and lack an argillic horizon.  Swanner soils are less than 20 incbes deep to bedrock."
