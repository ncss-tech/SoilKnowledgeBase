  "OVERVIEW": "The Roscoe series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey Pleistocene alluvium, on nearly level swales on alluvial plain remnants in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16.1 degree C (61 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in).",
