The particle-size control section averages 18 to 24 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap or A) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content is 18 to 24 percent, and sand content is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nMany pedons have an AB or a BA horizon.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bw) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture typically is silt loam, but some pedons are loam in some thin subhorizons.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe lower part of the series control section (C) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons contain color or textural strata.  Textures in the strata are sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have buried soils below a depth of about 60 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

The well drained Drury soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar parts of the landform nearby.  The somewhat poorly drained Dupo and Radford soils have buried soils within a depth of 40 inches.  Both of these soils are on flood plains below the Raddle soils.  The well drained Haymond and somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are on nearly level flood plains nearby.  They both do not have a mollic epipedon and contain less clay in the control section.  The well drained Worthen soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are on similar landform positions nearby."
