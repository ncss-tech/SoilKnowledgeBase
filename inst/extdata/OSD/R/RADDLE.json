  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development typically is 50 to 65 inches, but ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches in thickness and commonly includes the BA or AB horizon.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 24 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap or A) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content is 18 to 24 percent, and sand content is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nMany pedons have an AB or a BA horizon.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bw) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture typically is silt loam, but some pedons are loam in some thin subhorizons.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe lower part of the series control section (C) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons contain color or textural strata.  Textures in the strata are sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have buried soils below a depth of about 60 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Corbolt, Keg, Monona, Ponca, Sac, Salix, and Truman soils contain carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Exira, Galva, Marshall, Nira, and Northboro soils contain more than 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Port Byron soils have a regular decrease in clay with increasing depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes commonly are 0 to 3 percent but range to as steep as 10 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 49 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 32 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 160 to 200 days, and elevation is 340 to 550 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coffeen, Drury, Dupo, Haymond, Radford, Wakeland, and Worthen soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Coffeen soils are on similar parts of the landform or are on lower lying, nearly level flood plains.  The well drained Drury soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar parts of the landform nearby.  The somewhat poorly drained Dupo and Radford soils have buried soils within a depth of 40 inches.  Both of these soils are on flood plains below the Raddle soils.  The well drained Haymond and somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are on nearly level flood plains nearby.  They both do not have a mollic epipedon and contain less clay in the control section.  The well drained Worthen soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are on similar landform positions nearby."
