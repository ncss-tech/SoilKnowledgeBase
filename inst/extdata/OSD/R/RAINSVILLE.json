  "OVERVIEW": "The Rainsville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep or very deep to dense till. The Rainsville soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash and till. They are on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
