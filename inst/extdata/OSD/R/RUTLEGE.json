The Dawhoo, Johnston, Osier, Pickney, Plummer, Lynn Haven, Scarboro, and Torhunta series are similar soils in related families.  Dawhoo soils have mixed mineralogy.  Johnston and Pickney soils have umbric epipedons that are more than 24 inches thick.  Osier and Plummer soils do not have an umbric epipedon.  The Lynn Haven soils have spodic horizons. Scarboro soils have average annual soil temperatures of 47 to 59 degrees F.  Torhunta soils have sandy loam or fine sandy loam texture in the particle-size control section."
