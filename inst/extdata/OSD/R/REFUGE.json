    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,205 to 4,250 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is about 70 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Leland soils have ochric epipedons and natric horizons.  Sunset soils do not have salic horizons.  Warm Springs soils have calcic horizons."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nSalic horizon - The zone from 8 to 71 inches (Cz1, Cz2, and 2Cz3 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 24 and 40 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Cz2 and 2Cz3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (parts of the Cz1 and Cz2 horizons).\nThe revision of October 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Salidic Haplustolls to Typic Aquisalids based on presence of a salic horizon, saturation within 100 cm, and a moisture control section that is dry in some part.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 142-143, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
