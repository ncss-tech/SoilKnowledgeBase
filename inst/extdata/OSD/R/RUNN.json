    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 35 to 55 inches. Depth to strata of silt loam, silty clay, silty clay\nloam, or very fine sandy loam ranges from 40 to 80 inches. These soils, when dry, have cracks 0.4 to 1.0 inch wide and 12 inches\nor more long that extend to depths of 25 to 40 inches. COLE ranges from 0.07 to 0.17 throughout the solum. Soil salinity ranges from 1.0 to 4.0 dS/m in the surface layer and increases with depth. Salinity is 4 to 16 dS/m in some pedons that are irrigated.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2. Texture is a silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 5 or 6.  Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or silt loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 5 percent and remains relatively constant with depth."
