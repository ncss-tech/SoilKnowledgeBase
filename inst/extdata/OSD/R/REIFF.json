  "OVERVIEW": "The Reiff series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in coarse to medium textured alluvium weathered from mixed sources.  Reiff soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 5 and 22 inches is dry in all parts from June to November and moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  Thin silt, sand and gravel lenses are common in the profile.  Gravel content in some or all horizons range up to 30 percent, but most pedons have little if any gravel.  Few faint mottles occur within the profile of some pedons.  Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth.  Some pedons have fine stratification below 6 inches.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/4, 3/3, 3/2, 2/2; 7.5YR 3/4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Organic matter contant is more than one percent and some orall of the horizon is massive and hard when dry.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 3/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4, 3/2.  It is stratified sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline and may be calcareous."

Arvin and Steuber soils have an organic matter content of less than 1 percent in the A horizon.  In addition, Arvin soils have more than 15 percent very coarse plus coarse sand.  Steuber soils have soil temperatures less than 47 degrees F. in the winter months.  Maywood soils have A horizons with moist values of 4 or more.  San Emigdio soils are calcareous throughout the 10 to 20 inch zone."

These soils will probably be reclassified as mollisols when re-mapped.  Soils mapped in the San Diego Area report are now excluded from the range of the Reiff concept due to having more than 15 percent very coarse plus coarse sand."
