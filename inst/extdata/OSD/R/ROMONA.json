  "OVERVIEW": "The Romona series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and in the underlying residuum from limestone. The Romona soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
