  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to more than 60 inches.  The series control section typically is silty clay loam or silt loam averaging between 25 and 35 percent clay.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  From 10 to 20 percent of the calcium carbonate is clay-size carbonates.  Some pedons have mottles throughout.  An 0 horizon up to 6 inches thick is on some pedons.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral; value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or less.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam with high organic matter content. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Ak and Bkg horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral; value of 2 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry; and chroma of 1 or less.  Some pedons have chroma of 2 with mottles.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam, but is silty clay, clay loam, or loam  below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is stratified gravelly sand with thin layers of gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, and clay loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have 2C horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Downata, Halleck, Inkom, Lamoure, and Playmoor series.  Downata and Halleck soils have violent effervescence at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are drier in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  In addition Downata soils have a high water table of 0 to 18 inches from January to June.  Inkom soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle size control section. Lamoure soils typically have mottles within depths of 40 inches and are poorly drained.  Playmoor soils have many salt accumulations in the upper part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rauville soils are on flat to nearly level low bottom lands along streams and drainageways.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  They formed in calcareous, silty recent alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2900."

Lamoure, Playmoor, and Marysland soils are on slightly higher positions on bottom lands.  The Divide, Fordville, Renshaw, and Spottswood soils are underlain by sand and gravel at depths less than 40 inches and are on higher adjacent landscapes.  Ladelle soils have a drier soil moisture control section and are on higher position on the landscape.  Marysland soils have calcic horizons within 16 inches.   Oldham soils have a fine textured series control section.  Parnell soils have a fine textured control section and have argillic horizons. The Oldham and Parnell are poorly drained soils in depressions."

These soils have a water table that typically is at or near the surface and is within 2 feet of the surface even in periods of drought. A ponded phase is recognized in which up to 2 feet of water is on the surface."
