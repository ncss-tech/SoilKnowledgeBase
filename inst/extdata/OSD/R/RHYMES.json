  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

Permeability is rapid in the fine sand A and E horizons, moderately rapid in the loamy fine sand A and E horizons and moderately slow in the Bt horizons.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes. A perched water table occurs at the contact of the Bt horizon in some years. When present, the water table occurs after heavy rainfall during the winter and spring months. Typically the water table is less than 6 inches thick and persists for very brief or brief periods."

Native vegetation consists of grasses such as little bluestem, brownseed paspalum, Indiangrass, switchgrass, tanglehead, fringeleaf paspalum, and hooded windmillgrass. Woody vegetation consists mainly of live oaks, scattered mesquite, pricklypear, and catclaw acacia.  (Ecological site name: Sandy 22-35\" Pz;\nEcological site number: R083AY406TX)"
