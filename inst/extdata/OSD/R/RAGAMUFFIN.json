  "OVERVIEW": "The Ragamuffin series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  Ragamuffin soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
