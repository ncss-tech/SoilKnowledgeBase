  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pecos series.  Pecos soils have gypsum crystals.  The Arno, Cogswell, Frio, Guest, and Nipsum series are in similar families.  Arno soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Cogswell and Frio soils have a calcic horizon.  Guest soils are moist for less than 45 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is above 5 degrees C.  Nipsum soils have a cambic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Riggs soils are on level to nearly level alluvial fans and flood plains at elevations of 2400 to 5000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in stream or fan alluvium from volcanic, sedimentary and granitic rock.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rains. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 69 degrees F.  The frost- free period is 180 to 280 days."
