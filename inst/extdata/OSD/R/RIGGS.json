  "OVERVIEW": "The Riggs series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stream or fan alluvium from volcanic, granitic and sedimentary rock. Riggs soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Arno soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Cogswell and Frio soils have a calcic horizon.  Guest soils are moist for less than 45 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is above 5 degrees C.  Nipsum soils have a cambic horizon."

These soils formed in stream or fan alluvium from volcanic, sedimentary and granitic rock.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rains. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 69 degrees F.  The frost- free period is 180 to 280 days."
