  "OVERVIEW": "The Raggedrock series consists of deep, well-drained soils on planar lower to middle backslopes of mountains.  Raggedrock soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum from granite. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
