  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are extremely acid and clayey throughout.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 34 inches.  Thickness of the argillic horizons range from 18 to 26 inches.  Depth to the hard bedded siltstone is over 3 feet.  These soils are slightly sticky and slightly plastic throughout.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic.  Organic matter content is 1.5 percent or less in the top 6 inches of the argillic horizon.  CEC is more than 24 meq/100 grams of clay in the argillic horizon.\nColors of the A horizons have hues of 7.5YR and 5YR, values and chromas of 3 and 4.\nThe Bt horizons have colors in hues of 5YR, 2.5YR and 10R, values of 4 and 5 and chromas of 6 and 8.  Structure ranges from moderate coarse to medium subangular blocky.  Clay films vary from few faint to many prominent."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Corozal, Consumo, Maricao, Lirios, Moca, Alonso, Ingenio, Jagueyes and Vega Alta series.  The Corozal soils have low chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The Consumo, Maricao and Lirios soils have thinner argillic horizons.  The Moca soils have clays with COLE values greater than 0.09.  The Alonso, Ingenio, and Jagueyes soils have lower exchange capacity values.  The Vega Alta soils have more than 5 percent nonindurated plinthite within 60 inches of the surface."

The regolith consists of fine textured residuum from thin bedded siltstone and shale.  The climate is humid tropical. The average annual precipitation is 80 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 78 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is more than 71.6 degrees F with a difference less than 9 degrees F between mean summer and mean winter temperatures."
