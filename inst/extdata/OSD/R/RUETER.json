  "OVERVIEW": "The Rueter series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from cherty limestone on steep side slopes and narrow ridgetops.   Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
