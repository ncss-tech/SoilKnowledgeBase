  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from cherty limestone or interbedded sandstone and cherty dolomite.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F."
