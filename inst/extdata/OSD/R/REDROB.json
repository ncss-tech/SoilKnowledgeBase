  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F.  The solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches thick over the 2C horizon.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches. Mottles range from few to many, fine to large, and distinct or prominent above 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the solum range from 0 to 25 percent, and in some pedons they may have enough rock fragments to be a gravelly type.  The upper part of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent clay, with fine sand and coarser ranging from 15 to 45 percent.  A water table fluctuates within the 2C horizon and rises to within one foot of the surface during peak spring runoff.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 dry, and 2 through 5 moist.  It is stratified loam, sandy loam and loamy sand.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and are mainly pebbles but include some cobbles and a few stones.  This horizon is neutral through moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redrob soils are on low terraces and flood plains and have slope gradients of 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium from a variety of sources.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,800 feet.  The frost-free period is 80 to 105 days.  In Wyoming annual precipitation ranges down to 12 inches."

Shawa and Straw soils are well drained soils on higher terrace and fan positions and lack a sandy and gravelly 2C horizon within the particle-size control section.  Vanda soils lack a mollic epipedon and a have a fine particle-size control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision updates the classification from a Fluvaquentic Haplaquoll to a Fluvaquentic Endoaquoll.  (1992 Keys to Soil Taxonomy.) Diagnostic features include a mollic epipedon from 0 to 17 inches and sandy-skeletal material at 35 inches.  It has stratification in the 17 to 35 inch layer, redox features in all layers below 17 inches; an irregular decrease in organic carbon below 17 inches; an aquic moisture regime; and a frigid temperature regime.  Last revised by the state on 4/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
