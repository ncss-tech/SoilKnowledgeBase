  "OVERVIEW": "The Rossi series consists of very deep, poorly drained saline-sodic soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary rock sources.  These soils are in nearly level basins.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 10 inches, the average temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
