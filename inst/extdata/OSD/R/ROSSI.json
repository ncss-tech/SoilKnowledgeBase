They are in areas that have a dry subhumid mesothermal climate.  Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 77 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages from 250 to 280 days."
