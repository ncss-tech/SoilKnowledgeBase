These soils formed in residuum weathered from red tuff strata of the Duff and Pruett Formations, and also occur on chert and basalt. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring from July through September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period is 170 to 275 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,500 feet."

This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals in the Duff and Pruett Tuffs.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nUpdate and revisions for the recorrelation of Brewster County, Texas, Main Part, 2/8/2008, CEM.\nRevised for the correlation of Presidio County, Texas ; Oct, 2012, WWJ\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
