Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
