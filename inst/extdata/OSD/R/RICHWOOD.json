  "OVERVIEW": "The Richwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains and stream terraces. Richwood soils formed in 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying water-laid stratified fine and medium sand. These soils have moderate permeability in the loess or silty deposits and rapid permeability in the underlying stratified sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 79 centimeters (31 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
