  "OVERVIEW": "The Remmit series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in wind reworked alluvium derived from sandstone sediments.  Remmit soils are on terraces, fans and uplands on plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The weighted average of organic carbon in the upper 10 inches is 0.5 to 1.0 percent.  Depth to calcareous soil material ranges from 8 to 15 inches.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, chromas of 3 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam.  Clay films may be observable on surfaces of peds and in pores.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.  Texture is loam or sandy loam."
