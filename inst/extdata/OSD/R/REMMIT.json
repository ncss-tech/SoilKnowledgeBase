The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay, and 45 to 55 percent fine sand and coarser.  The weighted average of organic carbon in the upper 10 inches is 0.5 to 1.0 percent.  Depth to calcareous soil material ranges from 8 to 15 inches.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, chromas of 3 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam.  Clay films may be observable on surfaces of peds and in pores.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.  Texture is loam or sandy loam."

Laboratory sampling (1991) [sample 91P5247-5254] confirmed this soil as a coarse-loamy Ustollic Camborthid with  some oriented clay argillians in the subsoil which are not qualifying for an argillic horizon.  The Cambic horizon ranges from 4 to 22 inches.  Last updated by the state 12/91.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 12/91.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
