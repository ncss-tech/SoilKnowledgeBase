  "OVERVIEW": "The Rolo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over weathered quartz diorite residuum.  They are on mountain side slopes. Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 10 to 35 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
