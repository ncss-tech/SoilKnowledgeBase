Except for Garloaf, the remaining soils are on similar landscape positions. Bluejay soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Cedarpines and Greenspot soils do not have a mollic epipedon. Garloaf soils are on alluvial fans associated with mountain slopes, have an argillic horizon and a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. Hannarocks and Heapspeak soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 centimeters thick. In addition, Hannarocks has a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. Pacificrest soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact."
