  "STATES": "MT,ND,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ringling series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in materials derived from burned shale, burned sandstone, argillite or from porcelanite.  They are 12 to 20 inches deep over fragmental material.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
