  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic or lithic contact is 40 to 60 inches. Depth to horizons with more than 35 percent clay (2Bt) ranges from 30 to 45 inches. Average clay content in the particle-size control section ranges from 30 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Redoximorphic features are in lower subhorizons. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon hue is typically 7.5YR or 10YR, but ranges to 5YR. Value is 4 to 6 and chroma is 3 to 8. Texture commonly is silty clay or clay and less commonly silty clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

Birkbeck, Cadiz, Campton, Elco, Hedrick, Homen, Inton, Iona, Libre, Mayville, Minnith, Morningsun (T), Newvienna, Redbud, Rockfield, Somonauk, Uniontown, Winfield, and Zurich soils do not have a paralithic or lithic contact above a depth of 60 inches. Eleroy soils have a paralithic contact with calcareous, clayey shale at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rocheport soils are on moderately steep to steep side slopes, generally the upper parts, of hills in uplands. They have formed in loess, thought to be Holocene, and residuum from limestone or dolostone that is low in chert content. The underlying bedrock is thought to be primarily Ordovician or Mississippian in age. Slopes range from 14 to 40 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Bonnefemme, Clinkenbeard, Menfro series and the moderately well drained Winfield series. Bonnefemme and Clinkenbeard soils are generally down slope from the Rocheport soils, are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock, and have a finer texture argillic horizon. Menfro and Winfield soils are generally up slope and are more than 60 inches to bedrock."
