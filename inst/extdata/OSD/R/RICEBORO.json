  "REVDATE": "10/2003",
  "STATES": "GA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Riceboro series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey marine sediments.  They occur on nearly level broad flats and in slight depressions of the Atlantic Coastal Flatwoods.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.",

Reaction of the soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is N 3/0.

Mottles in shades of brown, red, and yellow range from few to many.  In some pedons the lower part is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red.  Few to common pockets of loamy sand or fine sand are present in the lower B2t horizon.  Texture is commonly sandy clay but ranges to clay in some pedons."

Competing series in similar families include Alapaha, Bethera, Bladen, Ellabelle, Ogeechee, Pelham, Plummer and Pooler.  Alapaha, Ellabelle, Pelham and Plummer soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Alapaha soils have more than 5 percent plinthite in some part of the B horizon above the 60 inch depth; Ellabelle soils have an umbric epipedon and Plummer soils have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick.  Bethera, Bladen, Ogeechee, and Pooler soils are not arenic."

These soils formed in sandy and clayey marine sediments mainly on the Pamlico and Talbot terraces.  The mean annual temperature is about 63 to 70 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 45 to 55 inches.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent."

Bayboro and Cape Fear soils have an umbric epipedon.  Bladen and Wahee soils do not have a sandy epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Mascotte soils are on the same landscape but have a spodic horizon above the argillic horizon.  Ocilla soils are higher on the landscape, somewhat poorly drained, and have a loamy control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Riceboro soils are poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid in the A horizons and slow in the Btg horizon.  The water table is at depths less than 1 foot for 3 to 5 months in most years.  Water may stand on the surface very briefly after heavy rains.  Source of flood water is from adjacent slow moving, poorly defined streams."
