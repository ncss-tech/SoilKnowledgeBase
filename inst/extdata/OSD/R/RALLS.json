Soft powdery segregated lime is at a depth of 36 to 60 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Texture is very cobbly silt loam, stony silt loam, gravelly silt loam or silt loam. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon and BCt horizon, when present, has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam, silt loam or loam with 10 to 45 percent cobbles and gravel. It has continuous or patchy clay films. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nA Bk horizon is present in some pedons with value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or clay loam with 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent.
