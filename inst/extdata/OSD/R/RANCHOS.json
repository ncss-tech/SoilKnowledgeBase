    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Current competitors are the Begay, Delvalle, Ignacio, Kitsili, Koshare, Ojito, Parida, Remmit, Sandspring, and Turnback series.  The Begay, Kitsili, and Sandspring series contain carbonates throughout the profiles.  Delvalle, Koshare, Ojito, Parida, and Sandspring contain greater amounts of gravels in their particle size control sections, within which, Koshare contains 10 to 25 percent mica.  Ignacio, Ojito, and Turnback series are moderately deep to bedrock.  The Remmit series has yellower hues and occurs under cooler average annual temperatures."
