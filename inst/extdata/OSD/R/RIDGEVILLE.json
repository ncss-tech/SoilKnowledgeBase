  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 89 to 140 cm (35 to 55 inches). The mollic epipedon is 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches) thick. The particle-size control section typically contains about 16 to 18 percent clay and between 45 and 70 percent total sand. Some pedons have as little as 12 percent clay, and others have thin subhorizons containing as much as 18 to 22 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture commonly is fine sandy loam but the range includes sandy loam, loam, and loamy sand. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid, except where the soil has been limed.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or less commonly 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid. Some pedons have an AB horizon of rather than a BA horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, and has redoximorphic features. Texture dominantly is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam, and includes the fine and very fine analogs. In some pedons the lower part is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 2 to 8. Redoximorphic features can have value as low as 3. Textures are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Cg or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 2 to 8. Texture commonly is fine sand or sand, and can contains strata of loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, coarse sand, and fine gravel. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in the family. Other series in closely related families are the Gilford, Hoopeston, La Hogue, and Onarga. Gilford and Hoopeston soils do not have argillic horizons. In addition, Gilford soils have lower chroma in the B horizon and are poorly drained. La Hogue soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Onarga soils have higher chroma in the B horizon and do not have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ridgeville soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and beach ridges on lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slope gradients commonly are 1 or 2 percent, but they range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in outwash or eolian deposits. Mean annual air temperature ranges from9 to 13 degrees C ( 48 to 56 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 1020 mm (32 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 155 to 290 meters (510 to 950 feet) above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing La Hogue and Onarga soils, and the Brenton, Proctor, Roby, and Selma soils. The well drained Onarga soils and the poorly drained Selma soils form a drainage sequence with Ridgeville soils. Brenton and Proctor soils contain more silt and less sand in the upper part of the series control section. Roby soils do not have mollic epipedons and form a biosequence with Ridgeville soils. They are on nearby similar landforms."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. An apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.34 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the series control section, and high or very high (14.11 to 141.14 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part of the series control section, and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part."
