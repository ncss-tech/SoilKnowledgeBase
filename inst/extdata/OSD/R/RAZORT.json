  "OVERVIEW": "The Razort series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeabile soils.  They formed in silty alluvium on level or nearly level flood plains and low terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, or clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Some pedons are mottled with chromas of 1 or 2 below 36 inches. Texture is silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has similar colors as the Bt horizon, but has gravelly textures.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has similar colors as the Bt horizon. Texture is silt loam or loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe underlying 2C horizon is variable in texture.  Colors are similar as the Bt horizon. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

Baltimore soils have Bt horizons with redder hue.  Bassett, Blooming, and Racine soils formed in two materials that are typically separated by a stone line. Caleb soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F., and formed in pre-Sangamon sediments of variable texture. Dunbridge, Newcomer, and Winneshiek soils have a lithic or paralithic contact from 20 to 40 inches. Dowagiac, Lauramie, Longlois, and Taopi soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Lydick soils are more acid, contain shale fragments and more sand in the C horizons.  Mohawk soils have a higher content of silt and have free carbonates from 20 to 60 inches. Neda soils are underlain by stratified coarser textured material. Orwood soils are underlain by sandstone.  Oneco and Waucoma soils have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches."
