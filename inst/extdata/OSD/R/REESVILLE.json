    "content": "REMARKS: Reesville soils were previously classified as Aeric Epiaqualfs. Field investigations, including transects, determined that redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less contribute to less than 50 percent of total color for the upper portion of the argillic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 96 cm (Bt, BCt horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features immediately below Ap, but are in less than 50 percent of the matrix to a depth greater than 200 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Information on loess distribution in the vicinity of the Reesville type location is published in the following reference: Hock, A. G., Wilding, L. P., and Hall, G. F. 1973.
