These soils are saturated between the depths of 20 and 40 inches from December through June.  The soil moisture control section (5 to 13 inches) is dry throughout from June 15th to November 15th (153 days).  It is moist in some or all parts the remainder of the year.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 15th to December 1st (261 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from May 1st to November 15th (198 days).\nThe A horizon dry color is (10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3).  Moist color is (10YR 2/1, 3/2 or 3/3.)  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  E.C. ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos. SAR ranges from 5 to 12 percent.\nThe Bk horizons dry colors are (10YR 7/2, 8/2 or 2.5Y 8/2).  Moist colors are (2.5Y 5/4, 6/4 or 10YR 6/4).
