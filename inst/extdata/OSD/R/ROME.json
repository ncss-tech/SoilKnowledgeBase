  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 72 inches.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except those surface horizons which have been limed.  Black concretions range from few to common in the A horizon and from common to many in the Bt horizon.  Flakes of mica range from none to common and fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the solum.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent, but commonly is 25 to 35 percent, and silt content ranges from 25 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4, 5 or 6, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4, 5 or 6; and chroma of 4, 6 or 8.  It is clay loam or loam.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, 5, or 6, and chroma of 3, 4, 6 or 8.  Mottles are common to many fine to coarse reddish, brownish and yellowish.  Some pedons have gray mottles in the Bt3 horizon more than 24 inches below the surface.  The Bt2 and Bt3 horizons are clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has the same matrix color range as the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons with common to many reddish, brownish, yellowish and grayish mottles.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, is mottled red, brown, gray, and white sandy loam or sandy clay loam, including gravelly and very gravelly counterparts."

Apison and Euharlee soils are in a siliceous family.  Altavista and Whitwell soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon.  Cheaha and Sherless soils have bedrock at depths less than 40 inches.  Choccolocco soils have less than 15 percent of the control section as coarse or coarser than fine sand.  Fruithurst, Rion and Tidings soils have sola that are 20 to 40 inches deep.  Sherwood soils have bedrock at depths less than 60 inches.  State soils have solum thickness of 30 to 60 inches.  Wickham soils have Bt horizons with 5YR or redder hue."
