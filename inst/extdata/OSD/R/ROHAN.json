  "OVERVIEW": "The Rohan series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loamy residuum or colluvium from weathered black fissile shale. Permeability is moderate to moderately slow.  These gently sloping to very steep soils are on ridgecrests, side slopes, and foot slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 8 to 20 inches and depth to hard bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments from 2mm to 15 inches range from 5 to 75 percent in individual horizons and average 35 percent or more in the particle-size control section.  They are weathered and unweathered fragments of carbonaceous fissile shale.  The reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid in the A horizon and from strongly acid to extremely acid in the B and C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, or silty clay loam and their channery and very channery analogues.  When the value and chroma or less 3, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 40 percent.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam and their channery, very channery or extremely channery analogues.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 65 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6 and some pedons are mottled horizon and dominant color and mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow or both.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and their very or extremely channery analogues.  Rock fragments range from about 15 percent to 65 percent.\nThe C horizon, if present, has colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon, and rock fragments range from 15 to 75 percent.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is weathered shale.\nThe R horizon is hard fissile shale."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arnot, Catlett, Dimal, Klinesville, Nassau, Umpcoos, Unicoi, Weikert, and Zango soils in the same family and the Colyer Series in a similar family.  Arnot and Nassau soils formed in a thin mantle of glacial till.  Catlett soils are formed in weathered products of dark gray to brown Jurassic and Triassic hornfel and granulite.  Dimal, Umpcoos, and Zango soils receive from 140 to 180 inches annual precipitation.  Klinesville soils have hues redder than 7.5YR.  Unicoi soils formed over arkose or arkosic sandstone and have a much higher content of feldspar, hydrobiotite, and chlorite.  Weikert soils formed in materials weathered from shale, siltstone, and sandstone and do not have carbonaceous bedrock.  Colyer soils have more than 35 percent clay."
