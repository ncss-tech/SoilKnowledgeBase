Where value is 3 and chroma is 2 or 3, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick. The Ap is loam, silt loam, or their cobbly or channery analogues. Some pedons have an A horizon, 2 to 5 inches thick, that has value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. An E horizon, 2 to 7 inches thick, is present in some pedons. It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The Ap or A horizon and E horizon are neutral to stongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.

Amanda, Coggon, Hayden, Hickory, Lindley, McHenry, Owosso, Pecatonica, Renova, Riddles, Wawasee, and Westville soils contain less coarse fragments in the solum, have coarse fragments of mixed lithology, and have the solum or lower part of the solum formed in till. Belmont, Hebron, Hollinger, Kendallville, Kidder, LeRoy, Mandeville, Miami, Relay, Sisson, Strawn, Theresa, and Wykoff soils have sola less than 42 inches thick. Belmore, Chili, Douds, El Dara, Gallman, Kalamazoo and Ockley soils lack thin flat fragments of sandstone, siltstone, and shale and typically contain more sand and gravel in the lower part of the solum and C horizons and are more stratified in all or part of the solum. Chenault, Roseville, and Woodbine soils have clayey textures from residuum in the lower part of the solum. Conestoga and Letort soils contain mica flakes and coarse fragments of micaeous limestone or schist throughout the solum. Grellton soils lack rock fragments within the series control section and contain less sand in much of the argillic horizon. High Gap, Military, Norden, and Whalan soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Kanawha and Martinsville soils contain less coarse fragments in the solum and are formed in sandy or loamy water sorted material. Mifflin, Princeton, and Skelton soils lack coarse fragments in the solum. In addition, Mifflin soils formed in loamy residuum from sandy limestone and Princeton soils formed in stratified, aeolian silt an d fine sand. Nodine soils have a stratified argillic horizon. Rawson soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the solum or substratum. Summitville soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the lower part of the Bt horizons. In addition, Summitville soils range from strongly to extremely acid in the upper part of the Bt horizons. Hayter soils are more acid and have lower base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Richland soils are on colluvial foot slopes, fans, and benches that have a plane or concave surface. They are gently sloping to steep with slope gradients commonly between 8 and 25 percent with a range of 3 to 40 percent. The soils formed in loamy materials weathered from fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, and shale with minor amounts of limestone which has been mixed by down-slope movement. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 43 inches."

Culleoka and Dekalb soils are on narrow summits and shoulder slopes where fine-grained sandstone bedrock occurs at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Elba soils are on side slopes and benches formed in clayey residuum from limestone, shale, and siltstone, and have free carbonates at a depth of 10 to 30 inches. Lowell soils are on summits, side slopes, and benches, formed in clayey residuum from interbedded limestone, shale, siltstone, and thin layers of sandstone. Westmore soils are on summits, side slopes, and benches. They formed in a silt mantle 20 to 36 inches and the underlying clayey residuum from limestone, shale, and siltstone. Westmoreland soils are on summits, foot slopes, and benches; and have interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and some shale bedrock at depths of 40 to 70 inches. Westmoreland soils also have lower base saturation."

    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only was changed in 11/94, competing series and other changes will be made later.\nThe 01/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data elements for twelve Ohio Counties and not on laboratory data. This data also supports Paleudalfs, based on the RV clay values. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of about 8 inches (Ap and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of about 8 to 55 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory base saturation data is available for the typical pedon and for several additional pedons. Laboratory characterization data is on file for BT-3.\nPrevious revision dates: 11/94-TNR, DRM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
