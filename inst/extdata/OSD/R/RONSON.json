  "OVERVIEW": "The Ronson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from soft calcareous sandstone on uplands.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  In some areas of native grass the upper few inches do not have free carbonate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically fine sandy loam or sandy loam but the range includes loam with less than 18 percent clay. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has 2.5Y or 10YR hue, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It typically is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly to strongly cemented sandstone.  When soft and moist, it is difficult to identify the bedding planes."

The Anselmo, Doger, Holt, Manter, and Rosebud soils are on similar landscapes.  The Anselmo, Doger, and Manter soils do not have sandstone bedrock within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, Doger soils contain more sand and Manter soils have an argillic horizon.  Holt soils have an argillic horizon.  Rosebud soils have a lower mean annual precipitation.  Elsmere soils have a seasonal high water table at depths of 1.5 to 3.0 feet and are on flood plains.  Tassel soils are on steep nearby landscapes and have calcareous sandstone bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Vetal soils are in swales and have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick."
