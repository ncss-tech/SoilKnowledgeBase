  "OVERVIEW": "The Ranion series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands derived from Navajo sandstone. Ranion soils are on dunes of structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
