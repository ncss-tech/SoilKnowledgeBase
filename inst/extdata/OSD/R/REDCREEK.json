  "OVERVIEW": "The Redcreek series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum reworked by wind and weathered from calcareous sandstone.  These soils are on mountain sides, ridges, and hill slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

The average annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon and AC horizons, if present, have hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\n2 - Redcreek Series\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam and may be modified with channers.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
