Sandstone channers range from 0 to 35 percent.  The average annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon and AC horizons, if present, have hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\n2 - Redcreek Series\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam and may be modified with channers.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

These soils formed in residuum partially reworked by wind and weathered from loamy calcareous sandstone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 15 inches.  The frost-free period is 60 to 105 days."
