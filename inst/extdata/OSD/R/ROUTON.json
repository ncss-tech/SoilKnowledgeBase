  "OVERVIEW": "The Routon series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from loess. Routon soils are on low stream terraces and in depressions on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 49 inches.",
