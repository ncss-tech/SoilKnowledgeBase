    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 40 to greater than 65 inches. The A, E and Bt horizons range from slightly acid to very strongly acid and the BC and C horizons range from neutral to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or has value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or is neutral. Iron concentrations and depletions range from few to many in shades of brown, yellow or gray. Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 or less or is neutral. Iron concentrations and depletions range from few to many in shades of brown, yellow or gray. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4. Iron concentrations and depletions range from few to many in shades of brown, yellow, or gray. Some pedons are mottled in shades of these colors without a dominant matrix color. Texture of the BC horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam and the C horizon is silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Norene soils are the only series in the same family. Soils in closely related families include the Acredale, Adaton, Amagon, Dundee, Idee, Olmstead, and Tichnor series. All of these soils are endosaturated, except the Olmstead soils which are in a semiactive CE activity class. Norene soils typically become heavier with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Routon soils are on nearly level stream terraces and in slight upland depressions. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in silty alluvium derived from loess that is greater than 4 feet in thickness. At the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 49 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Bonn, Calhoun, Center, Falaya, Henry, and Waverly series. The somewhat poorly drained Falaya series and the poorly drained Waverly series on adjacent flood plains, and the Bonn series and possibly the Lafe series both of which have high exchangeable sodium in some part of the sola. Calhoun soils have a glossic horizon. Center soils are moderately well drained. Henry soils have a fragipan and are in a coarse-silty textural family."
