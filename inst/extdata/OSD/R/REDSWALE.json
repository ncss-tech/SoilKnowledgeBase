    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to duripan is 4 to 10 inches, (10 to 25 cm).  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F, (17 to 18 degrees C).  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to about October (about 150 to 180 days).  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, mostly cobbles.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from November through March.  Redoximorphic features such as iron-manganese masses, iron-manganese concretions and iron masses occur in A and Bt horizons.  Layers of manganese surface coats 1/16 to 1/8 inch (2 to 3 mm) thick occur on top of the duripan.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 5 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Some pedons have a 1/16 inch (2 mm) thick organic mat on the surface.\nThe A horizon dry color is 5YR 4/6, 5/6, 6/6, 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 7.5YR 3/3 or 2.5YR 3/4.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam or very cobbly loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 22 percent.  Rock fragments range from 2 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 40 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 5YR 5/6, 6/4, 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 7.5YR 3/3 or 2.5YR 3/4.  Texture is gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, cobbly loam or very cobbly loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral."

These soils formed in alluvium weathered from predominantly volcanic rocks.  Elevation is 200 to 400 feet, (61 to 122 m).  Mean annual precipitation is 23 to 28 inches, (584 to 711 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F, (16 to 17 degrees C).  Frost-free season is 250 to 255 days."
