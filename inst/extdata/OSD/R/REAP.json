  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the A and AC horizons ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  These soils are calcareous throughout the matrix.   All horizons are clay or silty clay.  The average clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 45 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or brown (10YR 5/3).  The AC horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/4, 4/4), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).\nThe C horizon is brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 10YR 5/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4; 2.5Y 6/4), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  Intersecting slickensides are distinct beginning at depths of 24 to 36 inches below the soil surface.  The accumulation of calcium carbonate ranges from a few concretions and soft bodies to 15 percent by volume."

Ferris, Heiden, and Randall soils are moist for longer periods; in addition, Heiden and Randall soils have moist color values of less than 3.5 throughout the upper 12 inches in more than half the pedon.  Harlingen soils have more than 60 percent clay and average soil temperatures are 72 degrees F., or greater.  Lipan, Randall, and Roscoe soils have chromas of less than 1.5 throughout the upper 12 inches in more than half the pedon.  Leeray, Indiahoma, Stamford, and Tobosa soils have moist values of less than 3.5 throughout the upper 12 inches in more than half the pedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reap soils are in wide valleys.  Slopes are dominantly less than 2 percent, but range up to 3  percent.  Reap soils occur in the high position in either ridgeswale or microknoll-microdepression gilgai relief; generally in a complex with Tobosa or Randall soils which are in the microlows.  The pattern of occurence is cyclic, but the cyclic dimensions are larger than the limits of a pedon.  These soils formed in brownish calcareous clay that is apparently ancient alluvium several feet thick.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 32 to 44."
