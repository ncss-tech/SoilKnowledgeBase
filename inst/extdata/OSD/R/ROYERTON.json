  "OVERVIEW": "The Royerton series consists of moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy outwash and glacial till on till plains and moraines.  They are very deep soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense glacial till.  They are moderately or moderately slowly permeable in the solum and very slowly permeable in the underlying dense till.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
