  "OVERVIEW": "The Reston series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from greenstone.  Reston soils are on narrow, rounded ridgetops and convex sideslopes and have slopes ranging from 3 to 75 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and mean annual preicipitation is about 45 inches.",

Depth to hard bedrock is 5 to 10 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or gravelly loam, averaging 18 to 27 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent gravel."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metavolcanic greenstone.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and dry warm summers.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F., and the annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Pengra soils are fine-loamy over clayey, are more than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are somewhat poorly drained.
