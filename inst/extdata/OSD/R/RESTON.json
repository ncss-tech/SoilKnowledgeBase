The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metavolcanic greenstone.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and dry warm summers.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F., and the annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."
