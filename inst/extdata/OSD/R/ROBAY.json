  "REVDATE": "09/2004",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Robay series consists of very shallow to shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits, alluvium and local residuum derived from Navajo sandstone. Robay soils are on structural benches. Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
