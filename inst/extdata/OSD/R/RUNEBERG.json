  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 17 to 36 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise 3 to 15 percent of the volume of the series control section and C horizon but in  some pedons rock coarse fragment range to 20 percent in the C horizon.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches in thickness.  The series control section averages between 8 to 18 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent sand.   Some pedons have an 0 horizon less than 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2 or N2/0 or N3/0.  It has redoximorphic features in some pedons.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or its mucky modifier.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have chroma of 3 in the lower part.  It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features in all parts.  It is sandy loam, or loam.  It is slightly acid or slightly alkaline.  A BC horizon is in some pedons.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  It has 6 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Runeberg soils have plane or concave slopes on toe slopes of drumlins, \"valleys\" between drumlins and on glacial moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in calcareous coarse-loamy glacial till of the Wadena Lobe of the late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 32 inches, and 32 to 36 inches for the high PPT phases MN0100 and MN0101 used in New York for MLRA 142.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.   Frost-free days range from 40 to 150 days.  Elevation ranges from 670 to 1600 feet above sea level, and from 200 to 800 feet for the high PPT and stony, high PPT phases."

The very poorly drained phase has an apparent water table at plus 1 to 0.5 feet from January to December in most years."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Type location was transferred to Todd County due to more knowledge in the area.  This was formerly classified as coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplaquolls.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (A horizon); cambic horizon - zone from 10 to 26 inches (Bg horizons); aquic subgroup - low chroma immediately below mollic epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MN Agr. Exp. Sta. Central File Code No. 410 for results of some laboratory analysis of a pedon of this series.  Soil Interpretation Record numbers are:  MN0293; MN0500, depressional; MN0614, acid substratum.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
