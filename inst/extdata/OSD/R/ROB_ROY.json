These soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 6 out of 10 years.  The soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nDepth to slightly weathered igneous bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 11 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  Color value darker than 5 dry and 3 moist extends to depths of less than 20 inches.  The Bt horizon is silty clay, clay loam or clay containing 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It has moderate medium or fine angular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam, cobbly clay loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium 20 to 40 inches deep over igneous and sedimentary bedrock.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., mean summer temperature is about 61 to 64 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 14 to 18 inches, but ranges to 12 inches in California.  The freeze-free period is 60 to 100 days."
