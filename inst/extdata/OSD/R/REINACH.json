  "STATES": "KS,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Reinach series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium mostly from red beds of Permian age.  These nearly level soils are on high flood plains predominantly in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 910 mm (36 in).",
