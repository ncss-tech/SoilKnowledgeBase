  "OVERVIEW": "The Ryus series consists of deep well drained upland soils.  They formed in loess that has been altered slightly by flooding.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 46 centimeters (18 inches), and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.) at the type location.",
