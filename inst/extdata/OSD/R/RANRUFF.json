  "OVERVIEW": "The Ranruff series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone.  Ranruff soils are on foothills.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
