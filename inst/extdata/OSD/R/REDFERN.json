  "OVERVIEW": "The Redfern series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from hard fine grained sandstone or fine grained igneous rock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges, divides and sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
