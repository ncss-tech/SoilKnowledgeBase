These soils are on nearly level to slightly undulating topography. Slope gradient is usually less than 1 percent but ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 155 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 156 to 285 meters (512 to 935 feet) above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Andres soils and moderately well drained Symerton soils form a hydro-sequence with the Reddick soils and are on higher landform positions. Elliott and Mokena soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly higher landform positions."

Where drained, an intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loamy material and moderately low or moderately high (0.14 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the till or lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and slow or very slow in the till or lacustrine sediments."
