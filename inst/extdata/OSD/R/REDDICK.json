  "OVERVIEW": "The Reddick series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loamy water-laid sediments over till or lacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches).",

Where drained, an intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loamy material and moderately low or moderately high (0.14 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the till or lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and slow or very slow in the till or lacustrine sediments."
