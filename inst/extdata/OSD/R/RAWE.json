    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rawe soils are on fan remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 1,730 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delp, Isolde, Pizene, and Sutcliff soils.  Delp soils are coarse-loamy, have an argillic horizon composed of lamellae, and occur on stable dunes. Isolde soils are sandy, have an ochric epipedon, and occur on stable dunes. Pizene soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons, and occur on adjacent fan remnants. Sutcliff soils are loamy-skeletal, deep to a duripan, and occur on adjacent fan remnants."
