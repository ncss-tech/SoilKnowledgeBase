When the A horizon is mixed to a depth of 7 inches, the soil is calcareous throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Kennewick soils have hard, firm, laminated silt loam above depth of 40 inches and typically have 2.5Y hue.  Linoyer soils lack visible secondary carbonates in the series control section.  Pomat and Wheeler soils lack Bk horizons.  Pocatello soils have A horizons less than 5 inches thick that have value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist and has none or slight effervescence in the A horizon and a Bw horizon that is slightly hard and friable."

They are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches.  The average January temperature is 28 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 71 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F.  The frost free season is 135 to 180 days."
