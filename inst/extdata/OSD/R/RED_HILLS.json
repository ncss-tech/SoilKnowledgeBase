    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft decalcified quartzose limestone and calcareous sandstone and shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to hard rock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments are gravel and channers of decalcified reddish quartzose limestone and calcareous sandstone and shale and range from 5 to 25 percent in the A horizon, from 15 to 35 percent in the upper part of the Bw horizon, and from 5 to 45 percent in the lower part of the Bw or BC horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or rarely clay loam and sandy clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon (and BC horizon if present) has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon is soft, reddish, decalcified quartzose limestone and calcareous sandstone and shale that may have seams of clayey material along relict fractures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Red Hills soils are on dominantly narrow sloping to steep ridge tops and steep and very steep side slopes.  The soil formed in colluvium and residuum from materials weathered from calcareous sandstone or quartzose limestone interbedded with sandy shale.  At least a portion of each profile formed in colluvium or material affected by soil creep.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 57.0 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 56.5 inches."

Neubert soils are on adjacent narrow floodplains and are very deep.  Steekee soils are on nearby side slopes and ridge tops and are in a shallow family.  Tellico soils are on adjacent gently sloping to very steep ridge tops and side slopes and are deep or very deep."
