  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 44 to 46 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 6 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick.  Depth to sandy textures is 28 to more than 60 inches.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The lower part is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has moderate to weak granular or blocky structure.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon.  It has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and is 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It commonly has mottles that have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 4 or 6 moist. The C horizon commonly is stratified.  It ranges from silt loam to sand and may be gravelly.  It is 0 to 20 percent gravel.  Some pedons have a thin layer of volcanic ash that commonly is in the upper part of the C horizon.  Thin irregular wavy bands with 18 to 27 percent clay are present in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon is coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand.  This horizon is below 60 inches in some pedons."

Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
