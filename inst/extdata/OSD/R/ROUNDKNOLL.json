  "OVERVIEW": "The Roundknoll series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra. Roundknoll soils are on kipukas on recent basalt plains and associated with lava flows.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The permeability is rapid. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
