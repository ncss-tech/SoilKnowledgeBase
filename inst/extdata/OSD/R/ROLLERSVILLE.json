Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy material moderately low in the lower part of the solum formed in till, and low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the sandy material, moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the solum formed in till, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Rollersville soils have been converted from Muck map units during the modernization project in Wood County, Ohio. These soils originally had a histic epipedon that was later depleted due to oxidation, wind erosion, and subsequent incorporation with mineral material.\nParticle-size class has been changed with the revision (10/2003) from coarse-loamy to sandy over loamy based on lab data for pedon WD-134. The cation-exchange activity class was also changed from superactive to active to reflect the loamy portion of the control section. Also, Great Group was changed from Epiaquolls to Endoaquolls based on landform position.\nRepresentative data mapunit is DMU ID 155111 in MO 11.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 132 cm (Bg, 2BC horizon).\nDensic contact: at 132 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features present in all horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data for the typical pedon (WD-134) is available at The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
