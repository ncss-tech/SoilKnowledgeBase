  "OVERVIEW": "The Riverton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly sediments.  These soils are on uplands or high terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1140 mm (45 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
