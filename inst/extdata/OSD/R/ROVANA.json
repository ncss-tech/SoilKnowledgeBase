  "OVERVIEW": "The Rovana series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in granitic alluvium with a component of volcanic ash.  Rovana soils are on alluvial fans, fan terraces, and valley floors and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C from about April 15 to December 20 and above 8.3 degrees C from about April 15 to November 30.  The mean annual soil temperature is 12.8 to 15 degrees C.  In some areas the soil contains up to 25 percent rhyolitic volcanic ash by weight.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Textures are loamy sand or gravelly loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.   The organic carbon content is 0.35 to 0.60 percent.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 5/4 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/2.  Textures are stratified loamy coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand and gravelly loamy coarse sand, with some thin very gravelly lenses present.  In some pedons the lower C horizon is very cobbly loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 50 percent (averaging 5 to 35 percent between 25 and 102 cm depth) with 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."
