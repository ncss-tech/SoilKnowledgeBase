    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between depths of 25 to 102 cm is usually dry from about May 15 to November 15, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C from about April 15 to December 20 and above 8.3 degrees C from about April 15 to November 30.  The mean annual soil temperature is 12.8 to 15 degrees C.  In some areas the soil contains up to 25 percent rhyolitic volcanic ash by weight.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Textures are loamy sand or gravelly loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.   The organic carbon content is 0.35 to 0.60 percent.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 5/4 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/2.  Textures are stratified loamy coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand and gravelly loamy coarse sand, with some thin very gravelly lenses present.  In some pedons the lower C horizon is very cobbly loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 50 percent (averaging 5 to 35 percent between 25 and 102 cm depth) with 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."

In some areas, a moderate amount of rhyolitic volcanic ash is present in the soil.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The elevation ranges from 1,375 to 1,895 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 300 mm; aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.  The mean January temperature is about 1.1 degrees C; the mean July temperature is about 22.2 degrees C.  The mean annual temperature is 8.3 to 13.9 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."
