These soils are usually moist, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to dense till is 20 to 40 inches.  There is a perched water table above the dense fill substratum for over 30 cumulative days (Oxyaquic).  The solum has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc and an acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1 to 3 percent.  The particle-size control section has 40 to 80 percent rock fragments by volume.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 35 to 50 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  It has 2 to 6 percent organic matter.  It has 10 to 25 percent clay.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR moist and dry, value of 5 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.
