  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redtom series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from arkosic rock. Redtom soils are on hills, ridges, valley sides, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
