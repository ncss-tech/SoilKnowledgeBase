  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The soil was formerly included in the Litle series.  Litle soils have a soil moisture control section that is dry for longer periods of time and occur in an aridic moisture regime. Evaluation of laboratory data and field data supports the classification of Aridic Haplusterts.  Calcium carbonate in the solum decreases with depth and is considered primary, not secondary.  Gypsum in the BCk/Cr is primary to the shale parent paterial.  Smectitic mineralogy based on field observations during September, 2002 Progress Field Review.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section: 10 to 36 inches.\nParticle-size control section: 10 to 36 inches.  (lower part of the Bss1 and the Bss2, BCk and BCk/Cr horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 3 to 29 inches.  (Bss1 and Bss2 horizons)\nParalithic contact: Shale bedrock at 36 inches.  (Cr horizon)\nVertic features: The presence of wedge shaped aggregates and slikensides from 3 to 29 inches (Bss1, Bss2, and BCk horizons)\nOther features: Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition, 1999\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory sample S93CO-071-011 sampled as Razor, revised to Ritoazul.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
