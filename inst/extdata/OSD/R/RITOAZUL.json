  "OVERVIEW": "The Ritoazul series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale.  Ritoazul soils are on hills, pediments, fans, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The soil was formerly included in the Litle series.  Litle soils have a soil moisture control section that is dry for longer periods of time and occur in an aridic moisture regime. Evaluation of laboratory data and field data supports the classification of Aridic Haplusterts.  Calcium carbonate in the solum decreases with depth and is considered primary, not secondary.  Gypsum in the BCk/Cr is primary to the shale parent paterial.  Smectitic mineralogy based on field observations during September, 2002 Progress Field Review.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section: 10 to 36 inches.\nParticle-size control section: 10 to 36 inches.  (lower part of the Bss1 and the Bss2, BCk and BCk/Cr horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 3 to 29 inches.  (Bss1 and Bss2 horizons)\nParalithic contact: Shale bedrock at 36 inches.  (Cr horizon)\nVertic features: The presence of wedge shaped aggregates and slikensides from 3 to 29 inches (Bss1, Bss2, and BCk horizons)\nOther features: Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition, 1999"
