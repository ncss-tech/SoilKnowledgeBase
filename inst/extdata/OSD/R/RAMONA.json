  "OVERVIEW": "The Ramona series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, thermic family of Typic Haploxeralfs.  Typically, Ramona soils have brown, slightly and medium acid, sandy loam and fine sandy loam A horizons, reddish brown and yellowish red, slightly acid, sandy clay loam B2t horizons, and strong brown, neutral, fine sandy loam C horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. or is below 47 degrees F. for only a few days in January.  Soil between the depth of about 5 and 15 inches usually is moist in some or all parts from November or early December until late April or May and is dry all the rest of the year.  The A and B horizons have more than 15 percent combined coarse and very coarse sand and 5 to 35 percent fine rock fragments of 2 to 5mm size.  Rock fragments larger than 5mm are less than 5 percent.  The C horizons are variable as to coarse sand, fine gravel, and rock fragments larger than 5mm but in general are more coarse than the A and B horizons.\nThe A horizon is light brownish gray to dark grayish brown or yellowish brown (10YR 6/2, 5/2, 4/2, 6/3, 5/3, 4/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4) when dry.  It is course sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or light loam and has less than 1 percent organic matter.  After considerable cultivation or cattle trampling some or all of the A horizon is hard or very hard and massive when dry.  It is neutral to moderately acid.  The lower boundary is gradual or there is an A3 horizon or a B1 horizon or both horizons are present.\nThe B2t horizon is dark brown, strong brown, brown or light brown in 7.5YR hue or reddish brown or yellowish red in 5YR hue in yellowish in 10YR hue in the lower part.  It is heavy sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  Total clay content is 3 to 12 percent more in the B2t horizon than in the A horizon.  The B2t horizon is slightly acid or neutral in all parts or in some pedons it is slightly alkaline in the lower part.  It has weak or moderate angular blocky or prismatic structure.  In pedons having a B3 or B3t horizon, color of the transitional horizon is similar to the B2t horizon or it has a hue 1/4 letter interval less red.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is neutral to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons it is calcareous in some part with a small amount of segregated or disseminated lime."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arbuckle, Blasingame, Borden, Esparto, Fallbrook, Montpellier, Sesame, Snalling, Tivy, Wasioja, and Wyman series.  Arbuckle soils are gravelly with more than 15 percent gravel larger than 5mm in the argillic horizon.  Blasingame and Tivy soils have a paralithic contact less than 40 inches below the surface.  Borden soils have an argillic horizon that is moderately alkaline and is calcareous in some or all parts.  Esparto soils are marginal to the silty family with less than 20 percent fine gravel, coarse and very coarse sand.  Fallbrook soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  The difference in total clay content between A and B2t horizon is more than 10 percent absolute.  Sesame soils have a lithic contact between A and B2t horizon is more than 10 percent absolute.  Sesame soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Snalling soils are medium acid in the B2t horizon.  (See Remarks).  Wasioja soils have an aridic moisture regime marginal to xeric.  Wyman soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand, less than 10 percent absolute clay difference between A and B horizon and about 27 to 35 percent clay in the B2t horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ramona soils are nearly level to moderately steep.  They are on terraces and fans at elevations of 250 to 3,500 feet.  They formed in alluvium derived mostly from granitic and related rock sources.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches.  Average January temperature is 50 degrees F., average July temperature is about 70 degrees F., average annual temperature is 60 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 230 to 320 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Ramona soils are formerly classified as Noncalcic Brown soils.  The Snalling soils are differentiated from Ramona soils on soil reaction in the B2t horizon.  Some differentiae used to separate series within this family are difficult to apply consistently.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 10/72.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
