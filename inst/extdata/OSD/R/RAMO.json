  "OVERVIEW": "The Ramo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed loess and alluvium with some colluvial influence over clayey material weathered from basalt and tuff. Ramo soils are on concave foot slopes. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer and early fall months. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. A stone line is between the surface horizons and the buried soils in some pedons. The soil reaction throughout the solum is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. The rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Percentage of surface covered with stones ranges from 0 to about 3.\nThe BA horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay. It has 10 to 35 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones of both hard basalt and soft tuff materials.\nThe 2C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 5 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam or clay loam with 0 to 10 percent stones, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel."

Cranegulch soils do not have a buried genetic horizon (2Btb) and the pscs has 15 to 25 percent medium and coarser sand.  Daphnedale soils are 25 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Keating soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Macool soils are 40 to 50 inches to a paralithic contact (diorite) and have a MAST of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Maple Hollow soils have secondary carbonates (Bk) below depths of 36 inches and a pscs with 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  Midvale soils have a thin discontinuous silica-iron duripan between 20 and 40 inches. Rocha soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact (shale) and have a MAST of 54 to 58 degrees F.  Widmer soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact (weathered vesicular basalt)"
