  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is typically 7 to 9 inches thick but ranges from 7 to 19 inches.  Depth to bedrock and a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  These soils are typically free of carbonates through the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Rock fragments are typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay or heavy clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay with more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay or heavy clay loam.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 4 to 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  A C horizon is present in some pedons."

Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 4,000 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is cool and semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches of which about half falls from April through July.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days."
