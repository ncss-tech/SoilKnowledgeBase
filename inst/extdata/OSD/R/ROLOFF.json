  "OVERVIEW": "The Roloff series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and glaciofluvial deposits over basalt.  Roloff soils are on ridgetops, benches, hillslopes and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 to 24 inches, or the surface of the bedrock if shallower.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 25 percent coarse fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2, 3, or 4 dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.   Reaction is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam, gravelly silt loam, very fine sandy loam or gravelly loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

All of these soils except Caphealy and Roosevelt lack bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Caphealy soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and have 10 to 25 percent pumice sand throughout the profile.  Roosevelt soils have a Bw horizon that is sandy loam or fine sandy loam."

The soils formed in loess and glaciofluvial deposits over basalt.  They are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  The average January temperature is 29 degrees F.  The average July temperature is 71 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 135 to 185 days."
