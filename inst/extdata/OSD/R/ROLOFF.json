  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 to 24 inches, or the surface of the bedrock if shallower.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 25 percent coarse fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2, 3, or 4 dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.   Reaction is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam, gravelly silt loam, very fine sandy loam or gravelly loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burch, Calpine, Caphealy, Cashmere, Cashmont, Rio King, Roosevelt, Sevenmile, Shantown, Snake Hollow, and Surprise series.  All of these soils except Caphealy and Roosevelt lack bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Caphealy soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and have 10 to 25 percent pumice sand throughout the profile.  Roosevelt soils have a Bw horizon that is sandy loam or fine sandy loam."

The soils formed in loess and glaciofluvial deposits over basalt.  They are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  The average January temperature is 29 degrees F.  The average July temperature is 71 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 135 to 185 days."
