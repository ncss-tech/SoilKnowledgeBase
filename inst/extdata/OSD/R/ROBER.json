  "OVERVIEW": "The Rober series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial lacustrine sediments containing volcanic ash.  Rober soils are on mountain sides and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent and elevations from 800 to 2,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
