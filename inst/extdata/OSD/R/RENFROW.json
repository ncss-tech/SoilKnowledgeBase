  "OVERVIEW": "The Renfrow series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in material weathered from clayey shale of Permian age.  These soils are on summits and backslopes of low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 810 mm (32 in) and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
