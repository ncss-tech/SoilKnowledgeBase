  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ramper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Ramper soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains, and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
