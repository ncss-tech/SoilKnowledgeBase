  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the Bw, BC, and C horizons. Buried A and/or B horizons, present in some pedons below a depth of 25 inches, have the same range in color and texture as the A or B horizons. Content of mica flakes ranges from none to common throughout the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 2 are less than 7 inches thick. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons have a subhorizon of the Bw with hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Iron concentrations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common. At depths of 24 inches or more, iron depletions of chroma 2 or less range from none to common. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Iron concentrations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common. At depths of 24 inches or more, iron depletions of chroma 2 or less range from none to common. Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8. Iron concentrations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common. Iron depletions in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from none to common. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand. Strata of finer or coarser textured material are present in most pedons. Flakes of mica range from few to common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Starr is the only known series in the same family. Other competing series in closely related families include the Congaree and Shellbluff series. Starr soils typically have Bw horizons with hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout. Congaree soils do not have a cambic horizon. Shellbluff soils have a fine-silty particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in loamy alluvium. The average annual air temperature ranges from 61 to 68 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Buncombe soils are on slightly higher parts of natural levees and are coarse-loamy. State and Wickham soils are on adjacent low terraces and have argillic horizons. The somewhat poorly drained Chewacla and the poorly drained Wehadkee soils are in slightly lower positions."
