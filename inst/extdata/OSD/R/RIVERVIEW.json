  "OVERVIEW": "The Riverview series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 66 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 58 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the Bw, BC, and C horizons. Buried A and/or B horizons, present in some pedons below a depth of 25 inches, have the same range in color and texture as the A or B horizons. Content of mica flakes ranges from none to common throughout the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 2 are less than 7 inches thick. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons have a subhorizon of the Bw with hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Iron concentrations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common. At depths of 24 inches or more, iron depletions of chroma 2 or less range from none to common. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Iron concentrations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common. At depths of 24 inches or more, iron depletions of chroma 2 or less range from none to common. Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8. Iron concentrations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common. Iron depletions in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from none to common. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand. Strata of finer or coarser textured material are present in most pedons. Flakes of mica range from few to common."
