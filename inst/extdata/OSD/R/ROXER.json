The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice. The upper 7 to 12 inches has an estimated volcanic glass content of more than 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus  iron of 1.o to 2.0 percent, 15-bar moisture content of 10 to 12 percent, and moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 g/cc. The exchange complex of the particle-size control section is assumed to be dominated by amorphous material.  The pscs has 7 to 10 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It averages 15 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It averages 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bw1 horizon has  hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry or moist. Texture is a very gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam. It averages 20 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has  hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6 dry or moist. Texture is a very cobbly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam. It averages 20 to 30 percent gravel and 15 to 25 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Texture is very cobbly loam or very gravelly loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roxer soils are on mountain side slopes and toeslopes of glacial valleys.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The soils formed in colluvium derived from Teanaway basalt and glacial drift with an admixture of volcanic ash. Elevation is 2,000 to 5,800 feet. These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 65 inches. The mean January temperature is about 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. The mean annual growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 170 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nCchric epipedon - the zone from 1 to 8 inches Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 60 inches.\nAndic soil properties - the zone from 1 to 8 inches\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 41 inches\nNote: Further investigation is needed regarding the identification of a dominance of amorphous material throughout the pscs.  The andic subgroup is supported by the mantle of volcanic ash as described in the setting however, the weakly smeary consistency and statement of a dominance of amorphous material throughout the pscs indicates a potential for an Andisol.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
