  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to hard sandstone ranges from about 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments of sandstone range in size from pebbles to flagstones and are on the surface and mixed throughout the C horizon.   Rock fragments make up 35 to 60 percent by volume of the soil.  The soil averages between 10 and 20 percent clay.  The soil typically is calcareous to the surface, but some pedons are free of carbonates in the upper 5 inches.  Some pedons have 1 to 2 inches of mixed forest and grass litter on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is gravelly very fine sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam but is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam in some pedons.  It contains 15 to 25 percent pebbles by volume. It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nIn some pedons there is a thin AC horizon 1 to 3 inches thick, but it is not continuous.  It has color intermediate between the A and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam but is sandy loam or loam in some pedons and contains 35 to 60 percent fragments of rock by volume.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe R horizon is hard sandstone or siltstone that has numerous cracks in the upper part.  It typically lacks free carbonates, but individual fragments are coated or impregnated with carbonates depending on the layer encountered."

Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from sandstone or siltstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches."

Amor, Reeder, and Werner soils have mollic epipedons and are on less sloping landscapes.  In addition, the Amor and Reeder soils have a fine-loamy control section and are moderately deep to soft sandstone.  Blackhall, Cabba, Cabbart, and Cohagen are on lower nearby landscapes and have soft sandstone and siltstone bedrock at shallow depths.  Lakoa soils have an E horizon and argillic horizon and are on side slopes of lower landscapes.  Slimbutte soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower landscapes.  Vanocker soils are intermingled with Reva soils on plane slopes and have an argillic horizon and do not have bedrock at depths above 40 inches.  Watrous soils are on nearby flats and gently sloping landscapes and have a mollic epipedon, an argillic horizon, and are moderately deep to hard sandstone."
