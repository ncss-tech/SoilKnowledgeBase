  "OVERVIEW": "The Ralore series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
