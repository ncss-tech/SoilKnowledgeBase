  "OVERVIEW": "The Rebel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Rebel soils are on inset fans, fan remnants, fan skirts, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
