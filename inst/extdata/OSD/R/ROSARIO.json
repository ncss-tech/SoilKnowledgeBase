  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to highly fractured serpentinite bedrock ranges from 20 to 45 inches.  Depth to consolidated serpentinite bedrock ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Reaction range from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and upper Bo horizons and from slightly acid to neutral in the lower Bo horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of iron concretions is less than 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bo horizons have hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Content of iron concretions is less than 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4. Content of ironstone concretions is less than 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Content of paragravels is less than 15 percent, by volume. Texture is clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of very weakly to moderately cemented, highly weathered, fractured serpentinite.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R horizon is strongly cemented to indurated unweathered serpentinite bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rosario soils are on shoulders and side slopes of stable ridges of the serpentinite hills and mountains of southern Puerto Rico. Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  They formed in material that weathered from serpentinite bedrock.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 73 to 77 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 73 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification is currently updated to Inceptic Hapludox since there is a paralithic contact above the lithic contact.  The classification was recently updated with the 10/02 draft from Fine, ferruginous, isohyperthermic Lithic Hapludox to Clayey, ferruginous, isohyperthermic, shallow Typic Hapludox.  The previous update was 4/91.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nOxic horizon -the zone from 6 to 32 inches (Bo horizons).\nParalithic contact - the contact at 32 inches (Cr horizon).\nLithic contact - the contact at 44 inches (R horizon).\nThe type location was moved to its present location in 2002 and the series reclassified based on soil lab data and observations in the field.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization pedons - S01PR125007R and S02PR125006R.  San German Municipality, Puerto Rico.  Samples are by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE., 05/01 and 07/02.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
