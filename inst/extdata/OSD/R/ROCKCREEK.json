  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and till derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks. The Rockcreek soils are on seeps of mountain slopes and glacial canyon walls of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
