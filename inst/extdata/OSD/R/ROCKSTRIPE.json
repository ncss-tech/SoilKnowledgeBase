  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockstripe series consists of very shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum from volcanic mudflow breccia.  Rockstripe soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on Cascade foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, (889 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F, (15 degrees C).",
