  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosendale series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum from shale with or without a thin mantle of loess or thin layer of interbedded limestone, calcareous shale is at depths between 100 and 150 centimeters. These soils are on side slopes and ridges on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",
