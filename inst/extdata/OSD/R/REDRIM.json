  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redrim series consists of excessively drained soils which are shallow to sandstone.  They formed in sandy-skeletal beach deposits or residuum from sandstone or both.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy-skeletal deposits and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Thickness of the sandy-skeletal mantle and depth to a lithic contact with sandstone bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Typically, rock fragments are mostly rounded sandstone fragments but in some pedons, they are mostly angular sandstone fragments.  Some rounded igneous and metamorphic gravel and cobbles are present in most pedons.  Volume of rock fragments averages 35 to 90 percent in the family control section.  Volume of gravel or channers ranges from 5 to 50 percent.  Volume of cobbles or flags ranges from 10 to 40 percent.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, throughout.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral, value is 2 or 3, and chroma is 0 to 2.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically the gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogs of sand or loamy sand but in some pedons it is the channery, very channery, flaggy, or very flaggy analogs of sand or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is like those for the A horizon described above.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  (Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.)  Texture is like the A horizon described above.\nThe 2R horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value of 4 or 5."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1000 feet."

Abbaye soils have a loamy mantle 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone.  Brownstone soils have a sandy-skeletal mantle 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone.  Deerton soils have a sandy mantle 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone. Lapoin soils have a loamy and clayey mantle 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone.  Rock outcrops and bedrock escarpments are also commonly associated with Redrim soils."
