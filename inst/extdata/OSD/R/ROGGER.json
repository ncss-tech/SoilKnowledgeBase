  "OVERVIEW": "The Rogger series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum primarily from andesite, basalt and tuff.  Rogger soils are on plateaus and mountainsides with slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The base saturation by ammonium acetate is 50 to 75 percent throughout the solum.  The base saturation by sum of cations is 35 to 50 percent throughout the solum.  Depth to paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 when moist and 3 or 4 when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and 3 or 4 when dry.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 when moist and 4 when dry.  It is loam or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments average from 35 to 60 percent of which 10 to 30 percent are cobbles and stones, and 25 to 50 percent are gravel."
