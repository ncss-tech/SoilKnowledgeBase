These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from volcanic tuff and minor amounts of limestone. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,160 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, intermittently moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
