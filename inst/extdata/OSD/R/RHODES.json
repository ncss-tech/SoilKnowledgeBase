  "OVERVIEW": "The Rhodes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine silty alluvium deposits. These nearly level soils are on broad drainageways and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
