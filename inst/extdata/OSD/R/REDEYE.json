  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to a densic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates is 40 to 60 inches or more.  These soils typically have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part and 2 to 20 percent in the lower part.  Content of rock fragments is higher in thin stone lines.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand or fine sand.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have EB, E/B, B/E, or BE horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has value and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, or their gravelly and cobbly analogues.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  Some subhorizons are sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The particle size control section typically averages 6 to 14 percent clay but ranges from 5 to 18 percent and 65 to 75 percent sand.  It has common or many, faint or distinct, clay films on the faces of peds or in pores.  Some pedons have Fe depletions at depths greater than 10 inches below the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have 2BC horizons.  The bulk density of the 2Bt horizon ranges from 1.65 to 1.8 gm/cc.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 5.  It typically is sandy loam, loamy sand or their gravelly analogues. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have pockets or wedges of sandy or gravelly material in the 2B and 2C horizons.  The bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc.  It is considered to be a densic contact."

Akeley soils have 40 to 60 inches of outwash over glacial lacustrine deposits.  Andrusia soils have friable argillic horizons with bulk density less than 1.65 gm/cc and sandy C horizons.  Braham, Cutaway, and Leaflake soils have C horizons with bulk density less than 1.80 gm/cc.  Captom soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  DeMontreville, Escanaba, and Pomroy soils have hues 7.5YR or redder in the argillic horizons and substratums.  Haskill soils are underlain by sandy textures within a depth of 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Redeye soils are nearly level to strongly sloping and have plane or slightly convex slopes on glacial drumlins and moraines.  They formed in sandy outwash overlying dense sandy loam glacial till.  Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 172.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1600 feet."

Moderately well drained Huntersville soils are on concave and plane surfaces on lower lying landscapes. Very poorly drained and poorly drained Roscommon soils are in the depression and interdrumlin areas.  Excessively drained Menahga and Nymore soils are sandy throughout the profile and occupy similar positions.  Organic soils in depressions and interdrumlin areas are also associated in many places."
