Rock fragments of shale, siltstone, limestone, chert, geodes, and sandstone are mostly gravel or channer size.  They range from a trace to 30 percent in the solum and from a trace to 50 percent below the solum.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine-earth is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or rarely fine sandy loam.  Some wooded areas may have a thin A horizon with value or chroma of 2.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has a dominant hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have subhorizons with hue of 5YR.  Texture of the fine-earth is loam, silt loam,  silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or gray.  Texture of the fine-earth is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or rarely silty clay.\nSome pedons have a lithologic discontinuity below about 50 inches."
