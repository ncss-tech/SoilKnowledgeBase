  "OVERVIEW": "The Renox series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy colluvium or alluvium from interbedded siltstone, shale, limestone, and sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent.  Near the type location, average annual precipitation is 51 inches and  average annual temperature is 56 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of shale, siltstone, limestone, chert, geodes, and sandstone are mostly gravel or channer size.  They range from a trace to 30 percent in the solum and from a trace to 50 percent below the solum.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine-earth is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or rarely fine sandy loam.  Some wooded areas may have a thin A horizon with value or chroma of 2.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has a dominant hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have subhorizons with hue of 5YR.  Texture of the fine-earth is loam, silt loam,  silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or gray.  Texture of the fine-earth is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or rarely silty clay.\nSome pedons have a lithologic discontinuity below about 50 inches."
