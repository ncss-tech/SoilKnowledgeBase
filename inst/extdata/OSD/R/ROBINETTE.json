All of these soils except for the Gorman\nsoils have the argillic horizon occurring above 40 inches.\nThe Banning soils are dry for 45 to 60 days, have a mean\nannual soil temperature of 52 to 56 degrees F, and are\nsomewhat poorly drained.  The Coolbrith soils are somewhat\npoorly drained and over 60 inches deep to bedrock.  The\nDotta soils are over 60 inches deep to bedrock.  The Drews\nsoils are dry for 100 to 115 days and are over 60 inches\ndeep to bedrock.  The Gorman soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 57 degrees F, have 20 to 28 percent\nclay in the control section and contain 15 to 25 percent\ncoarse and very coarse sand throughout the profile.  The\nHarriman soils are dry for 80 to 120 days, have a paralithic\ncontact at 40 to 60 inches and have an influence of\ndiatomaceous earth.  The Supan series description needs\nupdating; the soils are assumed to have a mean annual\nsoil temperature above 52 degrees F.  The Van Dusen soils\nhave 25 percent or less coarse fragments in the argillic\nhorizon and are over 60 inches deep to bedrock.  The Waha\nsoils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  The\nWapinitia soils have a solum 20 to 36 inches thick."

It is found on patterned land locally referred to\nas biscuit-scabland.  Robinette is the biscuit.  The soils\nformed in colluvium from basalt with an influence of loess\nand volcanic ash in the upper horizons.  Winters are cold\nand moist, and summers are warm and dry.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual\ntemperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is\n100 to 120 days."
