  "REVDATE": "1/99",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  These soils are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
