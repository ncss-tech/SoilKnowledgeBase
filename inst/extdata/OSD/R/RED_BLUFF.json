Argillic horizon 20 to 72 inches has an average of 36 percent clay and the clay distribution does not decrease from its maximum amount by as much as 20 percent of that maximum throughout to a depth of 1.5 m from the soil surface or skeletons are present if decrease is greater than 20 percent.  The upper 20 inches average over 35 percent clay.\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 6/86."
