  "OVERVIEW": "The Rush series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The Rush soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on outwash plains, terraces, kames, and eskers. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
