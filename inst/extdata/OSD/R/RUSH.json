The well drained Fox and Ockley soils are on similar landform positions and have more sand in the upper part of the sola. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Mahalasville and Westland soils are in depressional areas and drainageways, have a mollic epipedon, and have more sand in the upper part of the sola. Mahalasville soils have gravelly substrata where they are mapped in association with the Rush soils. The somewhat poorly drained Waynetown soils are on slightly lower positions."
