    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The lower one third of the series control section is saturated for at least 30 consecutive days during April to July and other periods of high rainfall during 6 years out of 10.  Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 1 to 8 percent by volume throughout the profile.  The mollic epipedon is 9 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A horizon is loam or clay loam.  The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon as much as 3 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Clay films are few to common.  The Bt horizon commonly is clay loam or loam, but includes subhorizons of sandy clay loam. The B/A clay ratios range from 1.2 to 1.3.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bk and C horizons have a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  They are loam or clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 22 to 30 percent.  The sand content ranges from 30 to 45 percent.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 25 percent. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Atkinson, Calmar, Hitt, Plattville, Rockton, and Sibleyville soils have sola that is terminated by lithic or paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Burchard, Cokato, Cresco, Griswold, La Rose, Linkville, Moingona, Pana, Rotamer, Schoolcraft, Shelby and Winnebago soils do not have saturation in the lower third of the series control section for more than one month.  Joslin soils have a layer in the lower half of the series control section that has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and a clay content of greater than 35 percent.  Keosauqua and Wea soils have strata of sand and less than 20 percent clay in the lower third of the series control section.  Friesland soils have silt loam or silty clay loam textures within the series control section. Hochheim and Markesan soils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalents in the lower third of the series control section.  Jasper soils have more than 45 percent sand in the lower third of the series control section.    Durand soils have less than 20 percent clay in the upper third of the series control section.  Morrill and Ringwood soils have less than 35 percent sand in the upper third of the series control section.  Velma soils have strongly acid or very strongly acid reaction in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 32 inches.  Frost-free days range from 125 to 165 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."

The well drained Storden soils are calcareous throughout and are on shoulders and backslopes.  The moderately well drained Le Sueur soils are on sideslopes and are wetter.  The poorly drained Cordova soils are on nearly level positions.  The well drained Cokato soils are above Reedslake soils and are drier.  The poorly drained Hamel soils are on footslopes.  The very poorly drained Glencoe soils are in closed depressions."
