  "OVERVIEW": "The Raggulch series consists of shallow, well drained soils on dissected terraces.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from sedimentary rock, conglomerate, and granitic rock.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
