  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reluctan soils are on hills, plateaus, lava plains, and mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 2,440 meters.  In Oregon elevation ranges to as low as 1,220 meters.  At the lower elevations, these soils occur on north aspects.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
