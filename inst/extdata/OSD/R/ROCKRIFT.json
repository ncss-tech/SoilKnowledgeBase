  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockrift Series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in till and local colluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. These soils are on glaciated uplands at elevations above 1750 feet. Slope ranges from 15 through 70 percent. The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.",

Rock fragments range from 15 through 45 percent in the upper part of the mineral solum, and from 25 through 70 percent in the lower part of the solum and substratum, with greater than 35 percent weighted average between a depth of 10 and 40 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly sandstone with smaller amounts of shale and siltstone. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through very strongly acid throughout.\nThe O horizon, when present, has a hue of 5YR through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is a muck or mucky peat.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Most pedons have a thin organic surface layer.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5 YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is very weak through moderate, fine through coarse, subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue, value, and chroma similar to the B horizon. Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. Structure is weak, fine through coarse subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons have a 2Cr horizon above the bedrock that is deeper than 40 inches."

Knapp Creek soils are deep soils formed in sandstone conglomerate. Lagross soils formed in water-sorted parent material. Macomber soils are moderately deep over metamorphic bedrock. Mandy soils have bedrock between 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Franklinville series are similar soils in another family. They average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rockrift soils are strongly sloping to very steep soils that typically occur in headslopes of hollows and lower side slopes of ridges and valley sides. Slope ranges from 15 through 70 percent. They formed in till and local colluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Most areas have between .01 and 3 percent of the soil surface covered with sandstone boulders. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 through 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 through 46 inches, and the mean frost-free season ranges from 100 through 130 days. The elevation ranges from 1750 feet through 3000 feet above sea level."

The Mongaup and Vly soils are both moderately deep to bedrock. The Lewbath and Willdin soils are nearby associates that have fragipans."
