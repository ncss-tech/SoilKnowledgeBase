  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ribera series consists of moderately deep to sandstone bedrock, well drained soils that formed in mixed material deposited by wind and water on upland fans and valley fill side slopes. Slopes are 1 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
