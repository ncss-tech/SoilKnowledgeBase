  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruins series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from quartz, sandstone and arkose.  Ruins soils are on high fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
