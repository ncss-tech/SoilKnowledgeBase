  "OVERVIEW": "The Redchief series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till, glaciofuvial deposits, slope alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on till plains, outwash plains, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
