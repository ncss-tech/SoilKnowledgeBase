The poorly drained Bajura soils are on slightly lower positions, and have clayey control sections.  The somewhat poorly drained Coloso soils are on slightly lower positions, do not have a mollic epipedon, and have clayey control sections.  The well drained Dique soils are on similar positions, do not have a mollic epipedon, and are fine-loamy.  The well drained Toa soils are on slightly lower positions and have clayey control sections."
