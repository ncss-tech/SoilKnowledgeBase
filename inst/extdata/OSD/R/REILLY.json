  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. SRT; JLL; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Reilly series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on slightly higher natural levees along stream and river channels of floodplains of the Humid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in stratified alluvial deposits of mixed origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in medium to coarse textured alluvial stratified sediments with sand and gravels in dominant proportions.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation range from 43 to 72 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 74 to 79 degrees F."

The poorly drained Bajura soils are on slightly lower positions, and have clayey control sections.  The somewhat poorly drained Coloso soils are on slightly lower positions, do not have a mollic epipedon, and have clayey control sections.  The well drained Dique soils are on similar positions, do not have a mollic epipedon, and are fine-loamy.  The well drained Toa soils are on slightly lower positions and have clayey control sections."
