  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness typically is 40 to 55 inches, but it ranges to 70 inches in thickness. Reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the lower part. The depth to the top of the fragipan is greater than 20 inches. Sand content is less than 10 percent and rock fragment content is less than 1 percent in the series control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some undisturbed pedons have value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, but the horizon is less than 6 inches thick. The A horizons that have not been limed are generally strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is typically silty clay loam.  It generally has prismatic structure in the upper part and angular blocky structure in the lower part. Subangular blocky is not excluded.\nThe Btx horizon (fragipan) has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is firm or very firm when moist and hard and brittle or fragile when dry. It is silty clay loam or silt loam."

Haubstadt soils have loam fragipans formed in alluvium. Nabb and Shakamak soils have a series control section that extends to a depth of more than 70 inches. Pierpont soils are less acid than strongly acid in the lower part of the solum, typically have carbonates within a depth of 60 inches, and typically contain more rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Plumfield soils have a fragipan within a depth of 20 inches. Sciotoville soils have mica flakes throughout the profile and are stratified in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The Robbs soils formed in 4 feet or more of loess underlain, commonly, by sandstone bedrock. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Climate consists of hot summers and cold winters with mean annual temperature between 54 and 57 degrees F, and precipitation between 42 and 48 inches per year."
