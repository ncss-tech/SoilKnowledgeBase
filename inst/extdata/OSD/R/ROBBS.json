  "OVERVIEW": "Robbs soils consist of very deep soils that moderately deep to a fragipan.  They are on nearly level to gently sloping ridgetops in unglaciated areas. The Robbs soils formed in 4 feet or more of loess underlain commonly by sandstone bedrock. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches per year.",

Sand content is less than 10 percent and rock fragment content is less than 1 percent in the series control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some undisturbed pedons have value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, but the horizon is less than 6 inches thick. The A horizons that have not been limed are generally strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is typically silty clay loam.  It generally has prismatic structure in the upper part and angular blocky structure in the lower part. Subangular blocky is not excluded.\nThe Btx horizon (fragipan) has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is firm or very firm when moist and hard and brittle or fragile when dry. It is silty clay loam or silt loam."

Haubstadt soils have loam fragipans formed in alluvium. Nabb and Shakamak soils have a series control section that extends to a depth of more than 70 inches. Pierpont soils are less acid than strongly acid in the lower part of the solum, typically have carbonates within a depth of 60 inches, and typically contain more rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Plumfield soils have a fragipan within a depth of 20 inches. Sciotoville soils have mica flakes throughout the profile and are stratified in the lower part of the series control section."
