The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The upper 9 to 14 inches of the soils is more than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth fraction.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 15 percent clay and 40 to 55 percent sand and is 5 to 30 percent rounded and subrounded pebbles by volume.\nThe A1 horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nThe A2 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry.  It is a loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry.

The soils formed in glacial drift and old alluvium with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  Elevation is 1,900 to 2,400 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 44 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 135 to 170 days."
