  "OVERVIEW": "The Roslyn series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in glacial drift and old alluvium with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  Roslyn soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The upper 9 to 14 inches of the soils is more than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth fraction.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 15 percent clay and 40 to 55 percent sand and is 5 to 30 percent rounded and subrounded pebbles by volume.\nThe A1 horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nThe A2 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry.  It is a loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry.
