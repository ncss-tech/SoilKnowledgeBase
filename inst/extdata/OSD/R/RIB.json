  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 20 to 40 inches. The weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy lower subsoil (transition zone). Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash, but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the solum and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum. Depth to carbonates is 5 feet or more. Redoximorphic concentrations are throughout the solum below the A horizon. Redoximorphic depletions are 50 percent or more of the matrix or of coats on faces of peds immediately below the Ap horizon and within 20 inches of the surface. Saturation occurs within a depth of 1 foot for long periods in normal years.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2. It is silt loam or mucky silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bg transition horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam or sandy loam or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 3BC or 3BCg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 8; and chroma of 1 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C or 3Cg horizon has color like the 3BC horizon described above. It is typically stratified layers of coarse sand, sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly. Some pedons have strata of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs."
