  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments with or without a thin paleosol over limestone bedrock.  These soils are on plane and convex slopes on summits and shoulder slopes on uplands, high structural benches, strath terraces, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 800 centimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
