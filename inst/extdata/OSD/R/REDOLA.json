  "OVERVIEW": "The Redola series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium that derived from various rock sources, mainly limestone, sandstone, and quartzite on alluvial fans, flood plains, and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick and organic matter decreases irregularly or remains above 0.5 percent to a depth of 50 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F, and average summer temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F.  The soils are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous.  The 10 to 40 particle size control inch section is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam, averaging less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Below 49 inches textures range from sand to loam and may be gravelly.  Some mottling occurs below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.  Clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent.  Carbonate equivalent is 1 to 15 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is stratified loam and sandy loam and many have thin strata of clay loam.  Clay content averages 10 to 18 percent.  Rock fragment content average 0 to 15 percent.  Pockets of gravelly loamy sand are common.  Carbonate equivalent is 1 to 15 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The soils occur on nearly level to sloping alluvial fans, flood plains, stream terraces and are formed in mixed alluvium derived from a wide range of parent material, mainly limestone, sandstone, and quartzite.  The climate is dry or moist subhumid.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches.
