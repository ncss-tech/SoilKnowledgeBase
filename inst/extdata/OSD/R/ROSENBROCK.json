  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosenbrock series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on nearly level to very gently sloping, plane to slightly convex surfaces on low ridges.  These soils formed from clayey alluvium over loamy residuum derived from noncemented tuffaceous siltstone of the Catahoula formation.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and mean annual temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the Coy, Monteola, and Tordia series.  Classification changed to Typic Haplusterts 9/97.\nThe 2Cr layer was changed to a 2Cdk horizon during the correlation of McMullen County. This decision was supported by the observation that the weakly consolidated tuffaceous siltstone bedrock slaked in water, probably due to increased weathering and landscape position. Tuffaceous siltstone bedrock in areas higher in the landscape is less weathered, retain more rocklike structure, and do not slake in water.\nEdited 11/2013 (RFG-GWH): Chemical property ranges were added to the RIC; Competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections were updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 79 cm (0 to 31 in).  (A, Bw, and Bk1 horizons)\nCambic horizon: 20 to 109 cm (8 to 43 in). (Bw, Bkss1, and Bkss2 horizons)\nVertic feature: presence of cracks when dry are up to 3 cm (1 in) wide and extend to more than 51 cm (20 in) in depth and the presence of slickenslides at 46 to 109 cm (18-43 in). (Bkss1 and Bkss2 horizons)\nDensic contact: 157 cm (62 in). (top of 2Cdk horizon)\nDensic material: 157 to 203 cm (62 to 80 in). (2Cdk horizon)"
