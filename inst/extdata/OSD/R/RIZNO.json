Bigmon, Hideout, Skyvillage, Travessilla, and Travson soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower in the C horizon. Kenzo soils are inactive. Lazear soils have a hue of 7.5YR or yellower and more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cabulla soils (separation unclear) have mean annual soil temperature of 8.3 to 11.1 degrees and bedrock includes the Summerville, Moenkopie and Entrada formations. Redspear soils have the soil moisture control section affected by peak periods of precipitation in April, May and June. Rizozo soils have less than 25 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Zukan soils have horizons with secondary carbonate accumulations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rizno soils are on structural benches on cuestas, ledges, mesas, and ridges. Elevations range from 3,960 to 8,000 feet with slopes ranging from 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and eolian material derived from sandstone, siltstone or limestone. Some areas near Capitol Reef National Park are overlain by basalt cobbles and stones as volcanic bombs. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches. The wettest months are July, August, and September and the driest months are April, May, and June. The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days."
