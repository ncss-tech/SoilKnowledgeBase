  "OVERVIEW": "The Roseglen series consists of very deep, well or moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy glaciolacustrine sediments.  These soils are on glacial lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 15 inches.",

Bowery and Sheckle soils have no carbonates and are medium acid to neutral. Falkirk soils have gravelly or sandy 2C horizons and formed in glaciofluvial deposits over till.  Garlips soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section in July."

Makoti soils are slightly lower on the landscape and are fine-silty.  Max and Williams soils are on nearby glacial till plains and have a thinner mollic epipedon.  Parshall soils are on beach areas and are coarse-loamy.  Tansem soils are on slightly higher positions on the landscape and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick."
