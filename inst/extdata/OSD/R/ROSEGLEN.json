    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arnegard, Bowery, Falkirk, Garlips, Shawa and Sheckle series.  Arnegard and Shawa soils do not have a calcic horizon and formed in alluvium.  Bowery and Sheckle soils have no carbonates and are medium acid to neutral. Falkirk soils have gravelly or sandy 2C horizons and formed in glaciofluvial deposits over till.  Garlips soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section in July."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roseglen soils are on level to gently rolling glacial lake plains.  Slopes are plane or very slightly concave.  Slope gradients are commonly less than 2 percent, but range to 9 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous loamy glaciolacustrine sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lehr, Makoti, Max, Parshall, Tansem and Williams soils.  Lehr soils formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel glaciofluvial deposits.  They are on higher positions on rims of lake plains and have a thinner mollic epipedon.  Makoti soils are slightly lower on the landscape and are fine-silty.  Max and Williams soils are on nearby glacial till plains and have a thinner mollic epipedon.  Parshall soils are on beach areas and are coarse-loamy.  Tansem soils are on slightly higher positions on the landscape and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick."
