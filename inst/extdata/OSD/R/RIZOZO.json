  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rizozo series consists of soils that are very shallow or shallow to hard sandstone.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium, residuum and eolian sediments derived from siltstone or sandstone. These soils are on dipslopes of cuestas, scarps and mesas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
