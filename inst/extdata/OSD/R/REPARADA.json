    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the organic horizon ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The soils are saturated for 3 months or more.  The reaction of all horizons ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray (10YR 3/1; N3/), black (10YR 2/1; N/4), very dark brown (10YR 2/2) or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2).  Mottles range from few through common and are in reddish hues and high chromas.  Texture of A horizons is clay or silty clay.\nThe B horizon ranges from very dark gray (10HR 3/1; N 3/),through gray (10YR 6/1; N 6/), or the greenish and bluish hues of the gley chart.  Structure is weak subangular blocky or structureless.\nOrganic layers range from hemic to sapric."

All these soils lack buried organic layers except the Pinones soils which have strongly through extremely acid reaction in the\ncontrol section.  The Bajura and Santoni soils have COLE values of more than .09 and slickensides in the control section.  The Coloso and Corcega soils have subhorizons with colors of chroma 3 or more.  The Fortuna, Manuabo, and Perchas soils have acid reactions in the control sections.  Igualdad soils have sandy or sandy-skeletal lower control sections.  The Talante soils have coarse-loam over sandy and Vayas have fine textured control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Reparada soils occur on nearly level coastal lowlands with slope gradients of 0 to 2 percent.  The regolith is clayey sediments of mixed origin which overlie decomposed and partially decomposed organic materials.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  Average annual rainfall is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F."
