These soils formed in stratified mixed alluvium from shale, sandstone, limestone, pyroclastics and basalt.  These soils are at elevations ranging from 4,700 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with an average annual  precipitation ranging from 12 to 16 inches.  Precipitation comes as gentle rains and snow in the winter and as thunderstorms in July, August and September.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 56 degrees F.  The mean temperature in July is about 71 degrees F. and 31 degrees F.\nin December.  Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."

Partri soils have an argillic horizon and a calcic horizon and Pastura soils have an argillic horizon and a calcic horizon and Pastura soils have a petrocalcic horizon at a shallow depth.  Tours soils are fine-loamy and Navajo soils have intersecting slickensides."
