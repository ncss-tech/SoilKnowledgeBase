  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the surficial loamy sediments over the weathered sandstone typically is 24 to 30 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Solum thickness corresponds closely to sediment depth, but roots develop in the loamy fine sand materials below.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. The A horizon ranges from 12 to 20 inches in thickness.\nThe B horizon is loam or sandy loam. Hue is 2.5Y or 5Y, value is 4 or 5 and chroma is 2 to 4.\nThe 2C materials range from loamy fine sand to very fine sandy loam with 70 to 80 percent sand and 6 to 10 percent clay. The 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Coriff, Fieldon, and Lemond series. The Coriff, Fieldon, and Lemond soils have more sand and less clay in the upper part of the control section. In addition, Coriff soils have a loam or clay loam 2C horizon within depths of 40 inches, Lemond soils have more medium and coarse sand in the 2C horizon, and Fieldon soils have more stratified C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rocksan soils are on nearly level broad summits and on shoulders that are below steeper backslopes and slightly above incised drainageways. Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. Within a depth of 60 inches there are 3 kinds of parent materials. The upper one is Holocene loess and eolian sediments. The lower 2 were cretacious interbedded sedimentary rocks, sandstone, shale or limestone. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aureola, Jacwin sandstone substratum, and Norville soils. Aureola soils are on ridges and higher-lying flats. They formed in similar sediments overlying sandstone and form a hydrosequence with the Rocksan soils. Jacwin sandstone substratum and Norville soils occur on slightly higher broad summits. They are underlain with reddish clayey deposits."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Runoff is low. Permeability is moderate in the surficial mantle and rapid in the 2C horizon. It is slow in the underlying clay deposits."
