  "OVERVIEW": "The Rencot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum weathered from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on hills, strath terraces, mountains and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
