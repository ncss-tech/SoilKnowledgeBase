  "OVERVIEW": "The Roubaix series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Roubaix soils are on ridges, terraces and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Citadel and Tollflat soils are fine, contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section, and formed in material derived from sedimentary rocks.  They are on similar landforms on linear and concave surfaces.  Pactola soils are loamy-skeletal and formed in material derived primarily from schist.  They are on similar landforms.  Vanocker soils are loamy-skeletal and formed in colluvium and residuum derived from limestone.  They are on similar landform positions.  Virkula soils are fine-silty and contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  They are on similar landforms and are more commonly found on linear and concave surfaces."
