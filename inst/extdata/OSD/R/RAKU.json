  "OVERVIEW": "The Raku series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Raku soils are on plains, drainageways, depressions, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
