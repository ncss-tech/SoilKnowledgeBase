  "OVERVIEW": "The Ricert series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Ricert soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
