  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ripcon soils are on drainageways in mountains. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, quartzite and granitic rocks. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,850 to 2,450 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 450 mm. These soils receive additional run-on moisture making it wetter than the precipitation zone would indicate.   Mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
