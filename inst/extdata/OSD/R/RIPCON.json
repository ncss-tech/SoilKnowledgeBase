  "OVERVIEW": "The Ripcon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, quartzite and granitic rocks. Ripcon soils are on drainageways. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 375 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.",
