    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ruedloff soils are on hills, benches, and toe slopes and have slopes of 1 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in coarse textured alluvium, residuum, and eolian deposits derived from sandstone. Parent materials are associated with Wasatch Formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 11 inches and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year.  June and July are the months of lowest precipitation during the growing season.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 95 days.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 6,500 feet."

Hiatha soils are shallow to shale bedrock, are in a fine family, and are on hills.  Simanni soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are on the same topographic position."
