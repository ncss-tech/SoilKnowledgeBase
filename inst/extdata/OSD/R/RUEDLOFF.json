  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruedloff series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on hills, benches, and toe slopes.  They formed in alluvium, residuum, and eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees and the mean annual precipitation is 10 inches.",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 11 inches and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year.  June and July are the months of lowest precipitation during the growing season.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 95 days.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 6,500 feet."
