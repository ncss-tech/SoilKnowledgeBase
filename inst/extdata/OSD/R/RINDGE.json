  "OVERVIEW": "The Rindge series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in fresh water marshes, sloughs and drainage channels from mixed decomposed reeds, tules and alluvium.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 301 millimeters (15 inches) and the annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (58 degrees F).",

Joice soils have an electrical conductivity that ranges from 15 to 48 decisiemens per meter at 25 degrees C. Longshoal soils are strongly saline and electrical conductivity is more than 16 decisiemens per meter and the Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) is more than 13."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rindge soils are in fresh water marshes, sloughs, river channels and deltas.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed from hydrophytic plant remains and mixed mineral alluvium.  The organic part is from reeds and tules and the mineral part is clayey.  Elevations are 1.5 meters (5 feet above) to 6 meters (20 feet) below sea level.  When below sea level, commonly they are islands protected by levees.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 305 to 508 millimeters (12 to 20 inches).  Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F); the mean July temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F); the mean annual temperature is about 14 to 16 degrees C (57 to 60 degrees F).  Frost-free season ranges from 250 to 310 days."

Peltier and Ryde are mineral soils with 10 to 30 percent organic matter in the control section.  Gazwell soils are mineral soils with buried organic layers below 71 to 99 centimeters (28 to 39 inches).  Webile soils are organic and have continuous fine textured mineral soils at depths of 91 to 130 centimeters (36 to 51 inches).  Kingile soils have continuous clayey mineral layers between depths of 41 to 91 centimeters (16 and 36 inches). Venice soils have a fiber content after rubbing of one sixth (16 percent) or more of the soil volume."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very slow runoff; rapid permeability.  In the Delta area, the water table is lowered by artificial drainage with open drains and pumps.  The water is usually at a depth of 91 centimeters (36 inches) during the growing season and at or near the surface at some time during the winter.  Areas along the coast are not drained and the water table is near the surface at all times."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The Rindge soils are used for cropland to grow such crops as asparagus, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, wheat and barley.  In some harvested areas, inundated fields are used for waterfowl hunting.  Near the coast the soil is idle or used for pasture."
