  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ramires soils are on hill and mountain side slopes and fan piedmont remnants with a rock core.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from tuff, rhyolite, and andesite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
