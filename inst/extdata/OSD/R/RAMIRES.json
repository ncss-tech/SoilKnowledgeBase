  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ramires series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, andesite and rhyolite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Ramires soils are on hill and mountain side slopes and fan piedmonts with a rock core.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
