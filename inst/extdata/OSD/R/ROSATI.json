  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosati series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands. They formed in loess and the underlying pedisediment and residuum. Permeability is moderately slow above the fragipan and very slow through the fragipan. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",
