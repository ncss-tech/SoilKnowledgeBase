The mean annual soil temperature\nis 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is typically\ngreater than 60 inches but may be 40 to 60 inches in some\npedons.  Depth to the 2Bt is 20 to 40 inches.

There is an absolute increase in clay of 15 to 30\npercent between the Bw and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It has 3 to 5 percent\norganic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty\nclay loam.  It has 20 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay.\nIt has 50 to 60 percent clay.\nThe 3Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4\nmoist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.

The soil is formed in colluvium and residuum\nderived dominantly from greenstone with an influence of\nloess and volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is\ncharacterized by cold moist winters and warm dry summers.\nThe mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean\nannual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free\nperiod is 100 to 130 days."
