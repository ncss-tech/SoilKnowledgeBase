  "OVERVIEW": "The Ridley series consists of deep, well drained soils that\nformed in colluvium from greenstone, with an influence of\nloess and volcanic ash in the surface.  Ridley soils are in\nconcave areas on hills and have slopes of 2 to 12 percent.\nThe mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the\nmean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
