  "OVERVIEW": "The Redcone Series consists of moderately deep to a weakly or moderately cemented duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic ash and cinders.  Redcone soils are on cinder cones and have slopes of 30 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Andic soil properties are present throughout a thickness of 30 to 50 inches and have 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass in the sand and coarse silt size fractions, 1.0 to 2.5 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 50 to 85 percent phosphate retention, and 3 to 12 percent 15-bar air-dry moisture content and 4 to 13 percent moist 15 bar water content.  The weighted average 8xSi+2xFe is 5 to 8.  The particle size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, dominantly cinders.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent andesite gravel, 10 to 30 percent cinder gravel, and 0 to 5 percent cinder cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  The upper part is ashy sandy loam or ashy loamy sand and the lower part is ashy loamy sand or ashy sand.  It contains 0 to 5 percent andesite gravel, 25 to 55 percent cinder gravel, and 0 to 5 percent cinder cobbles.\nThe 2Bqsm horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 through 5 moist and dry, and chroma of 0, 1, 4, 6, or 8 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sand and is weakly to moderately cemented.  It contains 15 to 35 percent cinder gravel.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 through 5 moist and dry, and chroma of 0, 1, 4, 6, or 8 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sand and it contains 65 to 90 percent cinder gravel."

The soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic ash and cinders from Mt. Mazama.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F and the frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."
