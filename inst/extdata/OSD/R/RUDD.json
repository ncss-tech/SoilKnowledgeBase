  "OVERVIEW": "The Rudd series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from basalt.  Rudd soils are on basalt mesas and lava flows and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
