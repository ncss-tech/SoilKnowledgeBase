Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.\nDepth to a calcic horizon: 3 to 15 inches\nDepth to petrocalcic horizon:  40 to 60 inches\nClay content (particle-size control section):  less than 18 percent\nA and AB horizons\nHue:  5YR, 7.5YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 3.5 through 5 moist\nChroma:  2 through 6, dry or moist\nTexture:  loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam\nCoarse fragments:  less than 5 percent gravel\nBt horizon\nHue:  2.5YR through 10YR\nValue:  5 through 7 dry, 3.5 through 5 moist; nodules and masses with high calcium carbonate content are 7 through 9 dry, 5 through 7 moist\nChroma:  3 through 6, dry or moist; nodules and masses with high calcium carbonate content have chroma of 2 through 4, dry or moist\nTexture:  sandy loam, calcium carbonate nodules have sandy clay loam texture in some pedons\nCoarse fragments:  less than 5 percent\nOther features: The Bt horizon contains some visible calcium carbonate in all subhorizons.  The amount of calcium carbonate or mixing by roots or fauna is enough that orientation of silicate clay on sand grains has been obliterated in some parts of the horizon.  High-calcium carbonate parts of the Bt horizon tend to be harder (hard or very hard) than are low-calcium carbonate parts because of calcium carbonate cementation.\nBkm horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR (with some included parts of 5YR)\nValue:  7 through 9 dry, 6 through 8 moist\nChroma:  1 through 4, dry or moist\nCoarse fragments:  less than 20 percent\nOther features: The Bkm horizon is indurated throughout, except that it is intermittently interrupted by pipes into which the Bt horizon dips and thus thickens markedly.\nBk, Bk' and C horizons\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  5 through 9 dry, 4 through 8 moist\nChroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist\nTexture:  sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, sand and gravelly sand\nCoarse fragments:  5 to 30 percent, mainly gravel\nOther features: In some pedons, the Bk horizons from 28 to 46 inches contain less calcium carbonate and more reddish, similar to that in the Btk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rotura soils occur on level or nearly level, very gently undulating basin floors or marginal basin floor positions and have formed in sandy, generally low gravel sediments of mid-Pleistocene age.  In places, such as along the Rio Grande Valley in the vicinity of the type location, streams have trenched the basin floor and the underlying sediments to depths of several hundred feet.  In such situations, valley margins of the basin-floor soils are commonly marked by prominent scarps formed of the thick, high-calcium carbonate horizons of the Rotura soils or their associates.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 3800 to 4500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 to 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 56 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 190 to 220 days."

The Cruces and Tencee soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths within 20 inches of the surface.  The Bucklebar soils are fine-loamy and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  The Sonoita soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 28 inches (BAt, Btk1, Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 28 to 46 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon - The zone from 46 to 80 inches (Bkm1, Bkm2, Bkm3 horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for the typical pedon, S61(65) NMex-7-8, published on p. 860 and 861 in Gile, L.H. and R.B. Grossman. 1979.  The Desert Project Soil Monograph.  National Technical Information Service.  A summary table of data is also in the Desert Project Guidebook (p. 114).  Data for horizons above the petrocalcic horizon are available for two other Rotura pedons (p. 962-965, Desert Project Soil Monograph).  Further information on the Rotura soils are in Gile (1966a, 1967b) and in Gile, Peterson and Grossman (1966), references cited in the Desert Project Soil Monograph. Additional information for the Rotura soils is in a 1990 Ph.D. thesis by H. Curtis Monger, entitled Soil mineral transformations in a southern New Mexico Aridisol:  pedogenic palygorskite, mineral dissolution and microbial-related calcite.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
