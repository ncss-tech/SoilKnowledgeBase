    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days in most years.  The upper part of the 10 to 40 inch control section contains 2 to 10 percent clay.  The lower part of the control section is loamy sand or sand.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 35 inches. Rock fragments in the control section range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  It contains 0 to 5 percent iron concretions.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist or dry. It is loamy sand, sand, or fine sand."

The soils formed in glacial outwash.  They have cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 65 inches, most of which falls between October and April.  Some snow falls in winter.  The average January temperature is about 38 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 66 degree F.; and the frost free season ranges from 150 to 212 days."

Alderwood and Harstine soils have dense glacial till at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Everett soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Indianola soils have a sandy control section.  Kitsap soils are a fine-silty."

Many areas are used for homesites.  The dominant overstory is Douglas-fir, Pacific madrone. western hemlock, red alder, and western redcedar with an understory of salal, Oregon-grape, huckleberry, western brackenfern, western swordfern, trailing blackberry, and evergreen huckleberry."
