  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roselms soils are on slightly elevated areas that have a convex surface or are on gently sloping areas along drainageways. They are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in very fine-textured, calcareous lacustrine material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 175 to 244 meters (575 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Broughton soils are on gently sloping to steep dissected areas along drainageways. The very poorly drained Paulding soils are on broad, nearly level areas of the lake plain. Defiance and Wabasha soils are on nearby flood plains."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 30 cm (0.5 to 1.0 foot) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Permeability is very slow."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 81 cm (Bt, Btg horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 23 cm.\nAdditional work is needed to determine if the clay and silty clay surface phases of Roselms should be in the Aeric Vertic subgroup. The previously correlated surface phases of fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam will need studied during update activities. It is likely that they will meet the criteria for an abrupt textural change and be reclassified into the Albaqualfs.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for pedons DF-33 (the typical pedon), DF-25, DF-31, PD-7, PD-9, PD-42, and WL-13. This data should be evaluated in the future to determine if it supports the current series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
