  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 81 cm (Bt, Btg horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 23 cm.\nAdditional work is needed to determine if the clay and silty clay surface phases of Roselms should be in the Aeric Vertic subgroup. The previously correlated surface phases of fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam will need studied during update activities. It is likely that they will meet the criteria for an abrupt textural change and be reclassified into the Albaqualfs.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for pedons DF-33 (the typical pedon), DF-25, DF-31, PD-7, PD-9, PD-42, and WL-13. This data should be evaluated in the future to determine if it supports the current series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
