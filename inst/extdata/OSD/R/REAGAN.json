  "OVERVIEW": "The Reagan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable calcareous soils that formed in alluvium and/or eolian deposits derived from limestone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on broad flats, filled valleys and fans. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
