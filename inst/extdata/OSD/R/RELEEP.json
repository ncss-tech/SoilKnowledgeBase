  "OVERVIEW": "The Releep series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to grus, and deep to hard granite bedrock.  These soils formed in residuum, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from coarse grained granitic bedrock. These soils are on ridges and sideslopes of mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
