About half the acreage has been partially or completely reclaimed, the rest is slightly to strongly affected by salts and sodium.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 60 to 80 percent.\nAp and A horizons\nHue: 10YR through Neutral (N).\nEffervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 10 percent.\nSalinity (EC): 0 to 32 mmhos/cm.\nOther features: Hand textures often feel lower in clay due to the presence of diatomaceous material in the silt and clay fractions.\nC horizons\nHue: 2.5Y or 5Y.\nTexture: Clay or silty clay with occasional thin (less than 15 cm) strata of loam through silty clay loam.\nClay content: Average 60 to 80 percent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent.\nSalinity (EC): 0 to 16 mmhos/cm.\nSodicity (SAR): 13 to 30.\nOther features: Occasional small calcium carbonate concretions may occur in the lower part of the profile; Fresh water mollusk shells may be present in any layer in the profile; Minor amounts of gypsum are common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ryepatch soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and influenced by diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 1,190 to 1,220 meters.  The climate is arid with cold, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Ryepatch soils are used mainly for irrigated agriculture.  The main crops are small grains and alfalfa.  Large areas that previously had a saline-sodic condition were cropped to tall wheatgrass for both soil improvement and pasture for beef cattle.  Areas free of salts and sodium are very productive.  Most areas have been drained and reclaimed, and other large areas are partially drained and reclaimed.  The native vegetation in uncultivated areas is black greasewood, inland saltgrass, and basin wildrye."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 99 cm (Ap, A1, A2, and A3 horizons).\nThe Vertic subgroup placement is based on the estimated linear extensibility (LE) as populated in the NASIS database.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (A1, A2, and A3 horizons and part of the 2C horizon).\nThe revision of July 2009 changed the classification from Cumulic Vertic Endoaquolls to Vertic Haploxerolls after evaluation of the present water table and irreversible drainage.\nThe revision of July 2007 moved the type location to another pedon within the Lovelock Area, Nevada and updated the taxonomic class from Very-fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Fluvaquentic Vertic Endoaquolls.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number 56NV027007 (pedon # 40A3234).  An additional pedon is soil survey sample number 61NV027003 (pedon # 40A3235).  These are published is SSIR # 23 for Nevada on pages 180-183.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
