  "OVERVIEW": "The Ryepatch series consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and influenced by diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash.  Ryepatch soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

The climate is arid with cold, moist winters and hot, dry summers.

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Ryepatch soils are used mainly for irrigated agriculture.  The main crops are small grains and alfalfa.  Large areas that previously had a saline-sodic condition were cropped to tall wheatgrass for both soil improvement and pasture for beef cattle.  Areas free of salts and sodium are very productive.  Most areas have been drained and reclaimed, and other large areas are partially drained and reclaimed.  The native vegetation in uncultivated areas is black greasewood, inland saltgrass, and basin wildrye."

An additional pedon is soil survey sample number 61NV027003 (pedon # 40A3235).  These are published is SSIR # 23 for Nevada on pages 180-183.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
