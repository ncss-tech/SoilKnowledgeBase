  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rupley series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in noncalcareous sandy sediments derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These gently sloping soils are on terraces of coastal plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 in).",
