  "OVERVIEW": "The Roanhide series consists of moderately deep over bedrock, well\ndrained soils on hills and mountains.  They formed in material from\nintermediate intrusive rocks.  Permeability is moderately rapid.\nSlopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about\n14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
