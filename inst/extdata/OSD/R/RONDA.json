  "STATES": "NC",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ronda series consists of very deep, excessively drained sandy soils on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains in the mesic Southern Piedmont. They formed in sandy alluvium washed from soils formed in residuum from schist, gneiss, granite, phyllite, and other metamorphic and igneous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 48 inches and mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F. near the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to hard bedrock is more than 10 feet. Layers of gravel and cobbles are in the substrata of some pedons below a depth of 40 inches. Few to many mica flakes are present throughout the profile. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. The A and C horizons to a depth of 40 inches are sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. In addition, The C horizon may be fine sand within a depth of 40 inches. Below a depth of 40 inches, textures of the C horizon range from sand to loam or are stratified.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons have an Ab horizon below a depth of 40 inches that has the same color and texture range of the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. Chroma 2 or less mottles are in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches but are not iron depletions associated with wetness."
