  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches.\nMost pedons contain a few black concretions.\nThe A horizon is black (10YR 2/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), or\nvery dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2).  The lower part of\nthe A horizon is commonly, distinctly, or prominently mottled dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4, 3/4).  The A horizon is clay loam,\nsilty clay, or clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately\nalkaline.  The A1 horizon is calcareous in the uppermost 10 inches\nof some pedons.\nThe B2g horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1; 5Y 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or light grayish brown (10YR 6/2) with common to many mottles of gray,\nbrown, and yellow.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or\nclay loam.  Between the depths of 10 and 40 inches the control section is 35 to 55 percent clay and less than 30 percent sand.  Reaction of the B2g horizon ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  Some part of the control section is medium acid,\nslightly acid, or neutral.  Some pedons have pockets and lenses of loamy material, but bedding planes have been destroyed.\nBuried A horizons are common below a depth of 30 inches.  They are dark gray (10YR 4/1) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1) with brown\nmottles.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or silty clay.  Reaction\nranges from strongly acid through slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Competing series are the\nGladewater, Griffith, Harris, Houlka, Iberia, Ijam, Kaman,\nKaufman, Leeper, Osage, Roellen, Terouge, and the Trinity series.  Gladewater, Houlka, Ijam, and Leeper soils have no mollic\nepipedon.  Griffith, Kaman, Osage, and Terouge soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 24 inches.  Harris soils are saline and are saturated for 4 to 8 months in most years.  Iberia soils have temperatures of about 68 degrees F., occur in areas of higher rainfall, and are wet for longer periods of time.  Kaufman and Trinity soils have intersecting slickensides and very-fine\ntextured control sections.  Roellen soils are in cooler climates.  GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are in flood plains that have many scour channels and depressions.  They formed in clayey and loamy\nsediments, mainly from the Blackland Prairies.  Slope is\ndominantly less than 1 percent.  The soils are frequently flooded October through May.  The average annual precipitation at the type location is about 45 inches, the average annual temperature is 64 degrees F., and the Thornthwiate P-E index is about 67.  GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Associated soils are the competing Kaufman and Terouge series and the Ambia, Elbon, Lassiter,\nNahatche, and Pledger soils.  Ambia soils have no mollic epipedon.  Elbon soils have mixed mineralogy and are calcareous throughout.  Lassiter and Nahatche soils are less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Pledger soils have redder hues in the lower part\nof the B horizon."
