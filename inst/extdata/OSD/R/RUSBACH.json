  "OVERVIEW": "The Rusbach series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on mountains and canyons.  Slopes are 40 to 80 percent. They formed in colluvium derived from tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
