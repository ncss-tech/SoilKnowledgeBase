  "OVERVIEW": "The Rusbach series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on mountains and canyons. They formed in colluvium derived from tuff.  Slopes are 40 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
