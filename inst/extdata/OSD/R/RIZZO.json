    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carrizo (CA+AZ NV), Carrwash (NV AZ), Chemwash (CA), Descent (CA) and Goldenhills (CA) series. Carrizo and Carrwash soils receive greater precipitation, are moist for 10 to 20 days in the moisture control section and have a MAST of 22 to 25 degrees C. Carrwash and Chemwash soils are also dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel in the particle-size control section. Descent soils are dominated by channers and flagstones and have greater than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in all horizons throughout the control section. Goldenhills soils formed in colluvium over residuum and are deep to a lithic contact."

These soils formed in alluvium from various igneous and metamorphic rocks. Elevations are 140 to 880 meters (460 to 2,885 feet). The climate is arid with warm, dry winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 26 degrees C (73.5 to 79 degrees F). The frost-free season is 360 to 365 days."

Chemehuevi, Deprave, Emptygun, Havasulake, Snaggletooth and Rockhound soils occur on fan remnants and have an argillic horizon. Deprave, Havasulake and Rockhound soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and Snaggletooth soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. In addition, Deprave soils have a duripan and Chemehuevi, Emptygun and Snaggletooth soils have a calcic horizon."

Rizzo soils are restricted to the extreme aridic, very low precipitation zones of the lower Colorado Desert where they should replace the existing Carrizo series. Previous type location is correlated to Carrizo series (MLRA 30 soil). The new type location is in MLRA 31.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 5/2012. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
