  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline and calcareous or noncalcareous in the A and B horizons.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth.  Clay content in the 10 to 40 inch control section is 25 to 34 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chromas of 1 to 3.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have hue of 7.5YR in some part of the B horizon.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  Some pedons contain Ab horizons below about 24 inches.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  Segregated soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate range from 1 to 20 percent by volume."

Bippus, Bosque, and Medley soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Cuero soils have Bt horizons.  Degola soils are moist in the control section for longer periods of time.  Laredo and Primer soils have fine-silty control sections. Sinton soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods.  Tordia soils have more than 35 percent clay in the their control sections and a COLE of more than 0.07 in the upper 1.25 meters."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ramadero soils occur in long, narrow and shallow valleys that serve as drainageways for the adjacent smooth upland plains.  Surfaces are concave with slope gradients less than 1 percent.  These soils receive extra water most years.  The soil formed in alkaline loamy alluvium. The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 70 degrees to 74 degrees F., Frost free days range from 250 to 320 days and elevation ranges from 100 to 600 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 20 to 31."

Brennan, Copita, McAllen, and Zapata soils do not have mollic epipedons.  In addition, Brennan soils have Bt horizons, Copita soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone at depths of less than 40 inches, and Zapata soils have sola less than 20 inches thick over a petrocalcic horizon.  Catarina soils have more than 35 percent clay in their control sections and the soil cracks widely and deeply when dry."
