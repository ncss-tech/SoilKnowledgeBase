  "OVERVIEW": "The Rauster series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. Rauster soils are on sideslopes and footslopes of hills and ridges and escarpments of cuestas. Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
