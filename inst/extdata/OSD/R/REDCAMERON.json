  "OVERVIEW": "The Redcameron series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone on mountain slopes, ridges, and hogbacks.  Slopes range from 20 to 55 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  These soils are calcareous throughout.  The particle-size control section of the fine-earth is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam, and averages 8 to 18 percent clay.  Sandstone channer content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  The moisture control section in most years is dry in some parts more than one-half the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but in most years is moist in some parts more than 60 consecutive days in late summer and early fall.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2.  Reaction is moderately alkaline."

It is moist during April, May, and early June when precipitation is at a peak.\nYellowwash soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have hue of 10YR and yellower."
