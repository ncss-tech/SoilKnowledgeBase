  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 34 inches and depth to bedrock from 4 to 7 feet.  The soil, unless limed, ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid in the A and B horizons and is slightly acid of neutral in the C horizon.  Rock fragments ranging in size from gravel to boulders occupy from 3 to 20 percent of individual horizons throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hues of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 3 to 5, and the chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hues of 2.5Y to 5GY, values of 4 or 5, and the chroma of 3 to 6.  It has subhorizons of clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, silt loam, or loam with weighted average clay content of 27 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe C horizon has hues of 2.5Y to 5G, values of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Abrupt differences in texture are common in the C horizon which ranges from silt loam to sandy loam.  The red and greenish mineral specks in various parts of the pedon appear to be characteristic of the series."

Belmont, Belmore, Chili, Coggon, Conestoga, Douds, El Dara, Gallman, Grellton, Hayden, Hebron, Hickory, High Gap, Hollinger, Kalamazoo, Kanawha, Kendallville, Kidder, Leroy, Lindley, Mandeville, Martinsville, McHenry, Riddles, Sisson, Strawn, Summitville, Theresa, Westville, Whalan, and Woodbine soils lack coarse fragments dominated by gabbro, granodiorite or metagabbro and have hues of 10YR or redder in the B horizons.  Chenault soils formed in alluvium over limestone in Karst topography.  Letort soils have sola thicker than 40 inches and coarse fragments dominated by quartz, chert, limestone and phyllite.  Mifflin, Nodine, Princeton, Renova, Richland and Skelton soils have thicker sola.  Norden soils have glauconitic sandstone bedrock within 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Relay soils are on uplands near the eastern margin of the northern Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  Topography is dominated by rounded steep hills and deeply incised ravines that are commonly rough and stony, with broken complex slopes.  The soil formed in residuum from coarsely crystalline magnesium-rich basic rocks such as gabbro, metagabbro and granodiorite.  The climate is temperate and humid, with a mean annual temperature of 50 to 57 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation of 35 to 45 inches.  Frost-free days range from 160 to 200."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previously revised by WDC in 1990. The 03/2004 revision places this soil into an active cation-exchange activity class and the series changed to very deep to bedrock rather than allowing deep and very deep. Also, all layer depths moved down by two inches to switch the Oi depths of 2 to 0 inches to 0 to 2 inches instead.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric Epipedon -- The zone from the soil surface to a depth of approximately 10 inches (Oi, A, and E horizons)\nb. Albic Horizon -- The zone from 6 to 10 inches (E horizon)\nc. Argillic horizon -- The zone from approximately 10 to 29 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
