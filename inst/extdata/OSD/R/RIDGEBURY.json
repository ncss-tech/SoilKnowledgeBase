  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the dense till commonly is 36 to 49 cm. The A horizon has 5 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent stones by volume. The B and C horizons have 5 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones. Rock fragments within the soil range from 5 to 35 percent by volume and are subangular fragments. The unlimed soil ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2, 2.5, or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe A or Ap horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2, 2.5, or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is the same as the A horizon.\nThe B horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3. The chroma is 4 in some places. Chroma of 3 or 4 is restricted to subhorizons. Redoximorphic features are few to many and are distinct or prominent. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy or loam in the fine earth fraction with fifteen percent or more fine sand or coarser and clay content less than 18 percent. The B horizon has subangular blocky structure, weak to moderate very thin to medium platy structure or is massive. It is very friable or friable.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It commonly has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features which generally become less abundant with depth but the range includes faint. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is firm or very firm and brittle. It is massive or has plates. Any physical aggregation is considered to not be pedogenic.\nSome pedons have a C horizon below the Cd that is firm but not brittle."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series currently in the same family.\nThe Painesville, Punsit, and Sun series are in a closely related family. Painesville soils lack a densic contact. Punsit soils have more than 60 percent silt plus very fine sand in the particle size control section. Sun soils formed in till derived from limestone and sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The nearly level to gently sloping Ridgebury soils are in depressions and drainageways of till uplands. They also occur in toeslope positions and concave microfeatures of hills, drumlins, and ground moraines, and in till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in loamy lodgment till derived mainly from granite, gneiss and schist. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 mm. Mean growing season ranges from 100 to 195 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Charlton, Chatfield, Hollis, Leicester, Paxton and Sutton, Whitman and Woodbridge soils. Ridgebury is a member of a drainage sequence that includes the well drained Paxton, moderately well drained Woodbridge, and very poorly drained Whitman soils. Charlton and Sutton soils are better drained and have friable substrata. Chatfield and Hollis soils have bedrock within depths of 100 and 50 cm respectively. Leicester soils do not have a densic contact."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Commonly poorly drained but the range includes the wetter part of somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is negligible to medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and very low to moderately low in the substratum. A perched, fluctuating water table above the dense till saturates the solum to or near the surface for 7 to 9 months of the year."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: An analysis of Ridgebury soils in 2002 for 38 surveys showed that this series most commonly has a densic contact at 40 to 60 cm including 8 surveys with the depth to a densic contact at 50 cm. The average depth to a densic contact was 50 cm - the data showed an almost even split between depth class occurrences. A review of characterization data for Ridgebury soils shows a very slight dominance in the acid reaction class. Any physical aggregation in the Cd is considered to not be pedogenic. The type location is currently within the officially designated mesic zone in Massachusetts. Previous revision of this series was 12/2005.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 cm (A horizon).\n2. Aeric feature 100 percent of the zone from 13 to 23 cm has hue of 10YR and both color value moist of 4 and chroma moist of 3 (Bw1 horizon).\n3. Cambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 46 cm (Bw and Bg horizons).\n3. Densic contact root limiting material begins at 46 cm (Cd horizon).\n4. Endosaturation the zone from 23 to 46 cm is saturated above the densic contact (Bw2 horizon). A seasonal high water table is perched above the densic materials.\n5. Reaction - the pH in the zone from 25 to 46 cm (control section for reaction) is presumed less than 5.0 in 0.01 M CaCl2 (1:2) (see remarks).\n6. Series control section - the zone from 0 to 71 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples from pedons with User Pedon IDs of S2000CT013002, S1995NH013005, and S1996NH013002\nfrom Connecticut and New Hampshire, samples by NSSL, Lincoln, NE, various years. The laboratory data for these pedons and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
