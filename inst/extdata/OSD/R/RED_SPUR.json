  "OVERVIEW": "The Red Spur series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone.  These soils are on moderately steep to steep mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 32 inches.",

Cluff soils lack mollic epipedons and have very cobbly clay or very cobbly heavy clay loam argillic horizons. Mult soils lack albic horizons and have less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Scout soils lack both mollic epipedons and argillic horizons."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 56 inches.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 48 to 56 inches.  (entire argillic horizon)\nMollic epipedon (Pachic feature):  from 0 to 26 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon (Pale feature):  from 48 to 56 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nLithic contact:  the contact with sandstone at 56 inches.  (R layer)\nIt is unclear if this soil typically has albic colors in the E horizon and E part of the E/B horizon. Colors in the typical pedon could be interpreted as albic colors if they are due to uncoated grains. The ranges of these horizons include colors that are definitely not albic colors. Hence until this can be investigated neither an albic horizon nor a glossic horizon is within the typical concept of this series.\nThe 06/2011 revision updated the typical pedon description to be more consistent with the description in the Cache Valley Area published survey. The moisture regime was clarified as udic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
