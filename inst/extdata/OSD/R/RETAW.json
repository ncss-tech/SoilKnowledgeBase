Blackwell soils have a discontinuity of highly stratified materials at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Foolhen soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Furniss soils have a discontinuity of sandy-skeletal material at a depth of 40 inches and deeper.  Haydenfork soils display endoaquic soil moisture conditions at 0 to 10 inches in April to June. Vensora soils have skeletal textures within 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Retaw soils are on small rock basins of undulating high plateaus and mesas. The basins are rounded, closed depressions formed on sandstone bedrock and are 1 to about 50 acres in size. Most are covered with standing water year-round but smallest basins may dry out after successive years of drought. Runoff from melting winter snowpack and high-intensity summer thunderstorms fills the basins with water. Retaw soils formed in lacustrine sediments and alluvium derived from Tertiary sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Berland soils are very shallow to sandstone and occur on non-wooded knolls and benches. Bikeyah soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on open, grassy toeslopes. Captom soils lack Mollic epipedons and occur on steep backslopes. Klizhin soils have thick Mollic epipedons and occur on footslopes below Captom soils."
