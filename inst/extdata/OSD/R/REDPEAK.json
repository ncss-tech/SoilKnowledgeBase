  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redpeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum, colluvium and some till from sedimentary and volcanic rock sources of the Ventura Member of the Midnight Peak Formation, with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on backslopes and shoulders  of mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils do not meet the organic-carbon content of 0.6 or more for mollic epipedons.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 10 to 20 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 10 to 20 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hues of 2.5YR and 5YR, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hues of 2.5YR and 5YR, and values of 3 or 4 moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hues of 2.5YR and 5YR, values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam. It has 30 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."
