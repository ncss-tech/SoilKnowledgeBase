    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils do not meet the organic-carbon content of 0.6 or more for mollic epipedons.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 10 to 20 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 10 to 20 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hues of 2.5YR and 5YR, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hues of 2.5YR and 5YR, and values of 3 or 4 moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hues of 2.5YR and 5YR, values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam. It has 30 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

Brevco soils have coarse sandy loam textures in the C horizon and Thout soils lack a C horizon.  Coxit, Elkhorn, Jimbluff, Longort, Ontrail and Merkel soils are very deep.  Highhorn soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Huntrock soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Kamela have a Bw horizon with 18 to 27 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redpeak soils are on backslopes and shoulders of mountains.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 3,800 feet.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum, colluvium and some till from sedimentary and volcanic rock sources of the Ventura Member of the Midnight Peak Formation, with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F.; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Veridge soils are on northerly aspects and have an andic volcanic ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick."
