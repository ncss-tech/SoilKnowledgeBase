  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Depth to bedded sandstone is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 14 to 26 inches.  The soil is noncalcareous throughout.  The soil is moist in all parts of the moisture control section in April, May, and June but is dry in all parts for 60 consecutive days during the period July 15 to October 15.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Coarse sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 15 percent.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is a paralithic contact to well consolidated, noncalcareous, argillaceous sandstone.  Some discontinuous layers of hard sandstone may occur in some strata beneath the paralithic contact."

Alderon, Gateson, and Lengby soils have an E horizon.  Allen Park,  Bayerton, Fairport, Lumpgulch and Rule soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.   Bondoe soils are loamy-skeletal below the argillic horizon.  Elbeth, Haugan, Lakoa, and Plome soils are very deep.  Elmark soils have a paralithic and a lithic contact above 60 inches.  Ferball, Foreleft and Nebish soils are very deep, in addition the Nebish soils formed in Wisconsin age glacial till.  Snellman soils have moderately acid or slightly acid reaction in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Regnaps soils are on rock controlled hillslopes, fan aprons, and pediments.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 5,600 to 7,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches but ranges from 15 to 19 inches.  Over half the annual precipitation falls as snow or rain in the months of April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F. but ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 110 days, but frost may occur in any month except August."
