  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Racoon soils are on foot slopes or in depressions on terraces, lake plains, till plains, and high flood plains. Slopes typically are concave, but range to plane or convex and have gradients of 0 to 3 percent. Racoon soils formed in a mixture of loess and silty local alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1219 mm (34 to 48 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 107 to 213 meters (350 to 700 feet) above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ava, Banlic, Bluford, Bonnie, Cisne, Creal, Weir, and Wynoose soils. The moderately well drained Ava, the somewhat poorly drained Bluford, and the poorly drained Cisne soils are on higher lying positions of till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Banlic soils are adjacent to or slightly lower than Racoon soils on very low terraces or high flood plains. The poorly drained Bonnie soils are on flood plains below Racoon soils. The somewhat poorly drained Creal soils are commonly on slightly higher foot slopes. Weir and Wynoose soils are on till plains typically higher than Racoon soils."

Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table in drained conditions ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between March and June in normal years. A flooded phase is recognized with rare to occasional flooding for brief periods in the spring. Potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow."
