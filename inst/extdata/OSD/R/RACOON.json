  "OVERVIEW": "The Racoon series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on till plains, lake plains, terraces and high flood plains. Racoon soils formed in a mixture of loess and silty local alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Banlic soils are adjacent to or slightly lower than Racoon soils on very low terraces or high flood plains.
