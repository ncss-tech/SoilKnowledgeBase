  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruhe series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian sand and alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Ruhe soils are on lake terraces and beach terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
