    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ruhe soils are on lake terraces and beach terraces associated with the ancient shorelines of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan.  They formed in eolian sand and alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,200 to 1,350 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 175 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
