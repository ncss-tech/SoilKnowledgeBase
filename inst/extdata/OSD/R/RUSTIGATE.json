  "OVERVIEW": "The Rustigate series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Rustigate soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, alluvial flats, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
