    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 9 to 22 inches.  Depth to soft clay shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through extremely acid above a depth of 30 inches and from extremely acid to neutral below a depth of 30 inches, except where limed, the Ap horizon ranges to neutral. Coarse fragments of sandstone, siltstone or shale range from O to 35 percent .\nThe A1 horizon ranges from black (10YR 2/1) through grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2).  The Ap and A2 horizons range from light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) through olive gray (5Y 4/2).  They are silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon ranges from yellow (10YR 7/6) through olive gray (5Y 4/2); mottles or streaks are in shades of red, brown, olive, or gray; gray colors are thought to be inherited from the original clay shale; textures are silty clay loam, silty clay or clay; structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, angular or subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon ranges from dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) through light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6; mottles or streaks are in shades of red, brown, olive, or gray; textures are silty clay or clay."

The Cabode, Coolville, and Rarden soils have argillic horizons.  Colyer soils are less than 20 inches to hard black fissile shales.  Garmon soils contain less clay and are less acid.  Shrouts soils have thin argillic horizons and are much less acid."
