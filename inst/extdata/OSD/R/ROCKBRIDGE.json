  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockbridge series consist of well drained soils very deep to sandstone. These soils formed in the loess, in pedisediments, and in the loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone. These soils are on the hills in bedrock controlled uplands. Permeability is moderate in the loess, slow to moderate in the clayey pedisediment, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy residuum and slow to moderate in the sandstone. Slope ranges from 6 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation about 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
