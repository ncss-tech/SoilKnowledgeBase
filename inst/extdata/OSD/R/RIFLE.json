    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the organic soil layers exceeds 51 inches.  The organic material is estimated to be primarily herbaceous fibers, however, some pedons contain less than 15 percent by volume of woody fragments that cannot be crushed between the fingers.  The layers in the subsurface tier typically have pH of 4.5 to 6.5 in O.01M CaCl2, but range from pH 5.6 to 7.3.  The organic soil materials lack free carbonates in all parts of the control section.\nSome pedons contain surface layers composed of hemic or sapric material.   The layers in the surface tier are quite variable in color depending upon the stage of decomposition.  Hue ranges from 10YR to 5YR, value from 2 to 6, and chroma from 1 to 4.  The fibers in these layers are primarily coarse granular or weak thick platy structure or the layers in the subsurface and bottom tier have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, values of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 5.  Colors become darker upon brief exposure to air.  Rubbed colors have about the same range in the colors of broken faces, but in some pedons they differ by 0.5 to 1 unit in chroma or value or both.  The lighter colors are generally those of materials that contain more fiber.  The layers in the subsurface and bottom tier are commonly massive, but in some pedons they have weak thick platy structure.  The materials are dominantly of hemic material.  In some pedons, layers of fibric or sapric materials are within the subsurface and bottom tier but total thickness of either material is less than 10 inches.  Some pedons have limnic materials at depths of 51 inches or greater."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mooselake soils in the same family and the closely related Carbondale, Carlisle, Greenwood and Houghton series.   Mooselake soils have hemic material with mostly woody fiber.  Carbondale soils have sapric material dominant in the subsurface tier, and more than 10 inches of hemic material dominant in the subsurface and bottom tiers.  Carlisle and Houghton soils have sapric material dominant in the subsurface tier and are mesic. Greenwood soils are dysic."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 150 days and the elevation ranges from 600 to 1,950 feet."
