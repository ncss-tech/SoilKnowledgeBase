Texture is loam or gravelly loam.  Igneous rock fragment content is 10 to 20 percent gravel.  Reaction is slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value is 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma is 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Clay content is 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.
