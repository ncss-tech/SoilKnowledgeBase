  "OVERVIEW": "The Ripgut series are very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium dominantly from igneous rocks.  These soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
