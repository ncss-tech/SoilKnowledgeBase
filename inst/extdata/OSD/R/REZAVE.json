    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rezave soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
