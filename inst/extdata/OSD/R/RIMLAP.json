    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates typically is 24 to 38 inches, but, ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  These are also the maximum depths to which mollic colors extend.  The depth to till typically ranges from 40 to 60 inches, but is below 60 inches in some pedons.  The combined A and E horizons thickness and depth to the Bt horizon is 7 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam, but some pedons are loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam, but some pedons are loam or silty clay loam.  It has few to many distinct or prominent redox features.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue or 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam with clay content ranging from 35 to 55 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The Bt1 horizon typically has columnar or degraded columnar structure.  Redox features are usually only evident in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  They range from common to many and faint to prominent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue or 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline. It has few or common, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonates in most pedons.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum.  Redox features range from few to many and faint to prominent.  BC horizons are in some pedons.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are clay loam, silty clay loam or loam.  They are slightly or moderately alkaline.  Redox features range from common to many and faint to prominent.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum.  Some pedons do not have C horizons above the 2C horizon.  Some pedons do not have 2C horizons."

Arnegard, Bowbells, Niobell and Noonan soils are moderately well drained and are in swales and nearly level upland positions.  In addition, Niobell and Noonan soils have a natric horizon.  Heil, Parnell and Tonka soils are on similar landscapes.  Heil soils have a natric horizon and are less than 5 inches to the Bt horizon. Parnell soils do not have an albic horizon.  Tonka soils have a depth to the Bt horizon greater than 12 inches and lack an abrupt textural change from the albic to the argillic horizon.  Max and Williams are well drained and are on higher parts of the landscape."

Several pedons have been sampled for laboratory characterization.
