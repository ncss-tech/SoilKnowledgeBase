    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON:  Rockerville channery silt loam, on a northeast facing, slightly convex slope of 20 percent, in a  vegetative community consisting of an overstory of ponderosa pine and an understory of mixed grasses, forbs, and low shrubs, at an elevation of about 1,180 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 3, 2004 the soil was slightly moist throughout.\nOi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter consisting of ponderosa pine needles, cones, twigs, and detached roots.  (0 to 4 cm thick)\nA1--2 to 9 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) channery silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium and moderate very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; about 20 percent subangular limestone fragments; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.\nA2--9 to 18 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) channery silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; about 25 percent subangular limestone fragments; about 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strong effervescence;  slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

(0 to 20 cm thick)\nR--37 to 200 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) to white (10YR 8/1) hard, fractured limestone bedrock; fractures are typically about 0.5 cm wide at the narrowest part; distance between fractures ranges from about 40 to more than 90 cm."
