  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to limestone bedrock is more than 60 inches. Shale channers or parachanners range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum. Some pedons have few to many black or brown iron-manganese concretions in the argillic horizon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid or very strongly acid throughout the solum, except surface layers are less acid where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, is less than 8 inches thick, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture of the Bt is clay and clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 60 to 75 percent. Lithochromic Mottles retained from weathered shale are common.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is commonly variegated without dominant hue or chroma in various shades of gray, yellow, and red. Texture is clay. A few pedons have a similar BCt horizon with few clay films and stronger structure."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are presently no other series in this family. Close competitors are the Albertville, Carnasaw, Cullen, Enders, Fluvanna, Kirvin, Luverne, Masada, McQueen, Nason, Sweatman, Tatum, Townley, and Vance series. All of these, with the exception of Cullen series, have less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cullen soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and weathered from mixed mafic and felsic crystalline rocks or the Piedmont Plateau."
