  "OVERVIEW": "The Reywat series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from andesite and basalt.  Reywat soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Bellehelen, Brier and Nuhelen soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 cumulative days between July and October due to convection storms.  Duco and Orhood soils do not have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon, on the surface of the lithic contact, or in cracks within the bedrock.  Horseflat soils do not have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the Bt horizon, on the surface of the lithic contact, or in cracks within the bedrock.  Ocud soils average 15 to 25 clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the Bt horizon, on the surface of the lithic contact, or in cracks within the bedrock.  Upatad soils have horizons with significant accumulations of identifiable secondary carbonates and secondary silica."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reywat soils are hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They formed dominantly in residuum derived from andesite, basalt or similar volcanic rocks.  On steep slopes, colluvium is a major portion of the parent material.  Other areas have minor amounts of loess or volcanic ash in the A horizons.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  Most slopes have south aspects, but some face north, especially at the lower elevations.  Elevations range from 305 to 2,736 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 360 mm, including 460 to 1500 mm of snowfall.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 80 to 160 days."
