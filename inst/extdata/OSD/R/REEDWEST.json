  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. DRS-JAL-EMM",
  "REVDATE": "03/2014",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Reedwest series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from soft, calcareous, sandy and loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, dikes and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
