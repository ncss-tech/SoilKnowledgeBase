Redchief soils have average summer soil temperatures of 50 degrees F., have strongly acid Bt horizons and lack carbonates.  Rooset soils lacks 10YR hues in the argillic horizon and receive equal amounts of precipitation during most months.  Tatiyee soils have ustic soils moisture regimes and lack carbonates.  Tellura soils are noneffervescent above 40 inches.  Threedot soils lack carbonates and have E horizons.  Wilpar soils have weak or moderate subangular blocky structure in the Bt horizon and average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F."
