  "OVERVIEW": "The Resoot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  The Resoot soils are on moraines, ridges and mountain sides.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
