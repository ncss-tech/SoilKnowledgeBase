    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (C1, C2, 2C3, and 2C4 horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from the surface to 29 inches.  (A1, A2, C1, and C2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  The contact with sandy-skeletal material (dominated by cobbles) at the upper boundary of the 2C3 horizon.\nEndosaturation:  The zone of saturation from 20 to 40 inches during the months of March through July.\nThe particle-size control section placement is not coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal because the coarse-loamy material contains more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  The weighted average percent rock fragments for most pedons is 30 to 35 percent.\nThe SEC activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
