  "OVERVIEW": "The Rotagilla series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in colluvium from monzonite. These steep to very steep soils are on mountain tops and flanks.  Slope ranges from 35 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
