  "OVERVIEW": "The Ratleflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived predominantly from granitic rocks. Ratleflat soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
