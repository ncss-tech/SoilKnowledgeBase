Dinkelman soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact, have 25 to 35 percent coarse plus very coarse sand in the particle-size control section, and 15 to 35 percent angular granitic rock fragments. Kilmerque soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Lani soils have 25 to 35 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section. Lostcreek soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and are moderately well drained with redox concentrations below a depth of 30 inches. Thrapp soils are 36 to 45 inches deep to a densic contact and redox concentrations."

Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. They formed in alluvium and glacial till of mixed mineralogy with a component of loess and volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches, but ranges to 28 inches in Idaho. The frost free season is 60 to 130 days."

Apex soils have a volcanic ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick meeting andic soil properties and are on mountains and till plains. Elbowlake soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on backslopes, footslopes and toeslopes. Scoap soils are loamy-skeletal, have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and are on uplands and mountainsides. Garrison soils are mesic and are on outwash terraces. Hunters soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and are on terraces. Mire and Molson soils have a medial upper control section.   Mire soils are on upland slopes.  Scoap soils are on uplands and mountainsides.  Stevens soils are mesic and are on hillsides."

The native vegetation in Washington is ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with an understory ranging from bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, prairie Junegrass, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, and wild rose to common snowberry, white spirea and Saskatoon serviceberry (moist phase). The native vegetation in Idaho is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and mallow ninebark."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the mineral surface to 17 inches with the zone from 17 to 24 inches having less than 0.6 percent organic carbon\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches having an average of 22 percent rock fragments.\nBase saturation (by sum of cations) is estimated to be less than 75 percent in parts of the upper 30 inches of the soil, based on lab data from similar soils.\nClassification revision 12/01 from coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls to coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls.\nThis series has been correlated into the Boise County, Idaho survey based on similarities with the Republic series concept with consideration of the very limited extent. These soils occur in a 26 to 28 inch precipitation zone in MLRA 44 on protected backslopes of uplifted and dissected fan remnants of early Pleistocene age. These periglacial deposits are auriferous and have a history of significant hydraulic mining activities.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  S94WA-047-005.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
