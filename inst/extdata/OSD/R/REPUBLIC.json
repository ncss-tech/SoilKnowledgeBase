Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. They formed in alluvium and glacial till of mixed mineralogy with a component of loess and volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches, but ranges to 28 inches in Idaho. The frost free season is 60 to 130 days."

Elbowlake soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on backslopes, footslopes and toeslopes. Scoap soils are loamy-skeletal, have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and are on uplands and mountainsides. Garrison soils are mesic and are on outwash terraces. Hunters soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and are on terraces. Mire and Molson soils have a medial upper control section.   Mire soils are on upland slopes.  Scoap soils are on uplands and mountainsides.  Stevens soils are mesic and are on hillsides."

The native vegetation in Idaho is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and mallow ninebark."

These soils occur in a 26 to 28 inch precipitation zone in MLRA 44 on protected backslopes of uplifted and dissected fan remnants of early Pleistocene age. These periglacial deposits are auriferous and have a history of significant hydraulic mining activities."
