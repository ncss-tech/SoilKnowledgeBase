  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Competing series in closely related families include the Americus, Davidson, Greenville, Lucedale, and Pine Flat series.  The Americus soil has a sandy particle-size control section; the Lucedale soil has more than 20 percent silt in its' particle-size control section; and the Pine Flat soil is coarse-loamy.  The Davidson and Greenville soils have a clayey particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Red Bay soils are on broad ridgetops and on side slopes on uplands of the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  They developed in thick beds of unconsolidated, loamy marine sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 60 inches."

The Americus and Pine Flat series are on similar positions as the Red Bay soils or are on side slopes.  Greenville soils are on slightly lower positions on the landscape.  The Lucy and Troup soils are on adjacent side slopes and have thick sandy epipedons.  Orangeburg soils are on slightly higher positions and have kandic horizons with moist color value of 4 or more."
