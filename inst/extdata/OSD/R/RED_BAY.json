  "OVERVIEW": "The Red Bay series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in thick beds of unconsolidated, loamy marine sediments on uplands of the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 53 inches.",

It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe BA or BE horizon, present in some pedons, is less than 10 inches thick and has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Silt content is less than 20 percent."

Competing series in closely related families include the Americus, Davidson, Greenville, Lucedale, and Pine Flat series.  The Americus soil has a sandy particle-size control section; the Lucedale soil has more than 20 percent silt in its' particle-size control section; and the Pine Flat soil is coarse-loamy.  The Davidson and Greenville soils have a clayey particle-size control section."

They developed in thick beds of unconsolidated, loamy marine sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 60 inches."

The Americus and Pine Flat series are on similar positions as the Red Bay soils or are on side slopes.  Greenville soils are on slightly lower positions on the landscape.  The Lucy and Troup soils are on adjacent side slopes and have thick sandy epipedons.  Orangeburg soils are on slightly higher positions and have kandic horizons with moist color value of 4 or more."
