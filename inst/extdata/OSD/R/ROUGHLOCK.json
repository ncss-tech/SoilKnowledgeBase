  "OVERVIEW": "The Roughlock series consists of deep, well drained soils on footslopes, alluvial fans, and dipslopes.  They formed in alluvium derived dominantly from calcareous, red siltstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
