  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This soil is usually moist, but is dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days during the late summer and autumn. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 61 degrees to 65 degrees F. The thickness of the solum is 30 to 50 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick. Usually the soil is weakly to strongly effervescent in the B3 or C horizons, but some pedons are noncalcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay or clay loam and averages more than 35 percent clay. It contains up to 5 percent fine pebbles.\nThe C horizon is gravelly loamy coarse sand through loam."

Goodington soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Harkers soils have 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the B2t horizon. Norcan soils have an O horizon and have sola more than 60 inches thick. Zumwalt soils have an A2 horizons and are moderately deep over bedrock."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium are dominantly 2 to 11 percent. Elevation is 4,800 to 6,000 feet. The soils formed in mixed alluvium mainly from andesite and volcanic tuff.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees to 43 degrees F. The climate is Humid mainly from andesite and volcanic tuff. Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees to 43 degrees F. The climate is Humid continental, cool summers (Trewartha's modified Koppen system) with cold moist winters and dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and average frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."
