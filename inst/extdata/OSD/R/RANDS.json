  "OVERVIEW": "The Rands series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks. Rands soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 61 degrees to 65 degrees F. The thickness of the solum is 30 to 50 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick. Usually the soil is weakly to strongly effervescent in the B3 or C horizons, but some pedons are noncalcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay or clay loam and averages more than 35 percent clay. It contains up to 5 percent fine pebbles.\nThe C horizon is gravelly loamy coarse sand through loam."

Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees to 43 degrees F. The climate is Humid mainly from andesite and volcanic tuff. Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees to 43 degrees F. The climate is Humid continental, cool summers (Trewartha's modified Koppen system) with cold moist winters and dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and average frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."
