  "OVERVIEW": "The Riggsville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. Riggsville soils are on moraines, drumlins, lake terraces and till plains. They formed in sandy deposits and the underlying loamy till. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
