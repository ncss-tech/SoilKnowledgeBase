  "OVERVIEW": "The Reepo series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Reepo soils are on structural benches and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
