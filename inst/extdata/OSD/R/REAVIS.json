  "OVERVIEW": "The Reavis series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial outwash with an influence of mixed loess and volcanic ash in the surface layer. Reavis soils are on outwash plains. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Araveton, Causey, Kerl, and Picayune soils lack the underlying very gravelly glacial outwash materials and have a calcic horizon at depths less than 30 inches. In addition, Picayune soils have B horizons containing 20 to 50 percent limestone rock fragments and particle-size control sections with more than 27 percent clay. Kauvasz soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact (basalt)."
