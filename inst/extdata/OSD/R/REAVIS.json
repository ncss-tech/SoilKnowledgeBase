The soils are usually moist but are dry in the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to the very gravelly calcic horizon is 30 to 44 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section average 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, with 5 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel. It is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 and 4 moist and dry. It is silt loam or loam 18 to 27 percent clay and with 0 to 10 percent gravel. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Araveton, Causey, Kerl, Kuvasz (T) and Picayune soils. Araveton, Causey, Kerl, and Picayune soils lack the underlying very gravelly glacial outwash materials and have a calcic horizon at depths less than 30 inches. In addition, Picayune soils have B horizons containing 20 to 50 percent limestone rock fragments and particle-size control sections with more than 27 percent clay. Kauvasz soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact (basalt)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Reavis soils are on gently undulating glacial outwash plains at elevations of 3,600 to 4,400 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in glaciofluvial outwash with an influence of mixed loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface horizons. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
