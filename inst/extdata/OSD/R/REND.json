  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rend soils are on convex summits and shoulder slopes and on convex to linear back slopes of valley benches, mainly adjacent to tributaries of the Mississippi River.  Slope ranges from 5 to 10 percent.  Rend soils formed in 41 to 102cm (16 to 40 inches) of Peorian loess and in 76 to 152cm (30 to 60 inches) of other silty to loamy materials which overly valley fill materials.  The second increment of silty material is thought to be erosional sediments (pedisediment) or locally reworked A horizon of paleosols and early Wisconsinan loess (mixed zone).  It often contains a few igneous pebbles or coarse fragments from local bedrock deposited as glacial drift.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F)."
