  "OVERVIEW": "The Rathbun series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils occur on summits of interfluves, side slopes, and treads on high stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 2 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.",
