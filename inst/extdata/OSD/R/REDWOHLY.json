  "REVDATE": "07/2016",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redwohly series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from mudstone and sandstone. Redwohly soils are 50 to 100 centimeters deep to paralithic bedrock material with cracks closer than 10 centimeters apart. Redwohly soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
