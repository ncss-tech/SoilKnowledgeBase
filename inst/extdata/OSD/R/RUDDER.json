  "OVERVIEW": "The Rudder series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in breccia, andesite, and basalt. Rudder soils are on side slopes of mountains on islands. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 457 millimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",

Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 4/2, or 4/3.\nThe Bw horizon dry color is 10YR 6/3, 6/4 or 5/4. Moist color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/3 or 4/4.\nTextures are gravelly sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam.\nClay films: Very few to few clay films occur in some pedons. These are not argillic horizons."
