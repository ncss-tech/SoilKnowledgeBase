    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about mid-September to mid-November (about 90 days) and is usually moist the rest of the time.\nThe mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm (20 inches) is between than 12 and 15 degrees C (54 and 59 degrees F) and the mean summer and mean winter temperatures vary less than 6 degrees C.\nBase saturation by sum of bases ranges from 45 to 75 percent.\nDepth to bedrock is 32 to 104 centimeters (13 to 41 inches) but is best represented by 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).\nThe particle size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay, and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 5/2, 6/2, or 6/3. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 4/2, or 4/3.\nThe Bw horizon dry color is 10YR 6/3, 6/4 or 5/4. Moist color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/3 or 4/4.\nTextures are gravelly sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam.\nClay films: Very few to few clay films occur in some pedons. These are not argillic horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rudder soils are on northerly side slopes of mountains on islands. They formed in breccia, andesite, and basalt. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 700 to 1600 feet (213 to 488 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with fog throughout the year. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches (330 to 610 mm) the mean annual temperature is 55 to 61 degrees F (13 to 16 degrees C), and the frost free season is 320 to 365 days."
