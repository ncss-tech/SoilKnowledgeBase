  "OVERVIEW": "The Rojo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from lacustrine tuff and volcanic ash.  Rojo soils are on undulating terraces and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 8 to 24 inches is dry in all parts from about June 15 until November 10 (145 days).  The soil moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Mollic epipedon ranges from 11 to 15 inches.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/2 or 5YR 5/2 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/2.  Gravel range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 6/2, 6/4, 5YR 6/3 or 7/3 and moist color of 7.5YR 5/4, 5YR 4/3, 5/3 or 5/4.  Gravel range from 0 to 10 percent.
