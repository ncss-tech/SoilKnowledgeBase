    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to the duripan ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 8 to 24 inches is dry in all parts from about June 15 until November 10 (145 days).  The soil moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Mollic epipedon ranges from 11 to 15 inches.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/2 or 5YR 5/2 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/2.  Gravel range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 6/2, 6/4, 5YR 6/3 or 7/3 and moist color of 7.5YR 5/4, 5YR 4/3, 5/3 or 5/4.  Gravel range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline."
