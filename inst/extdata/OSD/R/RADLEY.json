The soils formed in stratified silty alluvium.  Climate is moist subhumid to humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 970 to 1190 mm (38 to 47 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C. (57 to 64 degrees F.).  Elevation is 152 to 282 meters (500 to 925 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index is 64 to 82."

Verdigris and Wynona soils contain a mollic epipedon greater than 61 cm thick.  McCune soils occur on flood plain steps.  Dennis, Parsons, Cherokee and Lula soils occur on uplands.  Zaar soils contain an argillic horizon.  Osage and Lightning soils have a fine control section and high shrink-swell properties."
