  "OVERVIEW": "The Radley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified silty alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
