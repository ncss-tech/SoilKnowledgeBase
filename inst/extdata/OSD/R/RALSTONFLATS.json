  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ralstonflats series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium. Ralstonflats soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 309 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
