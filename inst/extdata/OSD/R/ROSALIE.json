    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to over 100 inches.  The control section is sandy clay loam or clay loam with a weighted average clay content of 20 to 30 percent.  Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 35 percent, and the calcium content exceeds 1me/100 grams of soil.\nThe A and E horizons are loamy fine sand or loamy sand throughout and contain few to common coarse fragments.  They are very strongly acid through sligtly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma  of 3 or 4.\nThe E horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Some pedons have a few fine and medium mottles of red, yellowish red, and gray.  From 5 to 20 percent of this horizon consists of pockets and streaks of uncoated sand and silt E materials.  Texture of the horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt and BC horizons are mottled in shades of yellowish brown, brownish yellow, gray, light gray, grayish brown, strong brown, dark red, or red.  The gray is dominant in the lower part of some pedons.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam with few to common pockets or vertical streaks of uncoated sand grains.  Sandy loam textures occur below 60 inches in some pedons.  Plinthite in the lower part of the Bt horizon of some pedons constitutes up to 5 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid."

Autryville, Bonneau, Letney and Wagram soils do not have skeletons of uncoated sand in the upper Bt horizon.  Boykin, Briley and Lucy soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Lowndes soils contain hard white phosphates nodules in the profile.  Trep soils do not have skeletons of uncoated sand in the upper Bt horizons and have clayey lower Bt horizons.  Gomery and Tenaha soils have sola thinner than 60 inches and in addition, Gomery soils have Cr horizons.  Libert soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite in the Bt horizon.  Wolfpen soils have base saturation greater than 35 percent."

At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 45 inches and Thornthwaite P-E index is about 76.  The soils formed in unconsolidated loamy sediments.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 50 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E index exceeds 76."
