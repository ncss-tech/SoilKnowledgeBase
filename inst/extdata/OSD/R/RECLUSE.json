    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches in thickness.  Depth to horizons of continuous calcium carbonate accumulation and the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 16 to 30 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the Bk horizons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The soil is usually dry in the moisture control section when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or warmer.  The moisture control section is dry for 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days between July 15 and October 25 in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Structure is typically angular blocky but may be prismatic in some pedons.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 12 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  Calcium carbonate is disseminated and as seams and masses. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate is disseminated."

It is assumed the Asparas, Critchell, Dagflat, Datil, Hargreave, Harlan, Hiarc, Kirtley, Lavate, Loarc and Noden series are competing pending update of the classification.  Ascalon and Moskee soils have an argillic horizon averaging more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Bresser soils have loamy coarse sand or gravelly loamy sand at depths of 20 to 38 inches.  Asparas, Capulin, Datil and Wolf soils have calcic horizons at depths less than 40 inches.  Cedak, Dagflat, Hargreave, Hiarc, Kirtley and Ryegate soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Featherlegs soils have gravelly or cobbly material at depths of 30 to 40 inches.  Harlan and Sugardee have redder hue.  Critchell, Lavate and Noden soils lack free carbonates to a depth of 40 inches or more.  Loarc, Satanta and Shalona soils are not usually dry in the moisture control section for 90 or more cumulative days between July 15 and October 25.  Wages soils have secondary carbonates at a depth of 15 inches or less."
