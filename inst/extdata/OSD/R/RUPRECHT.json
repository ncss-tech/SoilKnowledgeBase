These soils are usually moist, and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties and 40 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  Organic matter is 5 to 10 percent.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 12 to 15 percent for air dried samples and 20 to 30 percent for moist samples.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Reaction is very strongly to  moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist.  It is extremely gravelly medial loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid."
