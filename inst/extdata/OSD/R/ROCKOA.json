  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockoa series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvial material weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale on uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.  Elevations range from about 2950 to 7000 feet.",

Many sandstone fragments ranging in size from coarse fragments up to boulders, about 12 feet in diameter are on the surface and mixed throughout the profile.  They range from 15 to 55 percent by volume in the solum and 40 to 70 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 and 1 or 2 moist.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam but some pedons are loam.  It contains 0 to 40 percent by volume of stones, boulders, and coarse fragments of rock.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam, but some pedons are loam.  It contains 25 to 40 percent stones and fragments of rock.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam but some pedons are sandy loam, or loam.  It contains 30 to 50 percent by volume of stones and fragments of rock.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It typically is sandy clay loam but some pedons are loam, clay loam or fine sandy loam and typically averages 18 to 30 percent clay.  It contains 35 to 60 percent by volume of stones and fragments of rock.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist; and chroma of 3 to 6.

It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It typically is fine sandy loam but some pedons are sandy clay loam or loam.  It contains 40 to 70 percent by volume of stones and fragments of rock.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Sandstone, shale or limestone is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

Abreu and Macmeal soils contain smaller fragments and formed in materials from igneous rocks. Grizzly soils have thicker combined E and B/E horizons and contain more than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Pactola soils contain more mica and formed in residuum from slate.  Mocmont soils have fragments of rock that are dominantly angular pebbles.  Tecolate soils receive more rainfall and formed in materials from felsite.  Vanocker soils have carbonates at depths above 20 inches.  Wahatoya soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Yourame soils have the base of the solum at depths greater than 60 inches."
