  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick. depth to calcareous material is 0 to 4 inches, and there is no bedrock or strongly contrasting substratum above 40 inches. The mollic epipedon contains .8 to 2 percent organic carbon which decreases uniformly with depth. Calcium carbonate equivalent, including coarse fragments less than 20 millimeters in diameter, exceeds 40 percent in the control section. The fine earth fraction in the control section is typically silty clay loam or silt loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 65 percent silt, and 10 to 60 percent sand. Coarse fragments range from 50 to 80 percent in the control section, and are mainly fine and very fine limestone gravel and thin flat fragments less than 6 inches in length. The average annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is 57 degrees F. without an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It usually has granular structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. It is soft to slightly hard and moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has pedons. It is soft to slightly hard and moderately to strongly alkaline. The C horizon has pedons. It is soft to slightly hard and moderately to strongly alkaline. The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It may have some secondary accumulated calcium carbonate principally as coating on the underside of the rock fragments. It is moderately to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on gently to steeply sloping alluvial fans and valley-filling sideslopes. Slope gradient ranges from 1 to 15 percent. These soils formed in very gravelly alluvial fan sediments derived principally from limestone bedrock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer months."
