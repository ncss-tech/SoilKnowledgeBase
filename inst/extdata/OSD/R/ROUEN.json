  "OVERVIEW": "The Rouen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on forested mountains.  They formed in colluvium from argillite with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
