  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Scribner and Sikeston series.  Scribner soils are on slightly higher positions and have a weighted average of organic matter content of 1 to 10 percent in the 25 to 100 centimeter (10 to 40 inch) zone, and do not have stratified horizons with more than 10 percent organic matter.  Sikeston soils have soil temperatures below 8 degrees C (47 degrees F) part of the year."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ryde soils are on nearly level river deltas and flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources that contain hydrophytic plant remains.  Elevations are 4.5 meters (15 feet) below sea level to 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level.  Levees and pumps are required to control both surface and subsurface water.  The climate is subhumid, mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 355 to 508 millimeters (14 to 20 inches).  Mean annual January temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F); the mean July temperature is 24 degrees C (76 degrees F); and the mean annual temperature is about 15 to 16 degrees C (60 to 61 degrees F).  The frost-free season is 260 to 280 days."

Kingile, Rindge, Shima and Venice are on lower positions and are all organic soils.  Valdez soils are on slightly higher positions, are fine-silty and have an ochric epipedon. Scribner soils are on slightly higher positions and do not contain stratified organic horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  Some pedons with organic or sandy substratum have rapid permeability below 40 inches.  The drainage of these soils has been altered by the use of levees and pumps.  Water tables occur between 91 to 122 centimeters (36 and 48 inches) throughout the year.  Flooding is rare due to protection by levees."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location has been moved from Solano County to San Joaquin County.  This revision includes the characteristics of the Retryde series which is dropped.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 61 centimeters (24 inches) (Ap,A).\nCumulic subgroup - mollic epipedon is 61 to 81 centimeters (24 to 32 inches) thick and has an irregular decrease of organic matter with increasing depth.\nThe base saturation of pedons with very strongly acid reactions needs to be checked.  The mucky loam and mucky silt loam surface texture need to be checked to see if they are in the Histic subgroup.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.  Competing series updated in 2016.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil was laboratory sampled as 14N0996 (S2014CA077001)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
