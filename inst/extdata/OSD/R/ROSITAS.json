  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carsitas (CA), Lagunita (AZ), Myoma (CA), and Pintobasin (CA) series. Carsitas soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments and are stratified. Lagunita soils are stratified, have an irregular decrease in organic carbon and are subject to flooding. Myoma soils have hue of 2.5Y or yellower throughout. Pintobasin soils are noneffervescent or very slightly effervescent in the particle-size control section and formed from mixed alluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rositas soils are on dunes and sand sheets. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in sandy eolian material.  Elevations are 270 feet below sea level to 2000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer. The mean annual precipitation is 0 to 8 inches. The mean January temperature is about 53 degrees F., mean July temperature is 92 degrees F., and the mean annual air temperature is 70 to 77 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 250 to 365 days."

Holtville soils are clayey in the upper part of the control section. Imperial soils are fine textured throughout the control section. Meloland soils are sandy loam in the upper part and fine in the lower part of the control section. Niland soils are fine textured in the lower part of the control section. Vint soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon."
