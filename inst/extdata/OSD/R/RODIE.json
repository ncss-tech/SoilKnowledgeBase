  "OVERVIEW": "The Rodie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Rodie soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
