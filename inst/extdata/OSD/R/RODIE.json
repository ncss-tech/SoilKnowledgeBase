    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rodie soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,505 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 75 to 95 days."
