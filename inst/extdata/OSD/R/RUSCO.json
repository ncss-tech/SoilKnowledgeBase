  "OVERVIEW": "The Rusco series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess or old alluvium.  These soils are typically in depressions on uplands or stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 58 centimeters (23 inches) at the type location.",
