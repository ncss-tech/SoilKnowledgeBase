  "OVERVIEW": "The Roseberry series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in material from coarse textured glacial outwash. Roseberry soils are on outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
