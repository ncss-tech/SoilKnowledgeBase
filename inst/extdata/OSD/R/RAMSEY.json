  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to sandstone or quartzite bedrock range from 7 to 20 inches.  Each horizon contains about 5 percent to 35 percent fragments of sandstone or quartzite except the surface layer can have less.  Fragments are mostly less than 3 inches in size in the upper part of the solum but some in the lower part are as much as 10 inches in size.  Reaction in each horizon is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 4.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.   The A and E horizons are loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  The fine earth texture is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a BC or C horizon with the same colors as the the Bw horizon.  The texture ranges from loam to loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Basehor series in the same family and the Hector series in a closely related family.  Basehor soils contain fewer fragments and lower annual precipitation. Hector soils have a thermic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ramsey soils are on the tops and upper side slopes of hills and mountains. Slopes range from 8 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and in some places contain colluvium from sandstone or quartzite.  Outcrops of bedrock are common. Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 55.5 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 54 inches."

All of the soils have sola thicker than 20 inches and are more than 20 inches to bedrock.  In addition, Bouldin, Grimsley, Hartsell, Jefferson, and Lily soils have argillic horizons."
