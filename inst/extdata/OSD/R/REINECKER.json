  "OVERVIEW": "The Reinecker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and/or conglomerate.  Reinecker soils are on mountain slopes or hills.  Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
