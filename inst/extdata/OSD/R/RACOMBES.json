  "OVERVIEW": "The Racombes series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in thick alkaline\nsediments.  These soils are on nearly level deltaic coastal\nterraces that have plane or concave surfaces.  Water runs off the surface at a slow or medium rate.  Slope is less than 1 percent.",

Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Electrical conductivity is 1 to 4 mmhos/cm in most pedons, but\nranges from 4 to 16 mmhos/cm in saline pedons.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish\nbrown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or dark gray\n(10YR 4/1).  It is loam or sandy clay loam with clay content\nranging from 16 to about 28 percent.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nWeighted average clay content of the Bt horizon ranges from 26 to\n34 percent.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Clay films\nare thin and patchy to nearly continuous on both horizontal and vertical surfaces of peds.  Structure is weak to moderate fine or medium blocky.  Weak to moderate medium or coarse prisms occur in some pedons.\nThe Bt1 horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark\ngrayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), dark gray\n(10YR 4/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark brown (10YR 4/3, 3/3),\nor brown (10YR 5/3).  It ranges from neutral to moderately\nalkaline.\nThe Bt2 horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3),\nor yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).  It is mildly alkaline or\nmoderately alkaline.\nThe Bw is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  In some pedons this horizon contains secondary calcium carbonate and is designated as a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon is light brown (7.5YR 6/4), pink (7.5YR 7/4),\nreddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6, 7/6), very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4, 8/4), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).
