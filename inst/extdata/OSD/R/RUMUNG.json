    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 7 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2, 3, or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is dominantly gravelly silt loam but ranges to gravelly clay loam, gravelly silty clay loam, or very gravelly silt loam.  By volume, the A horizon is 15 to 40 percent moderately hard and hard schist gravel .1 to 3 inches in size and 0 to 15 percent cobbles 3 to 6 inches in size.  Reaction in 1:1 water is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has moist color in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and is very gravelly.  The B horizon pebble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume and 3 to 6 inches in size.  Reaction in 1:1 water is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has moist color with hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 5G, value of 4, 5, or 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is extremely gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay.  By volume, the C horizon is 50 to 85 percent gravel 1 to 30 inches in size and 10 to 20 percent cobbles 3 to 6 inches in size.  Total coarse fragment content ranges from 60 to 90 percent by volume.  Reaction in 1:1 water is strongly acid through slightly acid."

The soils formed in uptilted hard and soft green, chlorite, or talc schist or volcanic breccia containing schist fragments.  Elevation ranges from 3 to 567 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 81 degrees F. and does not vary by more than 34 degrees F from month to month.  Mean annual maximum temperature is 88 degrees F. and mean annual minimum temperature is 75 degrees F.  Mean annual rainfall is about 122 inches (and presumably higher in the higher elevations) and varies from 90 to 149 inches from year to year, with the driest months of February, March, and April averaging 6 inches per month."
