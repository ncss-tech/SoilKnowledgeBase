  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rhinebeck series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey lacustrine sediments.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 72 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the surface layer, and from 0 to 10 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the A and E horizons, strongly acid through slightly alkaline in the B horizon, and slightly acid through moderately alkaline in the C and 2C horizons.\nAp or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons are gravelly. Structure is granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 1 through 3, and has redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or it is platy. Consistence ranges from very friable to firm.\nSome pedons have BE horizons that replace or underlie the E horizon. Colors are similar to E horizons in hue and value, but chroma 3 through 6 and they have redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bt or Btg horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 5Y or are neutral, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 1 through 4, and have redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam or silty clay, with subhorizons of silt loam or clay in some pedons. Structure is weak to strong, prismatic or subangular or angular blocky. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nSome pedons have BC horizons that underlie B horizons. They have similar color, texture, and structure to the B horizons, except some pedons have plate-like divisions inherited from the lacustrine parent material. BC horizons are calcareous or noncalcareous. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue of 5YR through 5Y or are neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with subhorizons, usually discontinuous, ranging to fine sand. They are massive or varved, or have very coarse prismatic structure in the upper part. Free carbonates are absent above a depth of 72 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Brockport, Caneadea, Churchville, Lockport, Odessa, and Remsen series are in the same family. Brockport and Lockport soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches. Caneadea soils have a solum thicker than 40 inches. Churchville soils have a lithologic discontinuity and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Odessa soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. Remsen soils formed in till and have a higher sand and rock fragment content in individual layers."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series has been reclassified from Epiaqualfs to Endoaqualfs. While the lacustrine material is fine textured and permeability is slowed, there is no limiting layer to roots or water.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 14 inches. (Ap horizon & E horizon)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 32 inches. (Bt1 & Bt2 horizons)\n3. Aqualf suborder - aquic conditions within 20 inches of surface (Eg, Bt1, & Bt2 horizons); redoximorphic features in all layers between 10 inches and 16 inches (Eg & Bt1 horizons); and masses of iron accumulation and faces of peds with chroma of 2 or less in the matrix. (Bt1 horizon)\n4. Aeric subgroup - as evidenced by matrix chroma greater than 2 in a layer within 30 inches - the zone from 14 to 23 inches. (Bt1 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
