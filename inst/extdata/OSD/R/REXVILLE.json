  "OVERVIEW": "The Rexville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Holocene age. These nearly level soils occur on flats on river and stream terraces on the coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
