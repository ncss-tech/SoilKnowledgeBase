  "OVERVIEW": "The Riz series is a member of the fine, montmorillonitic, thermic family of Typic Natrixeralfs.  Typically, Riz soils have pale brown and brown, mottled, neutral, silty clay loam A horizons, pale brown and yellowish brown, strongly and very strongly alkaline, silty clay B2t horizons, and light yellowish brown, calcareous, very strongly alkaline C horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 26 to about 40 inches measured to the base of the B2t horizons.  The mean annual soils temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 62 degrees to 65 degrees F.  Depth to lime ranges from 10 to 18 inches.  The soils are continuously dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches from late May or June until late October or early November.  They are moist all the rest of the time.  Soils used for growing rice have mottles in the A horizons and upper B2t horizons.  Soils not flooded for rice culture do not have mottles above 30 inches but may have mottles below 30 inches.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is heavy silty clay loam or clay and contains 5 to 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the average, and 35 to 45 percent clay.  This horizon has 15 to 25 percent sodium saturation in all parts.  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure in the upper part and subangular blocky or angular blocky structure in the lower part.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline and weakly to moderately calcareous."

Antioch, Las Flores, Placentia, San Miguel, and Stockpen soils have an abrupt AB2t horizon boundary with more than 15 percent clay increase.  Bonsall soils have a paralithic contact below the argillic horizon.  Lethent soils are moist during part of December, January, and February for less than 90 consecutive days and are dry the rest of the year.  Orestimba soils lack natric horizons and lack prismatic structure.  Pescadero soils have mottles and chroma of 1 or 2 within 20 inches of the surface.  Rossi soils have less than 35 percent clay in the natric horizon."

The soils formed in strongly calcareous silty sediments.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual rainfall is 15 to 25 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees to 62 degrees F., average January temperature is about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 78 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 250 to 280 days."
