  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruinpoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone. Ruinpoint soils are on mesas, alluvial flats on structural benches and structural benches. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
