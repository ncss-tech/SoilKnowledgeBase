  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact is 4 to 10 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F. at the lithic contact and remains above 47 degrees F. throughout the year. The soil is dry in most years in all parts from May 15 to October 11 moist in all parts from November 1 to April 1 and moist in some parts the rest of the year. Weighted average clay content of the control section is 12 to 25 percent, and average content of rock fragments is 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid in some part. Base saturation (by NH40AC) is greater than 60 percent in some part. High value and chroma root stains with hues of 7.5YR and 5YR are common throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 612, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6. Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/3 or 4/4. Texture is gravelly loam or very cobbly loam with 12 to 22 percent clay. Gravel content is 5 to 25 percent, cobble content is 5 to 30 percent and stone content is 2 to 5 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon is 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6 or 5YR 6/3. Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 5YR 4/4. Texture is very gravelly or very cobbly loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. Gravel content is 5 to 50 percent, cobble content is 10 to 30 percent, and stone content is 2 to 5 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. A very gravelly clay layer that is 0 to 1.5 inches thick and is forming in the underlying andesitic conglomerate is in the lower part of the Bw horizon.\nSome pedons have a C horizon."

Slopes are O to 15 percent. They formed in dark metamorphic and quartzitic gravelly and cobbly alluvium from mixed rock sources overlying unrelated andesitic tuffaceous conglomerate. Elevation ranges from 120 to 510 feet. Climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 77 degrees F; the mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 250 to 280 days."
