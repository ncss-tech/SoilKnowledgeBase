Slopes range form 3 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and alluvium from lacustrine deposits.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches and average annual temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 125 to 150 days."
