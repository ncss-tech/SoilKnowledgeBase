  "OVERVIEW": "The Ridott series consists of deep, poorly drained soils on gently rolling, loess covered, bedrock controlled uplands. They formed in 30 to 50 inches of loess and in the underlying residuum weathered from shale. Permeability is moderate in the loess and slow or very slow in the residuum. Slopes are 1 to 7 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.",

Ansgar soils formed in loess and the underlying till or till-derived sediments and contain more sand in the 2Btg\nhorizon. Coppock soils have a thicker E horizon and do not have a 2Bt horizon. Cory and Walford soils formed entirely in loess and do not have a 2Bt horizon. Newberry soils formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits that overlie a strongly developed paleosol in Illinoian till. They are more acid in the upper part of the Btg horizon. Loran soils have a mollic epipedon. Massbach soils have browner colors in the\ncontrol section."

The somewhat poorly drained Loran soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby, with slope gradients ranging from 0 to 12 percent. The well drained and moderately well drained Massbach,\nEleroy and Keltner soils are on similar and generally more sloping parts of the landscape nearby. Massbach soils form a drainage sequence with Ridott soils. Eleroy soils are Typic\nHapludalfs. Keltner soils are Typic Argiudolls. Calamine soils have thinner loess and have a mollic epipedon. They are in slightly depressed areas and on foot slopes where seepage occurs."
