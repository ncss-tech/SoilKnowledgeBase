  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 40 to 55 inches in thickness. The paralithic contact is at a depth between 40 and 60 inches. The loess mantle is 30 to 50 inches in thickness. The dominant clay mineral in the loess is montmorillonite and in the\nshale is illite.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, except eroded pedons include silty clay loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. It is medium acid to neutral. In some pedons it has been incorporated into the Ap horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is mottled with higher chroma. It is medium acid in some part, typically in\nthe upper part, and grades to neutral to moderately alkaline with increasing depth.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Mottles have chroma of 1 through 8. Clay films have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or are neutral; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 0 through 2. The 2Btg horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Some pedons exhibit rock structure or contain fragments of weathered shale. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons contain free carbonates.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, 5G, or is neutral; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 0 through 8. It is calcareous, noncalcareous, or nonacid shale. It is silty to\nclayey and contains variable amounts of hard rock fragments of shale, sandstone, or limestone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ansgar, Coppock, Cory, Newberry, and Walford series in the same family, and the Loran and Massbach serie. Ansgar soils formed in loess and the underlying till or till-derived sediments and contain more sand in the 2Btg\nhorizon. Coppock soils have a thicker E horizon and do not have a 2Bt horizon. Cory and Walford soils formed entirely in loess and do not have a 2Bt horizon. Newberry soils formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits that overlie a strongly developed paleosol in Illinoian till. They are more acid in the upper part of the Btg horizon. Loran soils have a mollic epipedon. Massbach soils have browner colors in the\ncontrol section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ridott soils are on gently rolling ridges and side slopes of loess covered, bedrock controlled uplands. Slope gradients are 1 to 7 percent. Ridott soils formed in 30 to 50 inches of loess and in the underlying residuum weathered from shale. Mean annual temperature varies from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 32 to 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Loran and Massbach soils and the Calamine, Keltner, and Eleroy soils. The somewhat poorly drained Loran soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby, with slope gradients ranging from 0 to 12 percent. The well drained and moderately well drained Massbach,\nEleroy and Keltner soils are on similar and generally more sloping parts of the landscape nearby. Massbach soils form a drainage sequence with Ridott soils. Eleroy soils are Typic\nHapludalfs. Keltner soils are Typic Argiudolls. Calamine soils have thinner loess and have a mollic epipedon. They are in slightly depressed areas and on foot slopes where seepage occurs."
