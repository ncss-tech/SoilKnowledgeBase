  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates typically is about 4 to 10 inches, but some pedons have carbonates to the surface.  The mollic epipedon typically is more than 30 inches thick, but ranges from 20 to 50 inches in thickness.  Where uncultivated, the combined A and E horizon thickness is less than 5 inches.  The soil ranges from slightly acid in the upper part to strongly alkaline in the lower part.\nSome pedons have an A horizon up to 21 inches thick.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is loam, silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon up to 9 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is clay or silty clay averaging 50 to 60 percent clay, but ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay.  Some pedons have a Btnz, Bk or Bkz horizon.\nThe Bg and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or are neutral, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.  Where chroma is 2 or 3, the hue is either 5Y or the soil has mottles with chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is silty clay or clay averaging between 45 and 60 percent clay, but some is silty clay loam.  Salt crystals and carbonate accumulations are in the C horizon in most pedons.  Coarser-textured sediments are in some pedons at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Harriet and Ranslo series as previously classified and the Heil series.  Harriet soils average 35 to 50 percent clay in the Btn horizon and formed in stratified alluvium.  Ranslo soils have combined A and E horizon thickness of more than 5 inches, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Heil soils are deeper than 12 inches to salts or carbonates and they are absent in the A, E and upper Btn horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ryan soils are on level stream terraces and glacial lake plains with slope gradients of 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in alkaline clayey sediments.  The climate is cool, subhumid, with long cold winters and short warm summers.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F, and the annual precipitation from 15 to 23 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Aberdeen and Exline soils are on nearby areas where sediments contain more silt.  They are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained, respectively.  None of the other associated soils have natric horizons.  In addition, Fairdale and La Prairie soils contain less than 35 percent clay and Lamoure soils are fine-silty.  Enloe, Fargo, Hegne and Ludden soils are on the same lake plain.  Fairdale, La Prairie and Wahpeton soils are on better drained sites on floodplains.  Lamoure soils are on similar positions on floodplains."

A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 0.5 foot above the surface to 1.5 foot below the surface at some time during the period of March through July."
