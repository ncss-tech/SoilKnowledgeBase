Celeridge soils are derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite have a mollic thickness of 36 to 50 cm, and have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Gabica soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Genoa soils formed in residuum weathered from granitic and some metamorphic rocks. Gerdog soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 17 to 19 degrees C. Gidwin soils have a mollic epipedon thickness of 36 to 50 cm.  Grandeposit soils formed in colluvium over residuum from quartzite and slate. . Hawkridge soils are dominated by gravel and average 14 to 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Hutchley soils have a mollic epipedon that is 25 to 50 cm thick. Loope soils have 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Mattier soils are 25 to 36 cm deep to a lithic contact and contains 10 to 20 percent volcanic glass. Melling soils formed in colluvium and residuum from intermediate and basic igneous rock. Pernog soils have a mollic epipedon that is 30 to 50 cm thick. Rozara soils have 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Shalcleav soils average 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section which are mainly channers and flagstones. Tweener soils have an argillic horizon that is 8 to 15 cm thick."
