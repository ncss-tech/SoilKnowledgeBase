  "OVERVIEW": "The Ragged series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium mixed with glacial drift and minor amounts of volcanic ash on debris cones, terraces, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,100 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
