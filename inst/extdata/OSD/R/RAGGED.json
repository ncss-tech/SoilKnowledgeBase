  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ragged soils are on debris cones, terraces, and alluvial fans at elevations of 380 to 700 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium mixed with glacial drift and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  The climate is mild; with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,500 to 2,540 millimeters and mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 10 degrees C. Frost free season is 60 to 90 days."
