The mean summer soil temperature is 63 to 69 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is heavy clay loam or light clay and has 35 to 45 percent clay in the lower part.\nThe B3ca horizon, or upper part of the C horizon, contains 25 to 35 percent gravel.  The IIC horizon contains 60 to 75 percent gravel.  It is very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand."

The soils formed in alluvium underlain by very gravelly loamy sand material. The climate is cool, dry-semiarid, and continental with cold dry winters and moist springs.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, most of which usually falls during spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.   Mean summer temperature is 64 to 71 degrees F. The freeze-free (32 degree F.) growing season is 110 to 130 days."
