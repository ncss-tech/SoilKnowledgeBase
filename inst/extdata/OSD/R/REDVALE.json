The soils formed in alluvium underlain by very gravelly loamy sand material. The climate is cool, dry-semiarid, and continental with cold dry winters and moist springs.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, most of which usually falls during spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.   Mean summer temperature is 64 to 71 degrees F. The freeze-free (32 degree F.) growing season is 110 to 130 days."
