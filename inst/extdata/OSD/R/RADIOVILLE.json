Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 466 meters (600 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy sediments and moderately low or low in the lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderate in the loamy sediments and slow or very slow in the lacustrine sediments."
