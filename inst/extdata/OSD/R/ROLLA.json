  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 40 inches from the mineral soil surface. The profile is clay or silty clay throughout with greater than 60 percent clay in the control section. It is free of rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 2 to 5 dry and chroma of 1.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have Ap horizon 7 to 10 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 4 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 or 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. Chromas of 3 are allowed in the lower part. It has 60 to 70 percent clay. The Bt horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have Btk or BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rolla soils are on level to rolling upland collapsed glacial lake plains. The slope gradient commonly is 0 to 5 percent, but the range is 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed under forest vegetation in calcareous clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 21 to 27 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer. Frost-free period ranges from 100 to 120 days and elevation ranges from 1070 feet (325 meters) to 2525 feet (770 meters)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eramosh, Kelvin, and Metigoshe soils. Eramosh soils are in fens and are ponded during part of the growing season. Kelvin soils formed in nearby glacial till. Metigoshe soils have more and sand and less clay in the control section and have underlying layers of sand and gravel. They are on nearby collapsed outwash plains."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have been cleared and the soils are used for crops, pasture, or hay; small grains are the principal crop and alfalfa is important. The native vegetation consists of noncommercial stands of aspen, birch, oak and ash with an understory of shrubs. These areas are used for woodland pasture or wildlife habitat."
