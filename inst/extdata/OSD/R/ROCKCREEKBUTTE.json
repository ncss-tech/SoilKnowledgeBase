  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockcreekbutte series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on backslopes of mountains.  Rockcreekbutte soils formed in colluvium from granite with volcanic ash mixed in surface horizons. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
