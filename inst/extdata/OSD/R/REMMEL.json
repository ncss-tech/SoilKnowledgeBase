The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to loamy coarse sand textures ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 2 to 6 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.
