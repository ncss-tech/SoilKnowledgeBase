The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation ranges from 30 to 75 percent (sum) throughout the profile, but is greater than 35 percent 1.25 meters below the top of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; or 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/2 or 4/4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.

Cotati and Spreckels soils have mesic soil temperatures.  Forbesville soils have an abrupt textural increase of clay between the surface and the top of the argillic of 20 percent (absolute) within a vertical distance of 7.5 cm. Pinnacles soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Red Bluff and Spreckles series have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Hellman soils have moist color values less than 3.5 throughout the upper 10 cm.  Manzanita soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections."
