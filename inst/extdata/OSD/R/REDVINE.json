  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and the depth to old alluvium is greater than 60 inches.  The soil is dry between a depth of 7 to 20 inches in all parts from June to October in most years and usually moist in all parts from December to May.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation ranges from 30 to 75 percent (sum) throughout the profile, but is greater than 35 percent 1.25 meters below the top of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; or 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/2 or 4/4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5YR 3/6, 4/6; 5YR 3/6, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/6.

Cotati and Spreckels soils have mesic soil temperatures.  Forbesville soils have an abrupt textural increase of clay between the surface and the top of the argillic of 20 percent (absolute) within a vertical distance of 7.5 cm. Pinnacles soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Red Bluff and Spreckles series have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Hellman soils have moist color values less than 3.5 throughout the upper 10 cm.  Manzanita soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Redvine soils are on dissected terraces and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  They formed in old alluvium from sedimentary rock at elevations of 500 to 1,400 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 32 to 44 inches.  Mean January temperature is 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 57 to 59 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges from 200 to 225 days."
