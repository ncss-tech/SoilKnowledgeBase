  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rana series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from shale.  Rana soils are on basalt mesa breaks underlain by shale.  Slope is 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
