  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Romberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Romberg soils are in canyons and on hills, structural benches, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 6 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
