They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from Tertiary granitic sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Delvalle soils are coarse-loamy, have B horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates, and occur on treads of high stream terraces.  Devargas soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have argillic horizons, and occur on treads of high stream terraces."
