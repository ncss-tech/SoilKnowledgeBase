    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bluegrass, Crider, Hootentown, Navilleton, Peridge, Stinesville and Winnipeg series. Bluegrass soils have medium or high phosphate content in the series control section. Crider soils average less than 10 percent sand in all parts of the argillic horizon. Hootentown soils average less than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Navilleton soils have slower permeability in the lower part of the series control section. Peridge soils have hue of redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Stinesville soils do not have rock fragments above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ryker soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of dissected till plains and in sinkholes (karst landscapes). Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Ryker soils formed in loess and the underlying drift and residuum from limestone. The drift is considered to be from the Illinoian or Kansan stage. Indurated limestone bedrock is typically within a depth of 4 meters (12 feet). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days."

The moderately deep Caneyville soils are on typically on the lower part of backslopes of hills. The well drained, less permeable Cincinnati and moderately well drained Nabb soils are on slightly higher lying summits, shoulders and backslopes of till plains. The well drained, deep Grayford soils are on similar shoulder and backslope positions as Ryker soils, and are often complexes with Ryker soils. The moderately well drained, less permeable Muscatatuck soils are on similar landform positions as Ryker soils. The well drained, more silty Stinesville soils are on similar landform positions as Ryker soils."
