  "OVERVIEW": "The Ryker series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in loess and the underlying drift and residuum from limestone. These soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

Ryker soils formed in loess and the underlying drift and residuum from limestone. The drift is considered to be from the Illinoian or Kansan stage. Indurated limestone bedrock is typically within a depth of 4 meters (12 feet). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days."

The well drained, deep Grayford soils are on similar shoulder and backslope positions as Ryker soils, and are often complexes with Ryker soils. The moderately well drained, less permeable Muscatatuck soils are on similar landform positions as Ryker soils. The well drained, more silty Stinesville soils are on similar landform positions as Ryker soils."
