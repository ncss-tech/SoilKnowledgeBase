  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is estimated to range from 41 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to very gravelly material is primarily of gravel, less than 20 inches.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5.5 to 6.5 dry, 3.5 to 4.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from loam to silt loam.  Moderately gravelly phases are common, but nongravelly, very gravelly, moderately cobbly, very cobbly, and stony phases are recognized.  The C horizon is about one Munsell chip brighter in chroma or one chip lighter in value than the A horizon, and has an increase in carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations range from about 5,000 to 6,700 feet.  The soil formed mostly in local alluvium from limestone sources.  The average summer temperature ranges from 62 to 66 degrees F.  The freeze-free period ranges from 94 to 108 days, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches, and is fairly evenly distributed except for a slight maximum in May and June."

Bereniceton and Gallagher soils are noncarbonatic and are more than 20 inches deep over gravel.  McCaleb and Waddoups soils are deeper than 26 inches to gravel.  Also, Wadodups soils have color value less than 5.5 when dry and 3.5 when moist.  Soelberg soils have a mollic epipedon and a weak Bt horizon."
