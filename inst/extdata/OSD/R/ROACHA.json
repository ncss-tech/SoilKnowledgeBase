Cranegulch (MLRA 10) on foothills, Maple Hollow (MLRA 28A) on alluvial fans, Midvale (MLRA 10) on terraces, and Ramo (MLRA 9, 43) on footslopes soils are very deep. Daphnedale soils (MLRA 21) are on terraces and have a paralithic contact composed of soft sedimentary tuff with slopes of 2 to 50 percent that have 46 to 50 degrees F. mean annual soil temperature. Keating soils (MLRA 10) are on hills and have a lithic contact of fractured greenstone. Widmer soils (MLRA 21) are on plateaus and formed in residuum derived from basalt with hard basalt within 60 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series was classified as fine, mixed, mesic Typic Haploxerolls when it was proposed in 1986. Subsequent work supported an argillic horizon and smectitic mineralogy. The pH was determined by colorimetric method using Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators. Texture determined by hydrometer method. Presence of carbonate determined by 10 percent HCL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
