Some pedons have a few  redoximorphic depletion masses in shades of brown in the Bt1 horizon and in the Bt2 horizon have few to many coarse, medium, or fine distinct  redoximorphic depletion masses in shades of gray, or brown.

Cupco soils are somewhat poorly drained, have chroma of 1 or 2 as coatings on faces of peds, have water table within 0.5 feet of the surface, and are on slightly lower or concave areas.  Dela and Ochlocknee soils have a coarse-loamy control section, lack Bt horizons and are on adjacent areas.  Frizzell soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a coarse-silty control section, and are on slightly higher areas.  Guyton soils are poorly drained, have chroma of 1 or 2 as coatings on faces of peds, have tongues of E horizon extending into the Bt horizon, and are on slightly lower or concave areas.  Neff soils are on slightly lower or concave areas.  Pushmataha soils are somewhat poorly drained, lack Bt horizons, have a coarse-silty control section, and are on slightly lower or concave areas.  Speer soils are on higher areas farther from the stream channel."
