  "OVERVIEW": "The Ringle series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Ringle soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderate in the surface and rapid in the substratum.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
