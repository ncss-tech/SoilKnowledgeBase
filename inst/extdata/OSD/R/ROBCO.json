Additional data has shown that the area mapped as Robco soils typically have a clay content of 30 to 35 percent.  These soils have slow permeability.  In 1988, it was changed to fine-loamy family.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in) (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon: 38 to 71 cm (15 to 28 in)\nArenic feature: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in), loamy fine sand texture.\nArgillic horizon: 71 to 208 cm (28 to 82 in) (Bt/E, Btg1, and Btg2 and BCt horizons)\nReduced matrix: 84 to 165 cm (33 to 65 in) (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations:  84 to 165 cm (33 to 65 in) (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less: 38 to 71 cm (15 to 28 in). (E horizons)\nEpisaturation: The zone of saturation at 69 to 119 cm (27 to 65 in) (Btg1, and Btg2 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Base saturation by hach Kit was 50 percent at 127 cm (50 in) below top of the argillic horizon at the type location, 91 percent at another location in Robertson County, and 77 percent from a pedon in Leon County, Texas.
