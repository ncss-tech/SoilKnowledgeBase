  "OVERVIEW": "The Robco series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 978 mm (38.5 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.2 degrees C (66.6 degrees F).",
