  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy outwash ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Some pedons have a silty mantle less than 12 inches thick.  Volume of gravel is typically less than 15 percent in the upper part of the loamy mantle, but ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout the loamy mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash, but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nSome uncultivated pedons have an O horizon of partially decomposed forest litter.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Value is greater than 5.5 dry.  Some uncultivated pedons have a 1 to 4 inch thick A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Some pedons do not have an A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs or it is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 , and chroma of 4.  It is sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nRosholt soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color like the E horizon described above.  It is typically fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is typically fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.  In some pedons, the upper part of the glossic horizon is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color like the Bt part described above.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is typically stratified layers of sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alban, Amery, Arland, Kennan, Langlade, Marathon, Mcginn, Santiago, and Scoba series.  A similar soil is the Padus series.  Alban soils have stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine deposits within 40 inches and do not have coarse fragments.  Amery and Kennan soils do not average more than 85 percent sand within 40 inches. Langlade soils are more than 40 inches thick to sandy outwash with more than 85 percent sand.  Marathon soils have a mantle, 15 to 35 inches thick, with more than 50 percent silt and are underlain by disintegrated granitic rock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Mcginn soils have a 14 to 20 inch thick sandy mantle over loamy glacial till and have free carbonates within 40 inches.  Santiago soils have a mantle, 12 to 36 inches thick, with more than 50 percent silt and do not average more than 85 percent sand in the fine earth fraction within 40 inches.  Scoba soils have redox accumulations and a zone of near saturation in the subsoil.  Padus soils have a spodic horizon.  Arland soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rosholt soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, eskers, and kames.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 45 percent.  These soils formed mostly in loamy alluvial deposits underlain by stratified sandy outwash.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,950 feet."

Chetek soils occupy landscape positions similar to those of Rosholt soils where the loamy mantle is 12 to 20 inches thick.  Kennan soils are on adjacent glacial moraines and drumlins.  The somewhat poorly drained Oesterle soils and the moderately well drained Scott Lake soils form a drainage sequence with Rosholt soils.  The moderately well drained Scoba soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Rosholt soils where there is a zone of near saturation with redox accumulations above the sandy outwash."
