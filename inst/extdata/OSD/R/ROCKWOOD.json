  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy lodgment till of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  These soils are on convex slopes on shoulders, summits, and backslopes of drumlins and moraines.  These soils are deep to a densic contact.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 680 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
