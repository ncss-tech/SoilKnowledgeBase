  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the coal ash materials is generally more than 1.6 meters thick. Carboliths range from 5 to 75 percent. Gravel-sized pieces of burned slag range from 10 to 75 percent. The pieces are very porous and glassy, similar to volcanic materials. Rock fragments in individual horizons may range up to 40 percent, however the weighted average in the control section is less than 35 percent. The fine-earth fraction includes smaller pieces of coal and slag, and the textures include loamy sand or coarser, though thin horizons of sandy loam material may occur. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Consistence is loose throughout. The only structure is the very fine aggregates in the rhizospheres. Colors are hue of N/, or 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 8.\nThe ^Au horizon may be defined more on the abundance of roots than anything else. Organic carbon accumulation would be difficult to identify by morphology.\nA thin organic layer may occur above the ^Au horizon.\nThe ^Cu horizons have distinctly fewer roots than the Au horizon, but otherwise look similar. Rooting depth is generally about one meter."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Riker soils are on nearly level to steep anthropogenic features such as coal ash piles, railroad yards, and other fill areas. These soils formed in a mixture of coal slag, unburned coal fragments, and large pieces of coal.  These materials were occasionally deposited as railroad track ballast. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees Celsius."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are generally densely covered with mugwort, Golden Rod, Black locust, Ailanthus, and Japanese knotweed. Secondary successional species include black cherry, sweetgum, aspen, birch, and Virginia creeper. Reclamation is unlikely because there is no natural vegetation to restore, and the areas vegetate naturally after deposition ceases. Recreational use is likely but is limited to uses that do not require turf establishment."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\na.\tCarbolith is a name coined at West Virginia University to describe dark colored sedimentary rocks that will make a black or very dark (Munsell color value of 3 or less) streak or powder. Rocks under this name include coal not scheduled for mining, impure waste coal, bone coal, high carbon siltstones, and high carbon shales.\nb.\t Coal ash supplies accumulated over more than one hundred years of time when hard coal was the main source of heating and producer of heat for production of electricity. The material often contains debris tossed into furnaces during burning. Areas used as railroad beds contain buried railroad ties and large pieces of coal used as ballast.\nc.\tIn coal slag horizons, the carbon content is from these materials and should not have a mucky modifier. Carbon contents are not related to organic material deposition.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.\tOchric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 7.5 centimeters.\nb.\tRock fragments of carboliths make up less than one-fourth of the total rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Coal slag makes up the rest of the coarse fragments. The combination averages more than 35 percent by volume.\nRikers soils are mapped in the soil survey areas of the Bronx River Watershed Bronx County NY, Gateway National Recreation Area and the New York City Reconnaissance Soil Survey, as well as the initial survey areas of Bronx, Kings, Queens, and Richmond Counties NY.  The soils are of minimal extent (less than 1,000 acres); however they are of unique importance to users of the soil surveys.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data for sample no. S95NY085007. Pedon analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE. Additional pedons include 08NY005-011 and S09NY085-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
