Clay percentage averages 5 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has color value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is very fine sandy loam or loam, but the range includes fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Eroded pedons commonly do not have an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  In some places, it contains thin strata of finer texture.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon consists of thin strata of sandstone, siltstone, and shale, with sandstone the dominant material."

Gorin soils formed in loess and pedisediment and are on narrow rounded ridgetops.  Keswick soils formed in a Sangamon paleosol and are on narrow rounded summits and upper side slopes.  Winnegan and Lindley soils formed in glacial till and are above the Reger soils on similar slopes."
