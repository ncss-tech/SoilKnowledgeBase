  "OVERVIEW": "The Realitos series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils are in upland depressions and formed in clayey over loamy alluvium derived from the Goliad Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).",
