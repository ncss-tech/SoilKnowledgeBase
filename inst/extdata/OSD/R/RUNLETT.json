  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Runlett series consists of moderately deep. well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived mostly from limestone, sandstone, and shale.  Runlett soils are on mesas, mountain slopes, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
