  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roseland soils are on convex ridgetops and side slopes of the uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in loamy residuum from acid shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 60 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 42 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Barco and the Deepwater and Hartwell soils.  Barco soils commonly are higher on the slope.  Deepwater and Hartwell soils have thicker sola and argillic horizons.  Deepwater soils commonly are higher on the slope, but may be in similar positions.  Hartwell soils are on nearly level and gently sloping positions."
