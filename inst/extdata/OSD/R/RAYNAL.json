Bear Lake and Lago soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Bern soils are moderately well drained and have calcic horizons. Thomasfork soils have a fine, montmorillonitic particle-size control section and cracks greater than 1/2 inch wide in the upper twenty inches of the profile. Bear Lake soils are on floodplains and in meander channels on positions below Raynal soils. Bern soils are on stream terraces above Raynal soils. Lago soils are in slightly lower positions than the Raynal soil. Thomasfork soils are on similar positions to Raynal soils but are located more towards the middle of the valley when associated with Raynal."
