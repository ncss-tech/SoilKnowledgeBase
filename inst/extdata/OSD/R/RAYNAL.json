  "OVERVIEW": "The Raynal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on stream terraces and flood plains. They formed in mixed alluvium. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Thomasfork soils have a fine, montmorillonitic particle-size control section and cracks greater than 1/2 inch wide in the upper twenty inches of the profile. Bear Lake soils are on floodplains and in meander channels on positions below Raynal soils. Bern soils are on stream terraces above Raynal soils. Lago soils are in slightly lower positions than the Raynal soil. Thomasfork soils are on similar positions to Raynal soils but are located more towards the middle of the valley when associated with Raynal."
