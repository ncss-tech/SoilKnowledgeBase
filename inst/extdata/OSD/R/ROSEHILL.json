  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosehill series consists of moderately deep to clayey shales, well drained soils formed in clayey residuum weathered from shale.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.)  Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches) at the type location.",
