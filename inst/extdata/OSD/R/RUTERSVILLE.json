  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.  Classification change from Typic Albaqualfs is the result of interpretation that low chroma matrix is due, in part, to lithochromic influences.  Field observations, landscape position and climate indicate the whole soil is typically not saturated throughout.  These soils have formerly been included in the Chazos, Straber and a variant of the Falba series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAquic feature - Presence of chromas of 2 or less below the Ap.\nOchric epipedon - from surface to 14 inches. (Ap and E horizons)\nAbrupt texture change at 14 inches.\nArgillic horizon - 14 to 42 inches. (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nParalithic contact at 54 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: A complete characterization report was provided by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Soil Characterization Laboratory from a 1987 pit study in Fayette County. Limited characterization data in a report to LCRA, \"Comparison of Physical and Chemical Properties and Production Capacity of Overburden and Land-Surface Soils from Proposed Mine Site, Fayette County, Texas\".
