Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A and E horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3.  texture is loamy fine sand or loamy very fine sand. The A and E horizons are very strongly acid to neutral and combined thickness is 8 to 20 inches.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3.  They have common to many, fine or medium, yellowish, brownish, and reddish mottles.  The amount of mottling throughout the B horizons decreases in abundance and size with depth.\nThe Bt1 textures are sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay or clay with clay content of 35 to 45 percent.  The Bt2 textures are fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam with clay content of 20 to 27 percent. Reaction of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt3 and BC horizons are fine sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam, with clay content of 15 to 25 percent.  A few small concretions of calcium carbonate and white salts are present in some pedons.  Reaction of the Bt3 and BC horizons range from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly to strongly cemented sandstone. Some pedons contain thin lenses and pockets of tuffaceous shale. The cemented sandstone is fractured.  The fractures contain masses of roots and organic stains.  A few concretions of calcium carbonate and white salts are present in some pedons.  Reaction of the Cr horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.  Classification change from Typic Albaqualfs is the result of interpretation that low chroma matrix is due, in part, to lithochromic influences.  Field observations, landscape position and climate indicate the whole soil is typically not saturated throughout.  These soils have formerly been included in the Chazos, Straber and a variant of the Falba series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAquic feature - Presence of chromas of 2 or less below the Ap.\nOchric epipedon - from surface to 14 inches. (Ap and E horizons)\nAbrupt texture change at 14 inches.\nArgillic horizon - 14 to 42 inches. (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nParalithic contact at 54 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: A complete characterization report was provided by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Soil Characterization Laboratory from a 1987 pit study in Fayette County. Limited characterization data in a report to LCRA, \"Comparison of Physical and Chemical Properties and Production Capacity of Overburden and Land-Surface Soils from Proposed Mine Site, Fayette County, Texas\". Texas Tech University.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
