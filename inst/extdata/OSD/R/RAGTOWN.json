  "OVERVIEW": "The Ragtown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Ragtown soils are on lake plains and basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
