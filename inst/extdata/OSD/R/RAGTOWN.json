  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ragtown soils are on lake plains and basin-floor remnants. They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,190 to 1,950 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Appian soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, well drained, and have natric horizons. Churchill soils are fine, moderately well drained, and have natric horizons.  Dithod soils are coarse-loamy and have mollic epipedons.  East Fork soils are fine-loamy, somewhat poorly drained, and have mollic epipedons."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Temporary perched water tables can occur above the lacustrine materials following irrigation. Endosaturation is present with a perched high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from April through October.  Flooding frequencies are typically none or rare, but a frequently flooded phase is recognized."
