  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy C horizons and depth to the loamy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Free carbonates are lacking in horizons in the upper sediment in some pedons.  In other pedons, they are in some to many parts but not all parts of the 10- to 20-inch depth zone.  The coarse fragments are mostly limestone, but a few are sandstone, shale, or igneous rocks.  These soils are saturated with water during at least part of the growing season.\nThe C horizon in the upper sediment has dominant value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1, but it has subhorizons with value as high as 5 and chroma as high as 2.  It has few through many mottles.  It is mostly loam or silt loam but it has coarser textured subhorizons in some pedons.  It has as much as 35 percent coarse fragments in some pedons.  It has weak or moderate, platy, granular, or subangular blocky structure or it is massive.  It is friable or very friable.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has few through many mottles.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has 35 to 90 percent of coarse fragments with channers commonly being dominant.  It also contains pebbles and cobblestones in varying amounts.  It has thin sandy or sandy-skeletal subhorizons in some pedons.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

Most areas are no more than 500 feet wide.  Relative relief in their area of occurrence ranges from 100 to 400 feet.  These soils formed in recent alluvium from glacial sediments, loess, and sedimentary bedrock.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 32 inches."
