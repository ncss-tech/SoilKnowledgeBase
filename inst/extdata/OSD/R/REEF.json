  "OVERVIEW": "The Reef series consist of very shallow and shallow somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils on hillslopes, canyon sideslopes, mountain slopes, ridge tops, structural benches, mesas, and cuestas. They formed in alluvium, residuum and colluvium from sandstone. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 10 inches.",

Andanada, Nonip, Skos, Sunup, and Teesto soils' clay content is greater than 18 percent. Ednagrey and Daklos soils have a hue of 10YR. Meriwhitica soils have a visible secondary calcium carbonate. Windcomb soils average less than 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the profile. Redsun and Windcomb soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Hillburn soils are inactive."
