Andanada, Nonip, Skos, Sunup, and Teesto soils' clay content is greater than 18 percent. Ednagrey and Daklos soils have a hue of 10YR. Meriwhitica soils have a visible secondary calcium carbonate. Windcomb soils average less than 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the profile. Redsun and Windcomb soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Hillburn soils are inactive."

Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in alluvium, residuum, and colluvium from limestone, siltstone, or sandstone of the Timpoweap member of the Moekopie formation. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches. The wettest month is August and the driest month is June. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days."
