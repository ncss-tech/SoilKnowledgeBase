  "OVERVIEW": "The Ridenbaugh series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed on loess or silty alluvium. Ridenbaugh soils are on old alluvial plains and low alluvial terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
