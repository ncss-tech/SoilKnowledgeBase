The soils formed in a veneer of loess or silty alluvium underlain by coarse alluvium. The climate is middle-latitude steppe (Trewartha's modified Koppen system) with cool wet winters and dry summers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches. Mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees to 53 degrees F. Frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
