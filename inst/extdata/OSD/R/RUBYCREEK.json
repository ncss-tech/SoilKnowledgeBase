  "OVERVIEW": "The Rubycreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, footslopes, and ridgetops.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist rocks with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid below.  Slope ranges from 2 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",
