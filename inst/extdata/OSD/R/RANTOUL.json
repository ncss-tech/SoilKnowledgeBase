The mollic epipedon extends to a depth of 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 inches) and commonly includes the upper part of the Bg horizon. The upper 51 cm (20 inches) or more has a COLE value greater than 0.09. The particle-size control section averages between 45 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. The texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 or 1 and ranging to chroma of 2 in the lower part. Redoximorphic features with higher chroma are commonly present. Texture is silty clay or clay. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, and in some pedons is stratified with thin layers of silt loam below 102 cm (40 inches). Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, and is stratified in some pedons. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The Cg horizon contains carbonates."

Chehalem soils are more acid in the lower part of the series control section. Clamo soils have carbonates within a depth of 76 cm (30 inches). Derrynane, Okoboji, Peotone, and Shiloh soils average less than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Southbrook soils average more than 50 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Wabash and Zook soils have mollic epipedons that are more than 76 cm (36 inches) thick. Zoe soils have a sodium adsorption ratio of 4 to 10 within a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) and have carbonates within a depth of 61 cm (24 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rantoul soils are in depressions in nearly level to rolling till plains and glacial lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. These soils formed in sediments from surrounding slopes and till or lakebed sediments. Mineralogy is thought to be smectitic although surrounding sloping areas are formed partly in material high in illite. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1020 mm (35 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 165 to 290 meters (540 to 950 feet) above sea level."

Where drained, the depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low (0.14 to 0.42 micrometers per second). Permeability is very slow."

    "content": "REMARKS: The mineralogy is questioned as to being mixed since the analysis of Rantoul shows it to be marginally smectitic, but the materials from which associated, better drained soils formed are illitic in mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon 0 to 66 cm (0 to 26 inches) (Ap, A, and Bg1 horizons); cambic horizon 43 to 152 cm (17 to 60 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, Bg4, and BCg horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
