  "OVERVIEW": "The Rantoul series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on nearly level or depressional parts of uplands. They formed in sediments from surrounding slopes and till or lakebed sediments. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 inches).",

These soils formed in sediments from surrounding slopes and till or lakebed sediments. Mineralogy is thought to be smectitic although surrounding sloping areas are formed partly in material high in illite. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1020 mm (35 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 165 to 290 meters (540 to 950 feet) above sea level."

Where drained, the depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low (0.14 to 0.42 micrometers per second). Permeability is very slow."
