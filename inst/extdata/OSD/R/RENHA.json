  "OVERVIEW": "The Renha series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain benches, shoulders, and footslopes at elevation of 2,300 to 3,800 feet.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone, marble, and dolomite with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 0 to 40 0percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.   Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 20 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 15 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2E/Bt horizon may be gravelly.  It is 2 to 15 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Some pedons have a 2E horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 6 moist.  It is clay or clay loam with 5 to 15 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline."
