Volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology averages from 10 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section with some profiles having thin layers containing up to 50 percent.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days for the 120 days following the summer solstice.  It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  An AC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand or gravelly sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.

They formed in sandy glaciolacustrine and outwash sediments.  These sediments are of late Wisconsin in age.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches.  The frost-free period ranges from 110 to 135 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 750 to 1350 feet."

Very poorly drained Deerwood soils are in depressions.  Poorly drained Hamar, Hangaard and Rosewood soils are in lower lying positions.  Sandberg soils are somewhat excessively drained and are on higher lying positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 19 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); oxyaquic subgroup criteria - redoximorphic features within 40 inches of the soil surface; sandy family - less than 35 percent rock fragments greater than 2mm by volume.\nFormerly correlated as a moderately wet phase of Lohnes.\nThe classification was changed to the Oxyaquic subgroup even though the morphology of this pedon may meet the Aquic subgroup criteria because it was felt Oxyaquic better fit the water state of the series.  A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series.  01/2000.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
