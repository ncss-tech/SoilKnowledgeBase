  "OVERVIEW": "The Radium series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy glaciolacustrine and outwash sediments on glacial lake beaches and outwash plains.  They have rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days for the 120 days following the summer solstice.  It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  An AC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand or gravelly sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 1 meter of the surface.  It is sand, loamy sand, coarse sand or loamy coarse sand in the fine earth fraction averaging between 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Very poorly drained Deerwood soils are in depressions.  Poorly drained Hamar, Hangaard and Rosewood soils are in lower lying positions.  Sandberg soils are somewhat excessively drained and are on higher lying positions."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 19 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); oxyaquic subgroup criteria - redoximorphic features within 40 inches of the soil surface; sandy family - less than 35 percent rock fragments greater than 2mm by volume.\nFormerly correlated as a moderately wet phase of Lohnes.\nThe classification was changed to the Oxyaquic subgroup even though the morphology of this pedon may meet the Aquic subgroup criteria because it was felt Oxyaquic better fit the water state of the series.  A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series.  01/2000.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
