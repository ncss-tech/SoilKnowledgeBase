  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ridgeton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy local colluvium which may overlay till. These soils are on side slopes and base slopes on moraines or non-glaciated uplands and on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 6 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.",
