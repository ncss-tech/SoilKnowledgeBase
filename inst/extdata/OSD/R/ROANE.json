  "OVERVIEW": "The Roane series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, gravelly soils that have a slowly permeable fragipan in the subsoil.  They formed in cherty alluvium or cherty colluvium in drainageways and on terraces, and toe slopes.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 6  percent but ranges from 0 to 12 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragipan ranges from about 15 to 40 inches.  Amount of angular fragments of chert and rounded gravel ranges from about 15 to 30 percent by volume in the layers above the fragipan and from 35 to 65 percent in the fragipan. Size of fragments is mostly less than 3 inches across but some are as large as 10 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout the soil except for the surface layer where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Horizons with value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  The fine earth fraction of the A horizon is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The fine earth fraction is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottled are in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray.  The fine earth fraction is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  There appears to be some cementation of coarse fragments with silica but they slake in water."
