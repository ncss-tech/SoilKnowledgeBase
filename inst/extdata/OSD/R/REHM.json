Coarse fragments, mainly of rounded chert, comprise 35 to 80 percent by volume of the 10- to 40-inch control section.  The soil is calcareous and moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam or their gravelly counterparts.\nThe B horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The fine earth fraction of the 10- to 40-inch control section is loam or clay loam and the clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  Calcium carbonate content in the Bk horizon ranges from 20 to 40 percent visible lumps and concretions.\nThe Crk horizon ranges from clayey shale to weakly consolidated sandstone with seams and pockets of limy material."

The soil formed in calcareous gravelly loamy alluvium of the Uvalde Gravel Formation of Pliocene or early Pleistocene time, mainly in areas where the Uvalde Gravel overlies the Escondido Formation of the Gulf series.  The climate is dry subhumid or semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 21 to 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 235 to 260 days and elevation ranges from 600 to 1200 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 26 to 36."
