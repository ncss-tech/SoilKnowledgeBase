  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Relley soils are on fan skirts and inset fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mostly volcanic rocks, with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,650 meters. The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
