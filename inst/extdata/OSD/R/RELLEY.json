  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Relley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed dominantly volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on fan skirts and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
