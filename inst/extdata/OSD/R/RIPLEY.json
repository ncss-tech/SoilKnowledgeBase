The soil has a typic aridic moisture regime.\nContrasting texture: Fine sand or loamy fine sand occurs at a depth of 20 to 40 inches below the surface.\nSoil temperature - 72 to 78 degrees F.\nOrganic matter: less than 0.5 percent and decreases irregularly with depth due to fine stratification\nC horizons - Hue: 2.5Y, 7.5 or 10YR\nValue: 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist\nTexture:  Upper part of the control section is silt loam, silt or very fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Some pedons have thin layers of silty clay loam mixed in the upper part but average less than 18 percent clay.\nStructure: Massive or has platy structure related to stratification or has weak subangular blocky structure.\nEffervescence: Strong effervescence or violent effervescence in the upper part. Slightly effervescence to strong effervescence in the lower part (2C3 horizon).\nEletrical conductivity:0 to 50 dS/m\nSAR-0 to 15."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ripley soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent but are usually less than 1 percent.  Elevations are minus 225 to 1,400 feet.  The climate is hot and arid. The mean annual precipitation is about 2 to 7 inches. The mean January temperature is about 53 degrees F., the mean July temperature about 92 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 70 to 76 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 250 to 365 days."

Aco soils have distinct calcium carbonate segregations and are on higher terraces.  Carrizo soils are sandy and gravelly throughout the control section.  Chuckawalla and Orita soils are on higher terraces and have argillic horizons.  Imperial soils have more than 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch zone.  Rositas soils are sand or loamy sand in the 10 to 40 inch zone."
