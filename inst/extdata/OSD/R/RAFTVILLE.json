  "REVDATE": "05/2004",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Raftville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and stream alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping strath terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture is silt loam, sandy loam, or loam or their gravelly analogs.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.  Reaction is neutral to very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam, or their gravelly analogues.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt and 2BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogs of sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. Rock fragments range from 15 to 80 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 3R horizon consists of layers of very hard chert and sandstone."

Alonzville, Bailegap, Beersheba, Gunstock, Hambrook, Harmiller, Keener, Jefferson, Lonewood, Marr, Riney, Sassafras, Shinbone, and Sunnyside soils do not have a lithic contact within 40 inches.  In addition, Beersheba, Gunstock, and Harmiller soils have a paralithic contact.  Lily soils have fewer rock fragments in the lower part of the profile."
