  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F.  The moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 45 to 80 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist with chroma of 2 or 3.  It is noncalcareous to slightly calcareous.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist, with chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is extremely gravelly loam, but the range includes very gravelly loam.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium from chert, limestone and quartzite.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 80 to 100 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 10 inches.  (A1, A2 horizons).\nDuripan - an indurated layer of both silica and lime at a depth of about 10 to 20 inches (Bkqm horizon).\nIn  Utah the soil is correlated with upland range sites.\nThe classification was changed from Orthidic Durixerolls to Haploxerollic Durixerolls in 9/94.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
