  "OVERVIEW": "The Raub series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep or very deep to dense till. The Raub soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
