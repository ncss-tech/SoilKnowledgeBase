The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) during the winter and spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low or moderately low in the dense till substratum. Permeability is moderate in the loess, moderately slow in the till subsoil, and slow or very slow in the dense till substratum."
