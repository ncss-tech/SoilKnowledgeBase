    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redford soils are mostly on shoulders and backslopes of ballenas and fan remnants in intermontane basins. These soils formed in gravelly alluvium and residuum derived from fanglomerate. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,800 to 3,995 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 240 to 280 days."
