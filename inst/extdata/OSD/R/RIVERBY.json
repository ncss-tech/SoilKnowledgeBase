  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.  Gravel content ranges from 10 to 60 percent in the A horizon and from 35 to 95 percent by volume in the C horizon. The content of cobbles ranges from 5 to 50 percent in parts of the C horizon.  In some pedons the cobble content increases with depth.  In some pedons there are thin layers of sandy material with no rock fragments. The reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon or Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Where the value and chroma are less than 3.5, the A horizon is 6 inches or less in thickness.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loamy sand, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6, and in some pedons there are thin strata with value of 3, and chroma of 3.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sandy loam.  Thin strata or pockets of loamy sand or sand are present in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Soils in similar families include the Beanblossom, Beavercreek, Bloomsdale, Ceda, Elsah, and Midco series.  Beanblossom, Beavercreek, Bloomsdale, Elsah , and Midco soils have mesic temperature regimes.  Ceda and Midco soils have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Riverby soils are on flood plains in watersheds dominated by soils that formed in residuum from cherty limestone, siltstone, shale, and gravelly marine sediments. Most areas are narrow strips along major streams.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature about 61 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches at the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bodine, Ennis, Humphreys, Lee, Lobelville, and Pruitton soils. Bodine soils have thick Bt horizons and are on nearby hillsides.  Ennis, Lee, Lobelville and Pruitton soils have less gravel in the particle size control section and are on slightly higher positions. Humphreys soils have less fragments throughout and are on nearby toe slopes and alluvial fans."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained. Slow runoff. Rapid permeability. These soils are subject to frequent flooding for very brief to brief periods.  An apparent water table is between 4 and 5 feet during winter and spring."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Areas of this soil are used mainly for woodland and pasture. A few small areas are used as cropland.  Native vegetation is woodland consisting of sycamore, sweetgum, hackberry, maple, walnut, poplar, and ironwood."
