  "OVERVIEW": "The Rabbitcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks. Rabbitcreek soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
