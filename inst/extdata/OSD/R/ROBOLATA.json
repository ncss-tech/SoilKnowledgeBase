  "OVERVIEW": "The Robolata series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from mixed sources. Robolata soils are on stream terraces on valley floors. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
