    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more. Gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout. The soil ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. The A horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. The E horizon has textures similar to those of the A horizon.\nSome pedons have a BE or EB horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. The BE horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. The EB horizon is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon is multicolored and includes matrix hue of 2.5Y. The Bt horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has colors similar to those of the Bt horizon. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 8, or is mottled with these or other hue without dominant matrix color.  The C horizon is sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  It commonly contains sandy loam lamellae."

Baymeade soils have Bh bodies in the E horizon. Blaney soils have a B horizon that is brittle in 10 to 60 percent of the mass. Chisolm soils have an apparent water table and are not as steep. Chipola soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Coosaw and Garcon soils have low chroma Fe depletions in the lower part of the E horizon and in the Bt horizon. Gomery soils have sandstone within a depth of 60 inches. Kenansville soils have an apparent water table below a depth of 4 feet. Tenaha soils have soft sandstone and shale within a depth of 60 inches. Tomahawk and Valhalla soils have a Bh horizon beneath the argillic horizon. Uchee soils have a clayey Bt horizon and moderately slow permeability."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Remlik soils are on side slopes of the Coastal Plain. Slopes commonly are 2 to 45 percent but range to 65 percent. The soils formed in loamy and sandy textured fluvial and marine sediments.  The climate is humid temperate and mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 48 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 62 degrees F. Elevation at the type location is about 17 feet."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. In the past Remlik soils have been included in Wayside soils and in higher units of classification.\n2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Arenic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 27 inches which has a sandy particle-size class (A and E horizons).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 27 to 38 inches (Bt horizon).\nSIR = VA0182, VA0327 (GRAVELLY)\nMLRA = 133A, 153A\nREVISED = 7/9/96, MHC added activity class; 7/25/11, DTA-changed C horizon to E and Bt horizon; 8/7/2018, DTA changed E and Bt back to C horizon.  No notes to justify the change in 2011.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Virginia Polytechnic Institute soil survey lab data shows the typical pedon of the Remlik series to have a base saturation of 18 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon. The particle-size control section has 18.6 percent clay and 7.7 percent silt as a weighted average.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5         Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip   Elevation\nVA0182  REMLIK      2-65    58-62     190-240     42-48     10-250\nVA0327  REMLIK      6-60    58-62     190-240     42-48     10-250\nSOI-5          FloodL  FloodH   Watertable      Kind            Months        Bedrock    Hardness\nVA0182      NONE                     4.0-6.0           PERCHED    DEC-MAR        >60\nVA0327      NONE                     4.0-6.0           PERCHED    DEC-MAR       >60\nSOI-5      Depth  Texture                       3-Inch    No-10    Clay%   -CEC-\nVA0182    0-27    FS                             0-0       80-100    0- 5       1- 6\nVA0182    0-27    LS LFS                      0-0       80-100    0-10       1- 6\nVA0182  27-38    SL L SCL                   0-0       95-100    8-25       3- 8\nVA0182  38-70    SR S LS                    0-0       95-100    2-12       1- 4\nVA0327    0-27   GR-LS GR-LFS           0-0       50- 75     0-10         -\nVA0327  27-38   SL L GR-SCL              0-0       50-100    8-25         -\nVA0327  38-70   SR S LS                     0-0       50-100    2-12         -\nSOI-5      Depth    -pH-       O.M.
