The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.  Lime silica weakly cemented fragments and durinodes range from 5 to 45 percent in all horizons.  Lime silica weakly cemented lenses occur through out the profile and thickness ranges from 1/16 to 3 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe C1ca horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak subangular blocky structure or is massive.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."
