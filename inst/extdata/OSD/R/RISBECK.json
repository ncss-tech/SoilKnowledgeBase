The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.  Lime silica weakly cemented fragments and durinodes range from 5 to 45 percent in all horizons.  Lime silica weakly cemented lenses occur through out the profile and thickness ranges from 1/16 to 3 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe C1ca horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak subangular blocky structure or is massive.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is 29 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 69 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.
