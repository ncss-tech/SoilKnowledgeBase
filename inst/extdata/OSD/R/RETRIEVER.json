  "OVERVIEW": "The Retriever series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from limestone.  Retriever soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

The Penthouse, Graham, Continental and Palos Verdes soils all have Bt horizons and Graham soils have a mollic epipedon.  Rimrock soils are fine-textured, have smectitic mineralogy, and crack deeply upon drying. The Glendale and Anthony soils are both deep soils and lack bedrock at shallow depths."
