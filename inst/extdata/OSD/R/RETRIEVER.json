These soils are at elevations of 1800 to 4500 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. to 65 degrees F. The average frost-free period is about 225 days."

Mescal and Bridge soils both have mixed mineralogy and lack bedrock at shallow depths which 19 characteristic of the Retriever soils. The Penthouse, Graham, Continental and Palos Verdes soils all have Bt horizons and Graham soils have a mollic epipedon.  Rimrock soils are fine-textured, have smectitic mineralogy, and crack deeply upon drying. The Glendale and Anthony soils are both deep soils and lack bedrock at shallow depths."
