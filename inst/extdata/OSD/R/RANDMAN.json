  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and any C horizon above the contrasting IIC horizon and these are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 and has faint to prominent mottling.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It has distinct to prominent mottles and if base chroma exceeds 2, has some mottles with chroma of 2 or less.   This horizon is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 55 percent silt, and 15 to 75 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Randman soils are on nearly level to gently concave areas on low terrace levels.  Slopes typically range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured parent sediments usually containing moderate amounts of sand and overlying beds of sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 56 degrees F."
