  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil does not have free carbonates to depths of 8 to 12 inches.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 1 inch wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2.  In some pedons a thin film of uncoated silt and sand grains are on the faces of peds in upper 1 or 2 inches. Tongues and coatings similar in color to the A horizon typically extend into or through the B horizon along cracks.  The Bt horizon is silty clay or clay averaging between 45 and 60 percent clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay and is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 4.  The C horizon is clay or silty clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Bedded shale is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gerbana (T, MT), and Gerber (MT) series.  Gerbana soils are moderately deep over semiconsolidated shale and mudstone.  Gerber soils formed in alluvium, till, or glaciolacustrine material and have a lithologic discontinuity over till within a depth of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ridgeview soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands, with slope gradients from 0 to 6 percent.  Surfaces are concave or plane.  The soils have formed in clayey residuum weathered from bedded shale.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Belfield, Daglum, Grail, Moreau, Regent, and Rhoades soils. Belfield soils are in swale positions in the same landscape and have a natric horizon.  The Grail soils are in swales, have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches thick, and typically have less clay. Moreau soils do not have a argillic horizon and have bedrock at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Regent and Savage soils typically have less clay and do not crack as much.  In addition, Regent soils have bedrock at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Dalgum and Rhoades soils are in similar landscapes but are slightly lower (micro relief) and have a natric horizon. The Moreau and Regent soils are on similar but more sloping landscapes."
