The particle-size control section averages 12 to\n25 percent clay with 5 to 15 percent gravel and 45 to 70 percent stones.  Some of the stones are loose on the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry, and\nchroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam."

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevation is\n2,000 to 3,800 feet.  These soils formed in loess over basalt.\nThe mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The mean\nannual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period\nis 100 to 150 days."
