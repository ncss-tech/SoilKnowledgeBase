  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to accumulations of calcium carbonate is 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 14 to 31 inches.   The moisture control section is usually moist in some part in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and has subhorizons with hue of 10YR.  It has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent fine and coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Textures are commonly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam and less commonly loamy sand.  It is commonly slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent between a depth of 40 and 60 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in this layer is estimated to be 1 to 5 percent.  It is slightly alkaline in layers lacking calcium carbonate and moderately alkaline in layers containing calcium carbonate."

Arwite soils have Bt horizons with hue no redder than 10YR.  Augustine, Dermala, Flugle, Goesling, Lykorly, and Maia soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section during the 120 days following the winter solstice.  Banquito, Carri, Evpark, Nyjack and Todest soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Bigbow soils have buried horizons at depths of less than 40 inches.  Celacy, Elwop, and Oldwolf soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Dalhart soils have average annual soil temperatures of 52 to 59 degrees F.  Deekay soils have 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section. Fort Collins and Stoneham soils have soil temperatures greater than 41 degrees F. for 210 to 240 days. Iwela, Nomrah, Orlie, and Parkelei soils are usually dry in the moisture control section in May and June.  Olnest soils are 12 to 23 inches to free carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rauzi soils are on fan remnants, backslopes, footslopes, toeslopes, and in valleys.  They formed in alluvium or eolian deposits derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstones, shales, and porcelanite.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
