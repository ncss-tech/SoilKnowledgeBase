Geta soils are formed in mixed alluvium from volcanic rocks and receive 5 to 8 inches of precipitation, sudgesting these soils are not ustic intergrades. Stronghold soils have greater than 1 percent organic matter in the surface. Bilgray, Kinco, Luckyhills, and Stronghold soils are not moist in the control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and Septmeber."
