  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Depth to stratification ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments typically are absent, but volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and is slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.  Carbonates are absent to a depth of 60 inches or more.   Redox features are in the albic or spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches and continue to 60 inches or more.  Saturation occurs in or above the spodic horizon and within 20 inches at some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture od the A or Ap is fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nRobago soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.  The Bt horizon is stratified, at least in the lower part, in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is typically stratified very fine sandy loam, silt loam, very fine sand, and fine sand but strata of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, sugar maple, yellow birch, balsam fir, paper birch, eastern hemlock, and quaking aspen.  A few areas have been cleared and are used for cropland or pastureland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay."
