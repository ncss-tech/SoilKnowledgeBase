They formed in colluvium and alluvium from mixed sources but dominantly quartzite and limestone.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 39 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 50 to 100 days.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,500 feet."

Hymas soils have limestone bedrock within 20 inches of the surface.  Ridgecrest soils are loamy-skeletal and are moderately deep.  Wahtigup soils are calcareous to the surface and are not pachic.  Cedarhill soils are on south-facing mountain slopes.  Hymas soils are on ridges.  Ridgecrest soils are on convex mountain slopes.  Wahtigup soils are on concave south-facing mountain slopes."
