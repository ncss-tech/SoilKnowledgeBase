  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ricrest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from mixed sources but dominantly limestone and quartzite.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on foothills and mountain ridges and slopes and have slopes of 8 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
