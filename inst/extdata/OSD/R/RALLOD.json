  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact and interbedded shale and sandstone ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Depth to continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation is 6 to 14 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  Coarse fragments are absent throughout the profile.  Organic carbon content ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the surface and decreases regularly with depth.  Colors are quite variable throughout the profile due to the variegated shale and sandstone parent material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  An E horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe Btn and Btnk horizons have hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is typically clay or sandy clay, but clay ranges from 35 to 55 percent, silt from 0 to 50 percent, and sand from 15 to 65 percent.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy clay, clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 27 to 45 percent.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  A thin C horizon may be present in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this class, but the Mudray and Youjay soils are similar.  Both soils have less than one percent organic carbon in the upper 15 inches when averaged.  Also Mudray soils have a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rallod soils are on rolling hillslope positions and ridge crests.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sodic shale and sandstone.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,300 feet in Wyoming and down to 3,000 feet in Montana.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist spring and dry summers and fall.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and ranges from 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. but ranges from 36 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to be 80 to 110 days; but, because of elevation, aspect, and air drainage, frost may occur at any time."

Absher, Abston, and Tisworth soils are moderately deep or deep and occur more on footslopes and toeslopes downslope from the Rallod soils.  Seaverson soils do not have natric horizons and occur on the more unstable hillslope positions."
