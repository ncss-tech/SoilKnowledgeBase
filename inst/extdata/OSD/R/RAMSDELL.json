  "OVERVIEW": "The Ramsdell series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on level or nearly level low stream terraces and depressions on floodplains and valley floors.  They formed in silty alluvium.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
