  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil is moist during the winter months and early spring.  On drying, large cracks (1/2 to 4 inches wide) extend from the surface to as deep as 50 inches forming large prisms.  The cracks remain open during July through October for about 60 to 120 days and close with soil wetting in December or January and remain closed until the soil dries about July.  Few to common intersecting slickensides and few to common wedge shape aggregates are a depth of 5 to 48 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 40 to 60 inches.  Some pedons near basin rims have paralithic tuff at a depth 40 to 60 inches.  Some pedons have loamy or gravelly layers at a depth of over 40 inches.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2, 6/2; 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 or 2.5Y 4/2.  Moist values of 3 are in the upper 3 inches in some pedons.  It is clay or silty clay with a weighted average of 40 to 60 percent clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Structure is very fine or fine granular.\nThe Bss and Bw horizons are 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4; 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 2.5Y 5/2. Moist color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 2.5Y 4/2.   It is clay or silty clay but ranges to include clay loam.  The structure is medium, coarse or very coarse prismatic or is prismatic parting to angular blocky.   Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline and noncalcareous to strongly calcareous with few to common fine filaments and treads of lime or gypsum in the lower part.  Few 5 to 10 mm lime concretions are below a depth of 50 inches in some pedons."

Brubeck, Karcal and Waspo soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Doten soils have slight to strong concentration of salt and have mottles at a depth of 22 to 36 inches.  Horsecamp soils have Bk horizons at 25 to 35 inches and have cracks; open 180 to 210 days.  Manogue soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to carbonates and are well drained, lack flooding or ponding and are on hills, plateaus and pediments.  Moroni soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 47 to 49 degrees."

These soil formed in alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, with some tuff and diatomite influence.  Elevation is 4100 to 5500 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with warm, dry summers (except for occasional summer thunderstorms that average less than an inch precipitation) and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 16 inches, including about 30 to 60 inches of snowfall.  The mean January temperature is 26 to 28 degrees F., mean July temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 44 to 48 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 60 to 100 days.  These soils received runoff from adjacent areas."
