  "OVERVIEW": "The Roxbury series consists of very deep, moderately well drained or well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous silty alluvium on floodplains and alluvial fans on the Rolling Plains and Breaks (MLRA 73). Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters (20 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) at the type location.",
