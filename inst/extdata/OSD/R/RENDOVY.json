These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  The mantle of volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches thick, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages from 35 to 65 percent rock fragments, and 18 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Rock fragments are rounded.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.

These soils formed in glacial till from sedimentary and volcanic rock with a mantle of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F., the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F., and the average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days."
