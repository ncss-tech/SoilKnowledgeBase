  "OVERVIEW": "The Razor series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from calcareous shales.  Razor soils are on plains, hills and breaks to major drainages.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
