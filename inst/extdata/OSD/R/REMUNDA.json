Celososprings soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Charette soils have basalt rock fragments in the control section. Concho soils are calcareous within 24 inches of the surface.  Partri have a calcic horizon below the argillic horizon.  Quivera soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Swastika soils have pedogenic calcium carbonate at a depth of 16 to 30 inches."

These soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping alluvial fans and valley slopes at elevation of 5,600 toe 7,400 feet. Parent material are derived mostly from mixed sedimentary and igneous rock. These soils occur in a semiarid continental climate. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches with a summer maximum. The average annual temperature is about 50 to 57 degrees F."
