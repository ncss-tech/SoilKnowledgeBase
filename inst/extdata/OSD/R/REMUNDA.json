  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Remunda series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks. These soils are typically on strongly sloping alluvial fans and valley slopes. They have slow permeability. Their slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15, and average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
