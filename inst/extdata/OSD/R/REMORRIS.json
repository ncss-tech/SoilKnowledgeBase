Canyon, Epping, Eslendo, Gerst, Picante, Sandoval, Shingle, Taluce, Tesihim, and Tassel soils are 7.5YR or yellower.  Taluce, Tassel, and Tesihim soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Simel soils have a lithic contact underlying the paralithic contact.  Quarteles soils have 10 to 20 percent volcanic glass.  Canyon, Epping, Tassel, Gerst, Redarrow, Shingle, and Taluce soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June."

The soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and local residuum derived from Morrison formation siltstone and shale. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches. Elevation ranges from 4,270 to 8,000 feet."
