  "OVERVIEW": "The Robertsdale series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on nearly level or slightly depressed upland areas of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area (133A). They formed in loamy marine and fluviomarine sediments.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 67 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
