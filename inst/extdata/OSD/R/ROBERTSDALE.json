    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Clarendon series is the only known competing series. The Saucier series is in a closely related family.  The moderately well drained Clarendon soils are on higher positions and have less than 5 percent hard iron concretions and less than 20 percent silt in the control section.  The moderately well drained Saucier soils are on higher positions and have less than 5 percent hard iron concretions in the control section."

The climate is humid subtropical. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 67 inches."

Escambia soils are on similar positions and have coarse-loamy subsoils. Grady soils are in similar to lower positions have less than 5 percent plinthite, by volume and have clayey control sections.  The moderately well drained Harleston soils are on higher positions have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite and have coarse-loamy control sections. The moderately well drained Irvington soils are on higher positions. The moderately well and well drained Malbis and Poarch soils are on higher positions.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Ap and EBc horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 68 inches (Btc, Btvg1, Btvg2 and Btgv3 horizons).\nPlinthic horizon - the zone from 21 to 68 inches (Btvg1, Btvg2 and Btgv3 horizons).\nAquic feature - Robertsdale soils are saturated to near the surface in late winter and the spring.\nRobertsdale soils were formerly identified as a flat phase within the Irvington series and placed in the Red-Yellow Podzolic great soil group with a fragipan.  The classification is changed to Plinthaquic Paleudults.  Silt content is specified as being over 20 percent.\nRobertsdale soils are in MLRA 133A.\nADDITIONAL DATA: There is no record of soil laboratory data for the Robertsdale series in the database at this time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
