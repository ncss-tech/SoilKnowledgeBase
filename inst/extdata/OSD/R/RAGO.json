  "OVERVIEW": "The Rago series consists of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils that formed in eolian material of two ages with a paleosol marking the contact and local alluvium.  Rago soils are on concave upland flats, drainageways, flood plains and depressions and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 10 centimeters (49 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) at the type location.",
