  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 80 inches. The depth to horizons with distinct or prominent redoximorphic features is less than 20 inches. The series control section contains less than 2 percent rock fragments which are 2 to 5mm in diameter. The texture in the particle-size control section is fine sand with less than 15 percent of coarse sand and coarser and 25 percent or less medium sand or coarser. The reaction of the series control section is strongly acid or slightly acid in the upper part and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part. The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days at some time during the 120 days following the summer solstice in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand or sand. Some pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand or loamy sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in this horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is fine sand, or sand. It has redoximorphic features in all parts. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sand or sand. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with stratified textures of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand. Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aylmer, Clearriver, Hiwood, Lino, Manistique (T), Meehan, Perchlake, Poppleton, Rushlake, Sciota, and Winterfield series. The Aylmer soils have a reaction of neutral or higher in all of the series control section. The Clearriver and Perchlake soils average more than 2 percent rock fragments in the series control section and have a thin zone of clay accumulation (Bt) in the series control section. The Hiwood soils do not have redoximorphic features within 20 inches. The Lino soils are substantially wetter in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice. The Manistique (T) soils have lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. The Meehan soils contain more than 25 percent medium sand and coarser in the series control section. The moderately well drained Poppleton soils do not have redoximorphic concentrations with hue 5YR or redder in the B horizon. The Rushlake soils have pH of 7.4 or higher in the series control section and have more than 5 percent rock fragments. The Scioto soils are dry for less than 20 consecutive days at some time during the 120 days following the summer solstice in most years. Winterfield soils are on flood plains and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane to slightly convex slopes with gradient of 0 to 3 percent on glacial lake plains, deltas and outwash plains. They formed in sandy glacial outwash or lacustrine, deep fine sand or sand sediments of Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 28 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 785 to 1,600 feet above sea level."

The moderately well drained Clearriver, Hiwood and Poppleton soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The Cormant soils are poorly and very poorly drained and have nearly level or level plane or slightly concave slopes. The very poorly drained Deerwood, Leafriver and Markey soils formed in organic material over sand and are in lower lying areas."
