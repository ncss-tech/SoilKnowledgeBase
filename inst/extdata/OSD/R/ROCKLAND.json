Mass soil movement has left random remnants of soil structure from prior upslope soil development and has buried tree branches, leaves and moss.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to User Pedon ID S03MI-131-009 for Primary Characterization Data from the National Soil Survey Laboratory (http://ssldata.nrcs.usda.gov/querypage.asp).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
