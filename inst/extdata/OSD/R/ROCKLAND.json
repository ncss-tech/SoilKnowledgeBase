  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockland series consists of well drained soils formed in loamy colluvium from rotational landslides on slopes of stream valleys and dissections of ground moraines.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the upper part of the profile and moderately slow in the lower part.  Slopes range from 18 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
