They formed in colluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from Tertiary granitic fanglomerate. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Encantado soils are sandy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes of eroded fan remnants generally on adjacent south-facing slopes. Nazario soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on narrow beveled summits of eroded fan remnants."
