  "OVERVIEW": "The Resolana series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from granitic fanglomerate. Resolana soils are on north-facing backslopes of eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
