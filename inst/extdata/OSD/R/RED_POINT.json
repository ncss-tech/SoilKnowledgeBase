  "OVERVIEW": "The Red Point series consist of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum from interbedded sandstone and shale. Red Point soils are on eroded fan remnants and pediments. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
