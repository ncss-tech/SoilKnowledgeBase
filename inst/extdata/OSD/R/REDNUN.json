  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rednun series consists of deep, well to moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in thick, medium to moderately fine textured, reddish brown to yellowish red calcareous alluvial fan sediments derived from redbed shales and loamstones.  Rednun soils are on alluvial fans and valley filling side slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual percipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  The solum is 15 to 42 inches thick.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  Conductivity is usually less than 1 millimhos, and exchangeable sodium less than 1 percent.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from 60 to 90 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature from 60 to 76 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section but are usually moist in some part of the soil above the lower boundary of the moisture control section.  They are moist in all parts of the moisture control section less than 60 consecutive days in the 120 days following the winter solstice.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It usually has fine granular primary structure, but it may be subangular blocky in plowed fields.  It is usually slightly acid to mildly alkaline but moderately alkaline reaction is permitted, providing that the horizon is noncalcareous.  It is soft to slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is usually light clay, but clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent, silt from 15 to 45 percent, and sand from 15 to 45 percent with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is usually slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the upper part and mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the lower part, but may be moderately alkline in the upper part if that portion is noncalcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  It is typically loam or light clay loam.  It is mildly to strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges to 14 percent and visible accumulation of secondary carbonate occurs consistently in the form of concretions, seams, and streaks."

Ashfork, Chapin, Thunderbird, and Wormser soils have lithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Blackpipe, Boquillas, Emigrant, Huggins, Leyden, and Querc soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Boneek, Loma, Richfield, and Savo soils all have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in their particle-size control  sections.  Collbran soils have a high proportion of dark colored, magnetic, ferromagnesium minerals in the sand and silt fractions Ryus soils are calcareous throughout their solums.  Showlow soils have calcic horizons.  Standley soils have over 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Torreon soils have calcic horizons and solums thicker than 42 inches.  Kube, Nunn, and Sofia soils have hues of 7.5YR and yellower."
