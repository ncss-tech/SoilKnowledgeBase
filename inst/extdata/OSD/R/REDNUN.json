  "OVERVIEW": "The Rednun series consists of deep, well to moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in thick, medium to moderately fine textured, reddish brown to yellowish red calcareous alluvial fan sediments derived from redbed sandstone, shale and loamstone. Rednun soils are on alluvial fans, valley filling side slopes and strike valleys. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual percipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
