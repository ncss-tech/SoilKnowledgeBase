  "STATES": "IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Renova series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters.",
