    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rathdrum soils are in depressions and concave positions on glacial outwash plains and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in volcanic ash over glacial outwash materials.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters, and warm, relatively dry summers.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches and average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Bonner and Kootenai soils are on outwash terraces and plains and have a sandy-skeletal substratum at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hoodoo soils are on flood plains and drainageways and are poorly drained.  Kaniksu soils are on outwash terraces and plains and have a thin mantle of volcanic ash and a sandy control section.  McGuire soils are on outwash terraces and are loamy-skeletal and have a mesic soil temperature regime."
