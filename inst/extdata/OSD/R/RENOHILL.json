  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 28 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments are typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent.  The majority of the rock fragments are soft and break down upon pretreatment.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5.  Texture is clay or heavy clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  This horizon is typically noncalcareous throughout but may be effervescent immediately above the Btk horizon.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Secondary carbonates range from 3 to 12 percent.  EC ranges up to 4 mmhos/cm.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, clay, silty clay loam or silty clay with 28 to 42 percent clay.  Secondary carbonates range from 5 to 15 percent.  EC ranges up to 4 mmhos/cm.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft, effervescent shale interbedded with thin lenses of sandstone or siltstone. In some pedons the bedrock is noneffervescent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Renohill soils are on bedrock controlled plateaus, alluvial fans, hills and ridges.  They formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from calcareous shale.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches most of  which falls as snow and rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 130 days."

Bidman and Parmleed have greater than 15 percent increase of clay within 1 vertical inch between the E and Bt horizons.  Cushman and Forkwood have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Nuncho and Platmak have mollic epipedons.  Samday soils have bedrock above 20 inches. Savageton and Silhouette soils have cambic horizons and are calcareous throughout.  Bidman, Forkwood, Nuncho, Platmak, Silhouette and Ulm soils occur on backslope and footslopes of hills and ridges.  Cushman, Parmleed, Samday, and Savageton soils occur on similar positions."
