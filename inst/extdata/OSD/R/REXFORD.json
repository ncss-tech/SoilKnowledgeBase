  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to stratified sand and gravel ranges from 35 to 72 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 40 percent in A, B and Bx horizons and from 15 to 75 percent in the C horizon.  Unlimed, the reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid above the fragipan and from strongly to slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth.\nThe B horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and dominant chromas of 1 or 2, with individual horizons with chroma 3 to 6 and are mottled.  The Bw horizon of some pedons are free of mottling.  The B horizons above the fragipan are sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth.\nThe Bx horizons have hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  They have both high and low chroma mottles.  They are sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth.  The secondary structure in some pedon is subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth and ranges to stratified sand and gravel."

The Morris and Scriba soils do not have stratified material within the series control section.\nAtherton, Braceville, Erie, Fredon, Halsey, Phelps, Red Hook and Volusia series are in related families.  Atherton, Fredon, Halsey, Phelps and Red Hook soils do not have fragipans.  Braceville soils do not have dominant chroma of 2 or less on ped faces within a depth of 20 inches.  The Erie and Volusia soils have more than 18 percent clay within the series control section."

The soils developed in water sorted materials derived largely from gray sandstone and shale.  Climate is humid temperature with mean annual precipitation of 34 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days."
