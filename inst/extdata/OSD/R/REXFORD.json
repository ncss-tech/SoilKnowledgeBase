  "OVERVIEW": "The Rexford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained to poorly drained soils on terraces and moraines.  They formed in glacial outwash or stream terraces derived mainly from sandstone and shale.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to stratified sand and gravel ranges from 35 to 72 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 40 percent in A, B and Bx horizons and from 15 to 75 percent in the C horizon.  Unlimed, the reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid above the fragipan and from strongly to slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth.\nThe B horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and dominant chromas of 1 or 2, with individual horizons with chroma 3 to 6 and are mottled.  The Bw horizon of some pedons are free of mottling.  The B horizons above the fragipan are sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth.\nThe Bx horizons have hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  They have both high and low chroma mottles.  They are sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth.  The secondary structure in some pedon is subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth and ranges to stratified sand and gravel."
