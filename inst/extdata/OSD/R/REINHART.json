    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., and the mean winter soil temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.   The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 30 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The solum is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.  It has a P-retention of 60 to 85 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.9 to 1.0 g/cc.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and inludes all or part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Organic matter is 10 to 15 percent.\nThe BA horizon, when present, has color similar to the A horizon.  It is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam with 30 to 35 percent clay.  It has 35 to 45 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam with 30 to 35 percent clay.  It has 35 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles.  It has acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron of 1 to 2 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reinhart soils are in open grassland areas on metastable narrow ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium derived from highly sheared and weathered metasedimentary rock of the Otter Point Formation.  Elevation is 200 to 1,300 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 85 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210 to 270 days."

Reedsport soils are fine-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Sebastian soils have serpentinitic mineralogy.   Shigh soils are very deep, clayey, poorly drained, and have an albic horizon at the soil surface.  Whaleshead soils are very deep."
