  "OVERVIEW": "The Ragpie series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow to welded tuff, that formed in residuum from welded tuff.  They are on ridges and dipslopes.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
