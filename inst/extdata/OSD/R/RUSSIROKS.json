Chuckawalla, Cristobal and Pinamt series average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cololag soils are 25 to 40 centimeters to an argillic horizon and do not have a surface C horizon comprised of 90 to 100 percent rock fragments. Havasulake soils are dry throughout most of the year and have a mean annual soil temperature of 25 to 28 degrees C. Ironage soils are formed in residuum and are moderately deep (50 to 100 centimeters) to a lithic contact."
