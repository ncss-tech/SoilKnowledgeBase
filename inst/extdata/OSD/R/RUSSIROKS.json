  "BYREV": "Rev: PBF/CAH/ET",
  "REVDATE": "12/2015",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Russiroks series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks. Russiroks soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

Chuckawalla, Cristobal and Pinamt series average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cololag soils are 25 to 40 centimeters to an argillic horizon and do not have a surface C horizon comprised of 90 to 100 percent rock fragments. Havasulake soils are dry throughout most of the year and have a mean annual soil temperature of 25 to 28 degrees C. Ironage soils are formed in residuum and are moderately deep (50 to 100 centimeters) to a lithic contact."
