  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockmarsh series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy-skeletal and sandy-skeletal alluvium and in dense loamy-skeletal till on flood plains and stream terraces. Permeability is moderate in the loamy skeletal alluvium, rapid in the sandy skeletal alluvium, moderate in the till subsoil, and very slow in the dense till substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
