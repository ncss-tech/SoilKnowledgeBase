Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 12 to 25 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is greater than 15 percent. The weighted average content of coarse fragments in the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 85 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 25 to 45 percent in the surface and subsoil and from 5 to 70 percent in the substratum. Volume of cobbles ranges from 10 to 35 percent throughout. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout. Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an Oa horizon with similar colors.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is very cobbly silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is the very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly analogs of sandy loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Bw horizons with spodic color do not have an overlying albic horizon or have pH greater than 5.9 or have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon. Texture is the very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly analogs of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is the very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogs of sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 3Btg horizon with textures and colors like the 3Bt horizon except that it has chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe 3Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5G, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.

The somewhat excessively drained Bigisland soils occupy higher, steeply sloping landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Clemens soils are on similar landscape positions but are underlain by sandy skeletal deposits. The moderately well drained Dairyland soils have less clay in the control section and occupy slightly higher landscape positions than the Rockmarsh soils. The very poorly drained Makwa soils occupy slightly lower landscape positions than the Rockmarsh soils."

Permeability is moderate in the loamy-skeletal alluvium, rapid in the sandy-skeletal alluvium, moderate in the till subsoil, and very slow in the dense till substratum. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet from October to May in normal years. These soils are frequently flooded for brief periods during April in most years, but a non-flooded phase is recognized."
