(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).\nAp--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many coarse, medium, and fine roots; many tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches)\nC1--7 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (11 to 32 inches thick)\nC2--21 to 26 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/'2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common tubular pores; strongly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.\n2Cr--26 to 36 inches; white (2.5Y 8/2) semi-consolidated siltstone.\nTYPE LOCATION;  Franklin County, Washington; 3 miles northwest of Basin City; 900 feet north and 100 feet east of the southwest corner of sec.  7, T. 13 N., R. 29 E.\nRANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS;  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry (120 out of 210 days) between depths of 12 to 35 inches or to the paralithic contact if the contact is less than 35 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y. Value is 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nCOMPETING SERIES;  These are the Berent, Goldrun, Hotsprings, Incy, Quincy, Quinton, Toll, Walco, Winchester, and Zorravista series. All of these except Quinton and Walco are deeper than 40 inches.  The Quinton and Walco soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING;  Rinquin soils are on high terraces at elevations of 800 to 1,100 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in outwash and eolian sand over siltstone. These soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The average annual temperature is  50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 180 to 200 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS;  These are the Hezel, Quincy, and Ottmar series. The Hezel series is sandy over loamy and more than 60 inches deep.  The Quincy series is sandy and is more than 40 inches deep.  The Ottmar series is fine-silty and has a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches."
