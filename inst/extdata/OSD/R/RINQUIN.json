  "OVERVIEW": "The Rinquin series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on terraces.  These soils formed in outwash and eolian sand over siltstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 8 inches.",

Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y. Value is 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

These soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.
