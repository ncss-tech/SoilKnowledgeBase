  "OVERVIEW": "The Radol series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite with minor components of shale and sandstone. Radol soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
