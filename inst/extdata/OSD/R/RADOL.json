Elevations range from 1,783 to 2,770 meters. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite with minor component of shale and sandstone. The climate is dry and semiarid. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 360 mm. Frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
