  "OVERVIEW": "The Rawlins series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on relict fan aprons, terraces, fan pediments, and toeslopes on valley margins.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation ranges from 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the top of the argillic horizon to 40 inches, when averaged, has less than 18 percent noncarbonate clay and from 5 to 25 percent rock fragments, mostly pebbles with a few semirounded cobbles.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos through the Bk and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures are loamy sand or sandy loam and may have gravelly modifiers. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, or gravelly sandy loam with 18 to 28 percent clay and 0 to 20 percent coarse fragments, mainly pebbles.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay but is sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam where carbonate clay is present and raises total clay to about 24 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 30 percent pebbles with a few stones.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 8 to 25 percent with inconsistent pockets ranging up to 35 percent.  It is mildly through strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay and 5 to 20 percent pebbles with a few cobbles.  Most carbonates are authigenic and disseminated with few soft masses.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

All of these soils have 18 percent or less clay in the Bt horizon, and the base of the argillic horizon is below 10 inches.  Also, Canwall, Cotha, Elk Mountain, Means, and Rohonda soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Ryan Park soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Ryark soils are noncalcareous throughout."

Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations are 6,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow and less commonly as rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 75 to 100 days."
