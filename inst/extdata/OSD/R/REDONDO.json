(A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 22 to 68 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nVitrandic feature: throughout the pedon, based on measured glass content and estimated oxalate extractable Al and Fe.\nParticle-size control section: from 22 to 42 inches (Bt, 2Bt1, and part of the 2Bt2 horizon)\nThe 3/2002 revision changes the subgroup from Eutric to Vitrandic. This is based on NSSL glass count data and estimated oxalate Al and Fe. Glass counts are high enough for Vitrandic, but not high enough for ashy-skeletal and glassy family classes. Additional sampling may show these classes to be typical."
