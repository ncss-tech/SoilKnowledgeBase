    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. with an O horizon present. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter. It has greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 10 cmol/kg of KCL-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried). It is weakly or moderately smeary. The particle-size control section has 10 to 20 percent clay content by field estimates, with 35 to 80 percent rock fragments. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon have value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is medial loam or medial sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay content by field estimate. It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles. It has 4 to 8 percent organic matter.\nThe AC horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is medial sandy loam or medial loam with 10 to 20 percent clay content by field estimate. It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles. It has 4 to 8 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is medial loam or medial sandy loam  with 10 to 20 percent clay content by field estimate. It has 15 to 45 percent gravel and 20 to 50 percent cobbles. It has 1 to 4 percent organic matter."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are the Quinault, Station, Waketickeh, and Walkinshaw series. Quinault and Waketickeh soils are very shallow to bedrock, have a cambic horizon and an ochric epipedon. Quinault soils have a perudic moisture regime. Station and Walkinshaw soils have a cambic horizon, an ochric epipedon, and less than 2 cmol/kg of aluminum (do not meet the criteria for the Alic subgroup)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in loamy colluvium derived from basalt and other igneous and volcanic rock types. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches. The frost free period is 70 to 145 days."
