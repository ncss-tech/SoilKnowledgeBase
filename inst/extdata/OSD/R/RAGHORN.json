  "OVERVIEW": "The Raghorn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
