  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is more than 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.  and the soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F. The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches becomes moist in November or early December and remains moist until May or early June. Rock fragments make up to 15 percent of the soil.\nThe A horizon is brown light brownish gray, pale brown, light yellowish brown or light brown (lOYR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 6/4). It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is medium acid to neutral. Either a transitional A3 horizon or a Bl horizon is present. In some pedons both horizons are present.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, yellowish brown or dark brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown or light brown (lOYR 5/3 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 4/4). It is heavy clay loam or clay.   Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline. The B3 and C horizon is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe C horizon is brown, pale brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, brownish yellow, or light brown (lOYR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4). It is stratified loam, sandy loam, and clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ryer soils are on fairly old terraces and have slope gradients of O to 9 percent. They formed from alluvium from mixed but dominantly basic igneous rocks. Elevations are 40 to 1500 feet. The climate is typified by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 25 inches. Average January temperature is about 45 degrees F., average July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 59 degrees to 63 degrees F. Frost-free season is 200 to 300 days."
