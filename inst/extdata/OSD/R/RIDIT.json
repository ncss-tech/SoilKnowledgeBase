The soils formed in residuum derived from basalt and andesite with additions of loess high in volcanic ash. The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm and comes mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C."

Pedoli soils have argillic horizons, lack duripans, and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections. Rubyhill soils have strongly cemented duripans at 50 to 76 cm and fine-loamy particle-size control sections."
