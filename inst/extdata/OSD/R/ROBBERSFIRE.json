  "OVERVIEW": "The Robbersfire series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Robbersfire soils are on back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
