  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Depth to carbonates is commonly the same as solum thickness, but in some pedons the lower 2 to 6 inches of the B horizon is slightly effervescent. Rock fragments are usually absent but range to 25 percent in the solum and substratum. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral in the A, E, and B horizons and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine subangular blocky or granular structures. The consistence is friable, very friable or slightly sticky.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium platy or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Thickness ranges from 0 to 6 inches.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Individual subhorizons of 10YR hue are permitted in these horizons but dominant hue must be 7.5YR or redder. Chroma of ped faces is 2 or less. The matrix of some horizons between the base of the Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches is dominantly of more than 2 chroma. The Bt horizons are silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Average clay content of the Bt horizon ranges from 28 to 35 percent, but individual subhorizons that are outside this range are permitted. It has moderate or strong blocky structure and firm or very firm consistence.\nThe C horizon has hues of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or has weak or moderate, thick plate-like divisions. The consistence is very firm or firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Conover and Manheim series are members in the same family. Conover soils have hue of 10YR or yellower in the C horizons. Manheim soils have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y in the control section.\nThe Alden, Canadice, Colwood, Fonda, Ilion, Lakemont, Lyons, Madalin, Olmstead, Ovid, and Trumbull series also are similar soils in related families. The Alden, Colwood, Fonda, and Lyons soils do not have argillic horizons. The Canadice, Condit, Lakemont, Madalin and Trumbull soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The Ilion and Olmstead soils have hues of 10YR or yellower in the B and C horizons. The Ovid soils have an Ap horizon that does not meet the Udollic subgroup definition."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Romulus soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The Romulus soils formed in till derived from reddish calcareous shales, or lake sediment intermixed with drift from limestone and sandstone. The climate is humid and cool temperate with mean annual rainfall ranges from 30 to 45 inches and mean annual air temperature from 46 to 50 degrees F. The mean growing season is from 140 to 180 days."
