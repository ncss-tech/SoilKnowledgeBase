  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Coarse fragments, mostly sandstone or siltstone gravels and channers including up to 15 percent shale and coal fragments, range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid throughout, except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BA horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. The fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam or sandy clay loam. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown or gray are common below a depth of 40 inches becoming more numerous with depth.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has colors and textures similar to the lower Bw horizon or is variegated without dominant hue or chroma.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Most pedons have redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow or gray and some are variegated without dominant hue or chroma. The fine-earth texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam. Stratification is common below about 55 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Suches series is the only other member of this family. The Bermudian and Clifty series are in a similar family, but have an active CEC activity class. Bermudian soils have red colors inherited from red and brown shale, sandstone and conglomerate. Clifty soils have sola less than 40 inches thick. Suches soils formed in loamy alluvial sediments washed largely from soils weathered from granite, gneiss, schist, phyllite and other metamorphic rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in loamy alluvium weathered mainly from Pennsylvanian aged sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Near the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allegheny, Barbourville, Combs, Cotaco, Grigsby, Knowlton, Orrville and Pope soils. Allegheny, Cotaco and Knowlton soils are on higher terrace landforms and have argillic horizons. Barbourville soils are on adjacent alluvial fans and have umbric surface layers. Combs, Grigsby and Pope soils are coarse-loamy. Combs soils have mollic epipedons, Grigsby soils have higher base saturations, and Pope soils are on flood plains. Orrville soils are somewhat poorly drained."
