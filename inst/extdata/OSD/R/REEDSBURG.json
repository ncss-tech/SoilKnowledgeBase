  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the loess is 15 to 40 inches.  Angular chert fragments are typically in the 2B horizon and are dominantly less than 3 inches in diameter but some range to 10 inches in diameter.  Volume of chert fragments in the loess is 0 to 15 percent and is 0 to 35 percent in the clay residuum.  Volume of chert fragments larger than 3 inches in size ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loess and in the residuum.  The solum is leached of free carbonates to the depth of the dolomite.  Reaction of the surface layer and upper part of the subsoil depends on past liming practices. Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid in the B horizon and medium acid to very strongly acid in the 2B horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A horizon has the lower value and chroma and is 3 to 5 inches thick.  Some pedons have E horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 with a chroma of 2 in some subhorizons.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, averaging 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon, formed in the residuum  has 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR hue; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 8.  Less commonly it has hue of 10R.  Some pedons have hue of 10YR in the 2Bt horizon either as layers or as mottles.  The 2Bt horizon is clay, silty clay, or the cherty analogs.  It averages 40 to 80 percent clay.  Some pedons have pockets or discontinuous lenses in the 2Bt horizon with 45 to 65 percent sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reedsburg soils are on broad ridgetops and upper valley side slopes in dissected uplands underlain by limestone.  Slope gradients commonly are 2 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 12 percent.  The regolith consists of 15 to 40 inches of loess over cherty clayey residuum weathered from limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 44 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches."

The well drained NewGlarus soils are in nearby areas where the underlying dolomite is within a depth of 40 inches.  The well drained Palsgrove soils are in similar landscape positions where the loess mantle is thicker.  The well drained Valton soils occupy similar landscape positions but generally are on narrower ridgetops where the underlying dolomite is at a depth greater than 5 feet.  The well drained Wildale soils occupy similar landscape positions where the loess mantle is less than 15 inches thick."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Taxonomic placement of Reedsburg pedons hinges on the texture of the upper part of the residuum (paleosol).  The amount of clay in the upper part of the residuum will vary because of the amount of erosion or deposition (pedisediment) that has occurred prior to the loess cover.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizons zone from 9 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons); udic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime; 2 chroma mottles within 75 cm of the soil surface; clay distribution such that the percentage of clay does not decrease as much as 20 percent of the maximum within a depth of 1.5 m of the soil surface; hue redder than 10YR and chroma of more than 4 dominant in at least the lower part of the argillic horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
