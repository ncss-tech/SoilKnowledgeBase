Rock fragments, mostly gravel, on the soil surface, range from 35 to 50 percent.  NaF pH is 9.0 to 11.0 and decreases with depth.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.  Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 40 to 50 percent and decreases with depth.  Moist bulk density ranges from 0.6 to 0.85 to 18 inches then increases with depth.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/3 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.   Organic matter ranges from 5 to 7 percent.  Rock fragments range from 30 to 45 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  NaF pH is 10 to 11.5.
