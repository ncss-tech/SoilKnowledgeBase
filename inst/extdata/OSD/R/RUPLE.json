  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruple series consists of well drained, moderately slowly permeable soil that contain layers of fractured ironstone.  These soils are on the uplands in the Western Coastal Plains.  They formed in iron-rich, clayey, marine sediments high in siderite.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Average clay content of the textural control section ranges from 45 to 70 percent.  Clay content decreases with depth in the profile.  Coarse fragments (ironstone) make up from 15 to 35 percent of the volume of the surface layer and the text textural control section.  The base saturation by sum is typically greater than 45 percent throughout the textural control section.  Base saturation decreases with depth.  The depth to the first nearly continuous layer of ironstone ranges from about 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is gravelly loamy fine sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon above the layers of ironstone, has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture typically is gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay, or gravelly clay.  Content of clay ranges from  40 to 80 percent and averages about 45 to 70 percent.  Angular and flattened fragments of ironstone range from 1/8-inch to 2 inches in thickness and from 1/2-inch to 8 inches in length.  Fragments of ironstone can make up from 5 to 35 percent of the volume of any subhorizon, but the average is greater than 15 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bsm/Bt horizon consists of alternating layers of clayey material and fractured ironstone layers.  The clayey part has the same range in colors as the upper part of the Bt horizon.  It is clay, sandy clay or clay loam.  The ironstone layers are fractured  and range in thickness from 1/4-inch to 12 inches.  The lateral distance between fractures ranges from 2 to 20 inches and averages 4 to 8 inches.  Typically the layers are continuous for many feet.   In some pedons, the layers are intermittent and extend only a few feet horizontally.  In other pedons, the layers are parts of large spheroidal configurations that are separated from one another by vertical flows of clay, sandy clay or clay loam. The partially weathered loamy and sandy material, that is in pocket and layers, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam  that contains large amounts of siderite. Pockets and streaks of whitish or grayish kaolin range from fine to medium and from few to common.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Tellico series is in the same family.  Similar series include Alcoa, Anniston, Cuthbert, Davidson, Decatur, Greenville, Gwinnett, Hiwasse, Kirvin, and Nacogdoches.  The Alcoa soils formed in basic rock and have an argillic horizon that  does not decrease in content of clay by more than 20 percent  within 60 inches of the soil surface.  The Anniston, Davidson. Decatur, Greenville, Gwinnett, Hiwasse, and Nacogdoches soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  The Cuthbert and Kirvin soils have mixed mineralogy  and contain less ironstone than the Ruple species.  The Tellico soils are underlain by sandstone."

The soils formed in iron-rich, clayey, marine sediments.  The typical pedon is forming in sediments of the Cook Mountain Formation, Claiborne Group, Eocene Series.  The mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 51 inches.\nGEOGRAPHlCALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bowie and Sacul soils and the competing Kirvin soils.  The Bowie soils are on ridgetops at similar elevations and are fine-loamy.  The Kirvin soils are on similar landscapes.  The Sacul soils are on side slopes at lower elevations, and they have mixed minerology and contain less ironstone than the Rupple soils."
