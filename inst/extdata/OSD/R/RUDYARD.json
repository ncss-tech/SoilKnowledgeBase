  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates and solum thickness ranges from about 16 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the argillic horizon is over 60 percent. Total rock fragment is less than 1 percent throughout the profile.\nUncultivated areas have A horizons with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A or Ap horizon are loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have E horizons.  Where present, the E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizons are loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. Reaction of the E horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E part of the B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the E horizon.  The B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, and chroma of 4 or 5. Reaction of the B/E horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Thin, 1/16 to 1/4 inch, gray (5Y 6/1 - 5/1) or light gray (5YR 7/1) varves or thin lenses of silts containing a high concentration of calcium carbonate are common. Reaction of the C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The small thread-like veins of deposited carbonates occurring in ped interiors and as coatings on ped surfaces are common in many pedons.  These coatings and veins have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or G; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 1."
