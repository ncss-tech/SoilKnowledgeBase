The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to redoximorphic iron concentrations is 30 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 24 to 55 inches thick and includes all of the A horizon.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent and decreases irregularly with depth (estimated).\nThe A and 2A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Chroma of 1 only occurs in the upper 20 inches.  It is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous in the surface layer and noncalcareous below.  It is loam in the upper part and loam or clay loam in the lower part with 18 to 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Organic matter is less than one percent."
