Reaction ranges from medium acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe A and C horizons, in the overwash materials, have a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.  These horizons range from 20 to 36 inches thick.\nThe Ab horizon has colors in hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam. Mottles range from none to common in shades of brown, red and yellow.\nThe Bgb and Cg horizons have colors in hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Some pedons have a few small round pebbles and pockets and streaks of loamy sand.

Bruno soils have sandy control sections.  Hatliff and Ochlockonee soils have a coarse loamy control section.  Lassiter soils have a fine-silty control section and Kemp and Nahatche soils have a fine-loamy control section."

Romayor soils formed in sandy overwash material deposited over clayey and loamy alluvium.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 48 to 52 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 70 to 84."

Ochlockonee and Bruno soils are on slightly higher positions and lack gray mottles. Hatliff soils are on similar positions and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Kaman soils are in lower positions and are clayey throughout."
