  "OVERVIEW": "The Ridd series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from gneiss, schist, and quartzite on hillsides and mountainsides. Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
