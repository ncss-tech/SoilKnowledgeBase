  "STATES": "MS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redhills series consists of very deep, well drained soils that occur on anthropogenic landforms.   This soil is developing in reconstructed mixed oxidized and unoxidized materials resulting from lignite mining operations. They are composed of randomly oriented remnants of diagnostic horizons of loamy overburden material that was excavated, mounded, and sequentially replaced following surface lignite mining operations. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
