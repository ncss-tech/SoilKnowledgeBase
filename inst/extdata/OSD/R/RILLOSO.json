  "OVERVIEW": "The Rilloso series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous rocks such as rhyolite, monzonite and andesite.  Rilloso soils are on alluvial fans and on ridges in dissected terrain with slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
