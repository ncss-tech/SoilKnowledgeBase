In dissected terrain slopes range from 0 (on ridge crests) to 10 percent on sides of ridges; fans and fan terraces commonly slope from 1 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 180 to 220 days."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This is the illustrative pedon at study area 13a in Gile, L.H., J.W.
