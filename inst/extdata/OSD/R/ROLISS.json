  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 7 to 20 inches.  These soils typically are calcareous throughout but some pedons do not have carbonates in the upper 10 inches.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The series control section contains up to 15 percent rock fragments.  In some pedons a discontinuous gravelly band up to 5 inches in thickness is in or at the base of the A or B horizon.\nTypically, an Oa horizon up to 8 inches thick is present in depressional areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. It does not have redoximorphic features in some pedons. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or fine sandy loam. An AB horizon as much as 8 inches thick is in some pedons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has distinct or prominent high chroma redoximorphic concentrations that have 10YR or redder hue. Texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or fine sandy loam. It has gypsum in some pedons. Some pedons have a 2Bg horizon.\nSome pedons have a Bkyg or 2Bkyg horizon up to 14 inches thick beginning at depths of between 16 and 30 inches that qualifies as a calcic horizon.  When present they have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe Cg or 2Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  They are stratified with 1/8 to 1/2 inch bands of clay in some pedons.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are common but may be absent in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a BCyg or 2BCyg horizon with the same range of color and texture as the C horizon.  They have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 12 to 25 percent."
