  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ralsen soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces. These soils formed in alluvium of mixed mineralogy, mainly from acid igneous rocks, with a component of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 1,700 to 3,720 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 26 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."
