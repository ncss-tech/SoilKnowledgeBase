  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches). Rock fragments comprise 0 to 5 percent of the volume of the upper part and 1 to 7 percent of the BC or C horizon. The average calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the upper 41 cm (16 inches) and 5 to 17 percent in the rest of the sola and C horizon. The average content of gypsum in the solum ranges from 5 to 25 percent with subhorizons up to 30 percent. The C horizon lacks or has up to 5 percent gypsum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 2. It is a clay loam or loam. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg or Byg horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly clay loam or loam, but subhorizons of sandy clay loam are in some pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BCg or Cg horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is friable or firm based on the geomorphic surface it occurs on."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Revere soils have slightly convex slopes on rims of depressions and on slight rises within poorly drained flats on ground moraines. Slopes gradients are 0 to 3 percent. Revere soils formed in loamy calcareous till of Wisconsinan age. Mean annual air temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 559 mm to 660 mm (22 to 26 inches)."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Surface runoff is negligible or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second (.6 to 2 inches per hour) in the upper part and 1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second (.2 to .6 inches per hour) in the firm till. The apparent seasonal high saturation is at a depth of 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 1 feet) during the wettest parts of normal years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Largely cultivated and cropped intensively to corn and soybeans. Small grain and hay are other major crops. Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture. Native vegetation is predominantly wet-site tall prairie species such as prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, wooly sedge, giant goldenrod and Canada goldenrod."
