  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Richollow series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone, dolomite, calcareous siltstone or calcareous sandstone.  Richollow soils are on north and east slopes of hills, mountains and summits. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
