  "OVERVIEW": "The Rondeau series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in highly decomposed organic soil materials from herbaceous plants and underlying limnic materials, which are mostly marl. These soils are in bogs that formerly were post glacial lakes on outwash plains and moraines. They have moderately slow to moderately rapid permeability in the organic material and very slow or slow permeability in the limnic deposits. Slope typically ranges from 0 to 1 percent but slopes to 6 percent are included for seepland areas. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to marl ranges from 16 to 51 inches. The fibers mostly are derived from herbaceous plants, but layers with Hypnum moss fibers are in some pedons. Content of woody fragments over 2 cm in size is less than 15 percent, by volume, in the organic materials. Snail shells and/or shell fragments comprise as much as 10 percent of the volume of the organic soil material in some pedons. The organic soil material contains 20 to 45 percent mineral material. The organic soil material is strongly acid to slightly alkaline. The surface tier and the organic portion of the lower tiers typically are muck (sapric material). However, mucky peat (hemic material) is as thick as 10 inches in some pedons.\nThe Oa horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2 broken face, value of 2 and chroma of 1 rubbed. Content of fiber is less than 25 percent and less than 10 percent rubbed.\nThe Oe horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3 on the broken face. There is a decrease of 1 or 2 units in value and/or chroma upon rubbing.\nThe Cg1 horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 or 2. It has low bulk density (0.1 to 0.5 gm/cc) and feels like a silt loam. Snail shells commonly are in this material and in some pedons they occupy up to 25 percent of the volume. This layer is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg2 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has low bulk density (0.05 to 0.20 gm/cc) and feels like a silt loam. It has 80 to 98 percent of mineral material and more than one-half of it is calcium carbonate. It commonly contains snail shells, and in some layers snail shells comprise up to 50 percent of the volume. Plant detritus comprises less than 10 percent of the volume. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. In some pedons it occurs as thin strata between layers of organic soil material with composite aggregate thickness of more than 2 inches."

The sloping phase has slopes ranging from 1 to 6 percent for seepland areas. They consist mostly of highly decomposed organic soil materials derived from herbaceous plants and layers of marl 2 inches or more thick within a depth of 51 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 33 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 172 days.
