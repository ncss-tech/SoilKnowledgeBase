  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to marl ranges from 16 to 51 inches. The fibers mostly are derived from herbaceous plants, but layers with Hypnum moss fibers are in some pedons. Content of woody fragments over 2 cm in size is less than 15 percent, by volume, in the organic materials. Snail shells and/or shell fragments comprise as much as 10 percent of the volume of the organic soil material in some pedons. The organic soil material contains 20 to 45 percent mineral material. The organic soil material is strongly acid to slightly alkaline. The surface tier and the organic portion of the lower tiers typically are muck (sapric material). However, mucky peat (hemic material) is as thick as 10 inches in some pedons.\nThe Oa horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2 broken face, value of 2 and chroma of 1 rubbed. Content of fiber is less than 25 percent and less than 10 percent rubbed.\nThe Oe horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3 on the broken face. There is a decrease of 1 or 2 units in value and/or chroma upon rubbing.\nThe Cg1 horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 or 2. It has low bulk density (0.1 to 0.5 gm/cc) and feels like a silt loam. Snail shells commonly are in this material and in some pedons they occupy up to 25 percent of the volume. This layer is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg2 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has low bulk density (0.05 to 0.20 gm/cc) and feels like a silt loam. It has 80 to 98 percent of mineral material and more than one-half of it is calcium carbonate. It commonly contains snail shells, and in some layers snail shells comprise up to 50 percent of the volume. Plant detritus comprises less than 10 percent of the volume. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. In some pedons it occurs as thin strata between layers of organic soil material with composite aggregate thickness of more than 2 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils typically have plane or concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 1 percent in bogs on glacial outwash plains and moraines. The sloping phase has slopes ranging from 1 to 6 percent for seepland areas. They consist mostly of highly decomposed organic soil materials derived from herbaceous plants and layers of marl 2 inches or more thick within a depth of 51 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 33 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 172 days. Elevation ranges from 670 to 1600 feet above sea level."

Cathro and Markey soils have a mineral substratum beginning within 16 to 51 inches. Haslie soils have substratums dominated with coprogenous earth deposits. Rifle and Seelyeville soils have organic materials thicker than 51 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. Runoff is low or very low. Permeability in the organic materials is moderately slow to moderately rapid and is slow or very slow in the limnic deposits. Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table for the sloping phase is 0 to 2 feet."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in native vegetation. Some is used for pasture or hay. Native vegetation is primarily sedges and grasses with scattered willow. The sloping phase may be wooded with black ash, white spruce, balsam fir, quaking aspen, and northern white cedar as primary tree species."
