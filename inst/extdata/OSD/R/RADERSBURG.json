  "OVERVIEW": "The Radersburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan remnants, and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
