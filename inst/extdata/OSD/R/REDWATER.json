  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel-size limestone and range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and B horizons and from 0 to 50 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Chroma of 2 when present do not dominate the horizon.  It is most commonly fine sandy loam and less commonly loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Thin subhorizons of silt loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand are in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2 through 4.  Chroma of 2 does not dominate the horizon if it occurs above a depth of 20 inches.  It is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction.  It is commonly stratified.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redwater soils are on flood plains adjacent to low gradient streams and rivers.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These rivers, since the retreat of Wisconsin ice, have cut down through layers of glacial drift and lacustrine or marine sediments so that further down-cutting is deterred by bedrock in the stream bottoms.  The soils formed in post-glacial alluvium derived predominantly from sandstone, dolomitic limestone, and less commonly gneiss and marble.  Redwater soils flood commonly for brief durations.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches.  The growing season ranges from 120 to 150 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adams, Adjidaumo, and Croghan soils.  The Adams and Croghan soils are in sandy families and are on natural levees next to larger streams and rivers.  The Adjidaumo soils are in a fine family and are in back water areas that remain ponded after the flood waters have receded."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: a.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 30 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Fluvaquentic Eutrochrept feature - there are mottles with 2 chroma at 7 inches.  Strata indicate an irregular distribution of carbon with depth.  The colors have higher values in the lower B horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
