  "OVERVIEW": "The Rominell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
