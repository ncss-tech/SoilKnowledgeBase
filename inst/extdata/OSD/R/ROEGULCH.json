  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Roegulch series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and hillslopes. Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
