  "OVERVIEW": "The Redspoon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Redspoon soils are on pediments in intermontane basins.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
