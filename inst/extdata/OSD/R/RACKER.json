  "OVERVIEW": "The Racker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash material with a mantle of volcanic ash. Racker soils are on outwash terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The upper 10 to l3 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass of 30 to 60 percent, Alox plus  Feox of 1.o to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent.[SW3]\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.[SW4]\nThe AB horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist.
