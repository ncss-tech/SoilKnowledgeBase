These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice. Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 33 inches. The upper 10 to l3 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass of 30 to 60 percent, Alox plus  Feox of 1.o to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent.[SW3]\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.[SW4]\nThe AB horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Racker soils are on outwash terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in glacial outwash with a mantle of volcanic ash and an influence of stream alluvium[SW6]. Elevations are l1,800 to 2,500 feet. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 67 degrees F. and the average annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 150 to 175 days and the frost-free season is 85 to 120 days."
