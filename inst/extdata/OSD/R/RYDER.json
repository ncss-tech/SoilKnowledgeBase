    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Bolton, Bookwood, Carpenter, Renox and Washington series are in the same family. Bolton soils formed in material weathered from interbedded limestone and sandstone bedrock on mountain side slopes. Bookwood soils are moderately deep and well drained soils that formed from residuum derived from interbedded limestone and shale. Carpenter soils formed in moderately permeable loamy colluvium over slowly permeable residuum of weathered shale or siltstone. Renox sols are very deep and formed in loamy colluvium or alluvium from interbedded siltstone, shale, limestone, and sandstone. Washington soils formed in old glacial drift (pre-Wisconsin Age) or colluvium derived mainly from limestone and granitic gneiss.\nArcola, Athol, Brecknock, Caribel, Cateache, Culleoka, Door, Duffield, Dumfries, Ebbing, Fredericktown, Frondorf, Grayford, Hayter, Kell, Lamotte, Legore, Loudonville, Manassas, Mechanicsburg, Middleburg, Morrison, Myersville, Neshaminy, Oatlands, Panorama, Pasturerock, Penn, Spriggs, Sudley, Weedmark Westmoreland, Wheeling, and Williamsburg soils are in a related families. Arcola soils have hues redder than 7.5YR throughout solum and substratum. Athol and Penn soils have Bt horizons with hues redder than 7.5YR. Brecknock soils have solum thickness of less than 40 inches and depth to bedrock of less than 60 inches. Caribel, Hayter, Manassas, Middleburg, Neshaminy, Panorama and Sudley, soils all have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches. Cateache, Culleoka, Frondorf, Loudonville, Mechanicsburg, Penn, and Spriggs series have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of less than 4O inches. Cateache soils have hues redder than 7.5YR below the surface horizons. Culleoka soils do not have rock fragments of weathered limestone and quartzite. Door soils have a mollic epipedon from 10 to 20 inches. Duffield soils are formed in residuum of impure limestone. Dumfries soils have a higher mean annual temperature and also have bedrock at greater than 20 feet. Ebbing soils have hue of 7.5YR or browner in the lower part of the series control section. Fredericktown soils formed in early Wisconsian or Illinoian age outwash, with or without a thin loess mantle, on stream terraces and kame terraces.  Frondorf soils are very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the soil, and have rock fragments dominantly of sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Grayford and Lamotte soils have a loess capping. Kell soils are more acid than moderately acid in the lower one-fourth of the control section. Legore, Myersville, and Westmoreland soils have solum thickness of less than 40 inches. Legore soils have rock fragments dominated by diabase or diorite and saprolite within a depth of 40 inches. Loudonville soils have erratics and rock fragments are dominantly of sandstone. Mechanicsburg soils have a lithologic discontinuity between 20 and 40 inches. Morrison soils formed in residuum of weathered noncalcareous sedimentary rock and have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt2 horizon. Oatlands soils have rock fragments of conglomerate. Pasturerock soils are very deep to bedrock and in the particle-size control section have 5 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. Spriggs soils have saprolite and/or hornblende lithologies immediately below the paralithic contact. Weedmark soils developed from gneiss schist and granite. Wheeling soils have C horizons of stratified very fine sand or sand with up to 65 percent rock fragments on river terraces. Williamsburg soils are formed in a thin mantle of loess and in stratified outwash of silty and loamy material with some gravel on high stream terraces."
