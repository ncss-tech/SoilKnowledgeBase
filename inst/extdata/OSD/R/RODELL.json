  "OVERVIEW": "The Rodell series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residual material derived from granitic rocks.  The Rodell soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
