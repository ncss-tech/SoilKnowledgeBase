The effective cation exchange capacity typically ranges from 10 to 30 percent or more saturated with exchangeable hydrogen.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6, or hue of 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Silt coatings are on major structural surfaces. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include Dubbs, Gallion, Memphis, and Siwell of the same family and Dexter and Hebert in similar families. All of these soils lack silt coatings in the major part of the Bt horizon. In addition, Dexter soils have lower base saturation. Dubbs soils have colors of 10YR and 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Gallion soils are medium acid to moderately alkaline in the B horizon. Hebert soils have gray ped coatings dominant in the Bt horizon. Memphis soils have less than about 10 percent total sand throughout and Bt horizons that are 7.5YR or yellower. Siwell soils have clayey 2Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rilla soils occur mainly on level to gently sloping natural levees of the Red River and along present and abandoned channels of the Arkansas River. They have formed in silty alluvium of mixed mineralogy. The climate is warm and humid. Average annual rainfall ranges from about 45 to 55 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 70 degrees F. Annual Thornthwaite P-E index is 68 to 74."
