  "OVERVIEW": "The Rilla series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in reddish silty and loamy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping natural levees along the Red River and the present and abandoned channels of the Arkansas River. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
