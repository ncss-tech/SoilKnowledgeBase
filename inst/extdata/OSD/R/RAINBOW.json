  "OVERVIEW": "The Rainbow series consists of moderately well drained loamy soils formed in silty mantled lodgement till.  The soils are very deep to bedrock and moderately deep to a densic contact.  They are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on till plains, hills and drumlins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the surface layer and subsoil, and low to moderately high in the dense substratum.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 40 inches. Depth to the densic contact commonly ranges from 20 to 40 inches but the range currently includes 18 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 6 feet.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the substratum.  Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded gravel and typically make up 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A horizon centers on silt loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction, but includes loam high in silt.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon below the A horizon.  It has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture, structure, and consistence are like the A horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Iron depletions are within a depth of 24 inches.  The Bw horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand.  It has weak granular or subangular blocky structure, or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin BC horizon.\nSome pedons have an E horizon up to 3 inches thick below the B horizon.  It has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 2 or 3, and has redoximorphic features. Typically, it is coarser-textured than the overlying horizon.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y and value and chroma of 2 to 6.  It typically has redoximorphic features.  Texture ranges from loam to sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  The horizon has weak or moderate, medium to very thick plates, or it is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chautauqua, Pittstown, Pompton, Sutton, Wapping, Watchaug, Wilbraham and Woodbridge soils. Chautauqua, Sutton, Wapping, and Watchaug soils do not have a densic contact. Pittstown soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the substratum. Pompton soils are wetter with iron depletions throughout the B horizon. Poorly drained Wilbraham soils have iron depletions throughout the B horizon. Woodbridge soils have less than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand in the solum."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rainbow soils are nearly level to strongly sloping and are on till plains, hills, and drumlins.  Slope commonly ranges from 0 to 8 percent but the range includes 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in a silty mantled acid till derived mainly from gneiss, schist, sandstone, conglomerate, and basalt.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 120 to 190 days."

The well drained Broadbrook soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Agawam, Enfield, Haven, Merrimac, and Tisbury soils are on nearby outwash terraces and are underlain by stratified sand and gravel. Birchwood and Poquonock soils have coarse-textured solums. Bridgehampton and Scio soils are coarse-silty and do not have a dense substratum. Canton, Charlton, Cheshire, and Narragansett soils are well drained and do not have a dense substratum. Hollis soils have bedrock within a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Leicester, Ridgebury, and Stissing soils are poorly drained. Newport and Paxton soils are well drained. Scituate soils have a loamy sand substratum. Wethersfield soils are well drained and have 5YR or redder hue in the B horizon."

Cation exchange activity class placement determined from a review of limited lab data and similar or associated soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon);\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 26 inches (Bw horizon);\n3.  Aquic feature - iron depletions are within a 24 inch depth (Bw2 horizon);\n4.  Lithologic discontinuity at a depth of 26 inches (2Cd horizon);\n5.  Dense till substratum - the zone from 26 to 65 inches (2Cd horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
