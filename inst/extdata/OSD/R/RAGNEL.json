  "OVERVIEW": "The Ragnel series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Ragnel soils are on barrier beaches and longshore bars. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Malaga soils are noncalcareous throughout, are slightly acid to slightly alkaline and lack significant summer precipitation. McConnel soils average 60 to 80 percent gravel in the particle-size control section and are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer. McNye soils contain 50 to 85 percent rock fragments dominated by cobbles and are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer. Mcwatt soils are 43 to 74 cm deep to indentifiable secondary calcium carbonates, are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact, and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms."
