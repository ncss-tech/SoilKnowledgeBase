  "REVDATE": "06/2009",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Riverston series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loamy alluvium over outwash. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",
