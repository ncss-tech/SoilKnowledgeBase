  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  A dense weakly cemented layer immediately underlies the duripan.  It has more than 15 percent coarse plus very coarse sand.  The soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil, at depth of 7 to 24 inches or the duripan, is dry in all parts from June to November unless irrigated and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 5YR 6/4, 5/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/6, 5/4; 10YR 6/3, 5/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4; 10YR 4/3 or 3/3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe BAt horizon when present has dry color of 5YR 6/3; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4; or 10YR 5/3.  Moist color is 5YR 4/4, 3/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4; or 10YR 3/4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with slightly more clay than the A horizon.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 5YR 5/6, 5/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 4/6 or 4/4.  Moist color is 5YR 4/6, 4/4, 3/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4; or 2.5YR 3/4.   Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay, but averaging less than 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Some pedons may contain up to 5 percent gravel.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bqm horizon has dry color of 5YR 6/8, 6/6, 5/6, 5/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 6/6 or 6/4.  Moist color is 5YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 3/4; or 7.5YR 4/4.  It is strongly cemented to indurated.  This hardpan may be irregularly interrupted by weakly cemented material or occasionally may be absent with \"windows\" filled with coarse textured material.\nThe BCq horizon has similar color and reaction as the Bqm horizons.  The weak silica cementation is dense and brittle, but not a duripan, and crushes to a sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or fine sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buchenau, Exeter, Fiddyment and Monserate series.  Buchenau soils are calcareous throughout and have variable amounts of salt and sodium. Exeter soils lack any cementation below the thin duripan and lack moderately developed subangular blocky Bt horizons.  Fiddyment and Monserate soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in old alluvium from granitic rock sources.  The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F; mean July temperature is 78 to 82 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 230 to 300 days."
