    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rixie soils are on flood plains, stream terraces and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources of mostly volcanic origin with an influence from volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 1,310 to 1,460 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8.9 to 9.4 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
