  "OVERVIEW": "The Rixie series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources mostly of volcanic origin with an influence from volcanic ash.  The Rixie soils are on flood plains, stream terraces and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
