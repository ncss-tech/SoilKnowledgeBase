  "OVERVIEW": "The Rofiss series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soil formed in alluvium derived dominately from shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
