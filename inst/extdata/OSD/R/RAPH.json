  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Burnswick series. Burnswick soils are moist more than 20 days cumulative in the summer months.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Raph soils are on nearly level fan remnants, beach plains, alluvial plains, fan skirts, lake plains, and alluvial flats.  These soils formed in stratified alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,410 to 1,950 meters. Mean annual precipitation is between 150 and 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is about 100 to 120 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Katelana and Heist series.  Both these soils lack cambic horizons.\nDRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nUSE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used primarily for livestock grazing.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, winterfat, bud sagebrush and bottlebrush squirreltail.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  MLRA 28B.  The series is not extensive.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California\nSERIES ESTABLISHED:  White Pine County, Nevada, 1990.\nREMARKS:  Series originally was recognized in Lincoln County but type location has been moved from Lincoln to White Pine County to an area more nearly representing the central concept of the series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 18 cm. (An and part of Bwn horizons)\nCambic horizon - The zone from about 10 to 36 cm. (Bwn horizon)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm.
