  "OVERVIEW": "The Rousseau series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits on dunes, lake plains, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",

Duel and Ishpeming soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). East Lake, Kiva, and Sayner soils have more than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Hartwick soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Karlin soils do not have dominant texture of fine sand throughout the series control section. Rubicon soils average less than 50 percent fine sand throughout the series control section. Sultz soils are stratified with loamy and sandy textures in the lower part of the series control section."
