Duel and Ishpeming soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). East Lake, Kiva, and Sayner soils have more than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Hartwick soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Karlin soils do not have dominant texture of fine sand throughout the series control section. Rubicon soils average less than 50 percent fine sand throughout the series control section. Sultz soils are stratified with loamy and sandy textures in the lower part of the series control section."

Rousseau soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 8.3 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F)."

The moderately well drained Neconish soils and the somewhat poorly drained Wainola soils are in slightly lower landscape positions, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Deford soils are in depressions and drainageways. The Neconish, Wainola and Deford soils form a drainage sequence with the Rousseau soils."
