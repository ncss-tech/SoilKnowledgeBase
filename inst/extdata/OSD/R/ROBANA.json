  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 16 to 36 inches thick, depth to calcareous material exceeds 60 inches, and the solum exceeds 50 inches thick. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from about .8 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with depth. The soil is 80 to 100 percent base-saturated. Content of coarse fragments is typically less than 1 percent and ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F. The\nA horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3. It usually has granular or crumb primary structure, but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft to slightly hard and slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has prismatic primary structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is usually heavy silt loam or light silty clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 40 to 70 percent, and sand from 5 to 30 percent with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

Greybo soils have horizons containing lamellae. Halfcircle soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Lanark soils have a calcic horizon. Pinebutte soils are deep to a lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Robana soils are on gently to moderately sloping upland hills and ridges. Slopes usually range from 0 to about 15 percent. These soils formed in thick noncalcareous or weakly calcareous aeolian parent materials. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation occurring during most months. The mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 58 degrees F."
