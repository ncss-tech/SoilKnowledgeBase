These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers.  The climate is subhumid with cold wet winters and warm relatively dry summers.  Elevation is 530 to 860 meters. The average annual precipitation is 625 to 825 mm, and average annual air temperature is 5.6 to 7.8 degrees C. The average frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
