  "OVERVIEW": "The Rubson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers. Rubson soils are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 775 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
