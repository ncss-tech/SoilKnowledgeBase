  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosston series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level playa floors, and closed drainage depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 13.9 degrees C (57 degrees F).",
