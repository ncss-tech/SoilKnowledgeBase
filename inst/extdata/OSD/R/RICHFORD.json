Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 30  to 50 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 30 percent in the Bt and C horizons. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 8 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral throughout the soil. Carbonates are absent to a depth of 60 inches or more. The argillic horizon averages between 6 and 12 percent clay and between 75 and 85 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR,  and value and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to  6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is typically loamy sand, but in some pedons it is sand.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand or gravelly sand."
