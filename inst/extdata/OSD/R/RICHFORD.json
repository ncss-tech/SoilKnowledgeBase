  "REVDATE": "06/2005",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Richford series consists of very deep, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy and loamy outwash on stream terraces and outwash plains, and in a few places on valley benches.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy layers and moderately rapid in the loamy layer. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees  F.",

Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 30  to 50 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 30 percent in the Bt and C horizons. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 8 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral throughout the soil. Carbonates are absent to a depth of 60 inches or more. The argillic horizon averages between 6 and 12 percent clay and between 75 and 85 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR,  and value and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to  6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is typically loamy sand, but in some pedons it is sand.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand or gravelly sand."
