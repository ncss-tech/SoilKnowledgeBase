  "OVERVIEW": "The Roto series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from limestone.  These soils are on sedimentary uplands, mountains, strath terraces and structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
