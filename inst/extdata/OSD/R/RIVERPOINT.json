  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Riverpoint soils are gently sloping to moderately steep on shoulders and risers of relict lakebed terraces and convex areas of fan remnants at elevations of 2,950 to 3,900 feet. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rocks (dominantly granodiorite) mixed with lacustrine sediments in the upper part. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
