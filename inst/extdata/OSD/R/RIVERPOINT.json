  "OVERVIEW": "The Riverpoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks mixed with lacustrine sediments in the upper part. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent in mountain valleys and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
