  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rohrersville soils occupy concave upland flats, drainage heads, lower footslopes, and the courses of intermittent drains in the northern part of the Blue Ridge.  Drainageways are subject to frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding events with little or no deposition or erosion. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in local colluvium and alluvial materials over residuum from metaigneous rocks, chiefly metabasalt and metaandesite.  The climate is temperate and humid, with a mean annual temperature of 45 to 55 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation of 35 to 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Catoctin, Fauquier, Highfield, Lantz, Lew, Meadowville, Mt. Zion, Myersville, Trego, Ravenrock, and Thurmont series.  The Catoctin, Fauquier, Highfield, Lew, Myersville, and Thurmont soils are well drained.  Mt. Zion and Trego soils are moderately well drained and Lantz is very poorly drained.  The Lantz soils are in upland depressions.  Ravenrock soils have wet substrata.  Thurmont soils are on colluvial fans, benches, and stream terraces.  The rest of these associated soils occupy higher positions on the landscape than the Rohrersville soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was originally classified as an Aeric Fragiaqualfs.  Since the fragipan was hard to find, the series was reclassified as an Aquic Hapludalfs in 1995.  The Seventh Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy allows classification as a Fragiaquic Hapludalfs, a change made in 1997.\n02/2005 added statement about frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding in the geographic setting.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1)  Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 15 to 55 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btx, and Btxg horizons).\n2)  Fragic material - the zone from approximately 31 to 55 inches (Btx and Btxg horizons).\n3)  Redoximorphic depletions below 15 inches.\nAdditional Data:  The sample number for this pedon is S94MD-021-07.  Data available is Univ. of MD PSDA.  Similar pedons within 3 miles on similar geologic material are S94MD-021-4 and S94MD-021-6, both of which have full characterization from the NSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
