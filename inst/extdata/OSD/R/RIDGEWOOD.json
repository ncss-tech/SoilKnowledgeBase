  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Content of silt plus clay is less than 5 percent between depths of 10 to 40 inches.  The soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in all horizons.  Texture is sand or fine sand throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral (N) with these values.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8, or value of 4, and chroma of 3.  Chromas above 2 are generally in the upper part above a depth of 40 inches.  Redox features in various shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray occur in areas where the water table fluctuates and within 1 meter of the surface."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Corolla and Ousley series in the same family and Chipley, Ortega, Osier, and Pactolus soils in closely similar families.  Corolla soils are affected by ocean salt spray and do not support trees.  Ousley and Osier soils periodically flood.  In addition, Osier soils are poorly drained.  Chipley and Pactolus soils are in coated families.  Ortega soils are moderately well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ridgewood soils normally occur in nearly level to sloping landscapes.  Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments.  The mean annual temperature is about 65 to 70 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches."

Albany and Plummer soils have a Bt horizon at depths of 40 to 80 inches.  Hurricane, Leon, Mandarin, and Pottsburg soils have Bh horizons.  In addition Plummer, Leon, and Pottsburg soils are poorly drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Rapid permeability.  Slow runoff.  The water table is 24 to 40 inches for 2 to 4 months or more during most years.  It rises to depths of 15 to 24 inches for brief periods of less than 3 weeks.  It is below a depth of 40 inches when extremely dry."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Ridgewood soils are in natural vegetation.  Natural vegetation is a forest of slash and longleaf pine, water, laurel, and live oaks, and scattered turkey oak.  The understory consists of waxmyrtle, bluestems, sumac, blue maidencane, blackberry, gallberry, scattered sawpalmetto, some wiregrass, and other grasses.  Some areas have been cleared and are in pasture."
