  "OVERVIEW": "The Raleigh series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in materials derived from weathered granitic rocks.  Raleigh soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
