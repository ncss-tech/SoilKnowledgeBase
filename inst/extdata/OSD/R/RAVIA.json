  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The content of coarse fragments less than 3 inches in diameter ranges by volume from 0 to 30 percent in the A horizon, from 10 to 30 percent in the textural control section and from 30 to 90 percent below the textural control section.\nThe A horizon ranges from dark grayish brown to brown in hues of 10YR through 5YR, with values of 4 or 5 and chromas of 2 or 3.  It is loam or sandy loam with gravelly analogies and is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BA, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons range in color from light grayish brown through reddish brown in hues of 10YR through 5YR, values of 4 through 6 and chromas of 2 through 6.  Chromas of 2 occur below a depth of 40 inches.  These horizons in some pedons are mottled in shades of brown, red and yellow.  These horizons are loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam with a clay content ranging from 25 to 35 percent in the BA and Bt1 horizons and up to 40 percent in the Bt2 horizon.  The BA and Bt1 horizons range from slightly\nacid through strongly acid and the Bt2 horizon ranges from neutral through moderately acid.  The Bt3 horizon has colors similar to the Bt horizons above but generally is grayer and more mottled.  It has similar textures and its reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has shades of gray, brown, red or yellow, or it is mottled in these shades.  It is gravelly or very gravelly counterparts of clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam, containing by volume from 40 to 90 percent weathered granite fragments.  It ranges from neutral through slightly alkaline."
