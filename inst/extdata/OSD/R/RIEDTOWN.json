    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to the buried soil ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The A horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral, except in limed areas.  The Bw, B/Eb, and Bgb horizons range from medium acid to moderately alkaline.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay.  Below the A and Bw horizons, brown and black concretions, if present, are few to many.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4; mottles, if present, are few to common in shades of gray or brown.  It is silt loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, with mottles in shades of brown and gray, or it is mottled in these colors.  It is silt loam or loam.  The E part is seams of grayish silt or silt coatings between and on the faces of prisms.\nThe Bgb horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of brown.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Bruin soils are the only competing series in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Adler, Coushatta, Marietta, McRaven, Oaklimeter, and Thenas series. Bruin soils do not have a buried solum and have a C horizon that is weakly stratified.  Adler soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Coushatta soils do not have grayish mottles within a depth of 24 inches and have a fine-silty particle-size class.  Marietta soils have a fine-loamy particle-size class and siliceous mineralogy.  McRaven have a grayish matrix within a depth of 20 inches.  Oaklimeter soils are very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Thenas soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Riedtown soils are on flood plains and low terraces that are subject to flooding unless protected.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These are nearly level soils that formed in silty alluvium along streams that drain areas of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area. The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit and the annual precipitation is about 57 inches."

The well drained Adler soils are mainly in slightly higher areas bordering channels.  The somewhat poorly drained McRaven soils commonly are in slightly lower areas and depressions.  The somewhat poorly drained Belden soils, which have a fine-silty particle-size class, are in slightly lower positions, and commonly farther back from the channel."

The water table is within about 1.5 to 3.5 feet of the surface during seasons of high rainfall.  These soils are subject to rare, occasional, or frequent flooding of brief duration, unless protected."

Some areas are wooded; common trees include eastern cottonwood, green ash, American sycamore, water oak, willow oak, yellow-poplar, cherrybark oak, loblolly pine, and sweetgum."
