  "OVERVIEW": "The Robbscreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent in foothills and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
