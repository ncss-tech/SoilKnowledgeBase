  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rexmont series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from limestone on mountain slopes and ridgetops. Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to bedrock range from 8 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section hue 18 to 27 percent clay.  Rock fragments in the particle size control section are angular and range from 35 to 60 percent, 25 to 40 percent as pebbles and 0 to 35 percent as cobbles.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The soil is usually dry, but is moist in all parts of the moisture control section 45 to 60 consecutive days or more during the 4 months after the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon is gravelly loam in the upper part and very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam in the lower part.  It has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous."

Agassiz soils are slightly acid or mildly alkaline.  Anatone, Bocker and Foxol soils have hue redder than 10YR and are neutral or slightly acid.  Cedaran and Little Pole soils have a cambic horizon.  Falula soils have hue of 2.5YR or redder and have a Bk horizon.  Grando soils have a Bk horizon.  Swanner soils have a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Van Wagoner soils have a sandy loam particle size control section and are neutral to medium acid in the control section."
