  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruko series consists of shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from shale.  They are on sideslopes of hills and mountains.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 90 cumulative days or more in 7 out of 10 years in some subhorizons between depths of 4 and 12 inches, but are not continuously dry in all parts between these depths for as long as 60 consecutive days.  The clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly calcareous or strongly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  This horizon is strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous."
