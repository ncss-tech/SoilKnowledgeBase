The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 90 cumulative days or more in 7 out of 10 years in some subhorizons between depths of 4 and 12 inches, but are not continuously dry in all parts between these depths for as long as 60 consecutive days.  The clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly calcareous or strongly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  This horizon is strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous."

The average annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 100 days.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."

Podo soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches and are on similar positions.  Syrett soils have a mollic epipedon, are not shallow and are on benches."
