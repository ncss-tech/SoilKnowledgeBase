They formed in volcanic ash and pumice, are excessively drained and have a xeric moisture regime.  Wickiup soils are in nearby depressions.  They are poorly drained, average greater than 35 percent pumice paragravel in the particle-size control section and have common or many redox accumulations within 5 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Chocknott soils are on nearby alluvial fans, stream terraces and drainageways.  They are poorly drained and have an umbric epipedon."
