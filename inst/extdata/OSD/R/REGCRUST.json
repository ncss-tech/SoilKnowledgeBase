  "OVERVIEW": "The Regcrust series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on alluvial fans and in drainageways of a lava plateau.  These soils formed in alluvium from ash and pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

They are poorly drained, average greater than 35 percent pumice paragravel in the particle-size control section and have common or many redox accumulations within 5 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Chocknott soils are on nearby alluvial fans, stream terraces and drainageways.  They are poorly drained and have an umbric epipedon."
