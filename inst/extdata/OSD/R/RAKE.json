  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rake soils are as shallow as 12 inches and as deep as 20 inches over an indurated lime-cemented hardpan. The mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick. The solum contains 40 to 60 percent coarse fragments. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to  52 degrees F., and the average summer temperature ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F. The soils are not usually, dry, but are dry in the 7 to 20 inch section for more than 45 consecutive days. The soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay loam with less than 35 percent clay.  This horizon ranges from slightly calcareous to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bkm horizon has several indurated layers 1 to 5 inches thick with roots between the layers.\nThe Ck horizon is sandy loam to loamy fine sand and has 50 to 70 percent rock fragments. Limestone bedrock occurs below the hardpan in some pedons."

They formed in colluvium and local alluvium derived from limestone and minor amounts of quartzite. The climate is dry subhumid. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 F. Average summer temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
