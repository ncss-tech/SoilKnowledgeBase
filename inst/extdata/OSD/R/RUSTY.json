  "OVERVIEW": "The Rusty series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments reworked by wind.  The sediments are from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
