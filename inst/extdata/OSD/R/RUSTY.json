    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rusty soils are on lake plains at elevations of 1,250 to 1,340 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in lacustrine sediments reworked by wind.  The sediments are derived from mixed parent materials.  The climate is warm, continental arid, with mean annual precipitation of 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C.; the frost-free season ranges from l20 to l40 days."
