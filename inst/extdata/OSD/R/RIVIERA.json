  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 35 to 65 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A and E horizon, from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the B/E, Btg, and BC horizons, and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the 2C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3.  Horizons with value of 3.5 or less are less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bt/E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value 5 or 6. Tongues and interfingers of sand or fine sand from the E horizon extend into it.  In some places, small bodies of pyrites are in the horizon.  When drained, sulfates are released in these areas and the reaction decreases to extremely acid in localized spots. Texture of the B part is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam and texture of the E part is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C or 2C horizon has colors similar to the BC horizon.  It is a mixture of sand and shell fragments or a mixture of shell fragments and marl.  Texture ranges from sand to fine sandy loam."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Riviera soils are on broad, low flats, flatwoods and in depressions in the Southern Flatwoods (MLRA 155) and the Southern Florida Lowlands (MLRA 156B).  They formed in stratified sandy and loamy marine sediments.  The climate is humid semitropical.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 74 to 76 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 58 to 65 inches."

Boca and Hallandale soils are poorly or very poorly drained and are on similar positions.  In addition, Boca soils are moderately deep to limestone bedrock and Hallandale soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  Bradenton and Parkwood soils are on similar to lower positions, and have an argillic horizon within depths of 20 inches from the surface. In addition, Parkwood soils have calcareous argillic horizons.  The very poorly drained Chobee and Manatee soils are on similar to lower positions and have mollic epipedons.  The poorly or very poorly drained Holopaw and Malabar soils are on similar to lower positions but are grossarenic.  The poorly or very poorly drained Immokalee, Myakka, Oldsmar, and Wabasso soils are on similar positions but have spodic horizons.  The very poorly drained Pompano soils are on similar to lower positions and are sandy throughout."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Riviera soils formerly were included in the Felda series.  The Genesis of these soils is not clear.  Part of the tonguing of the B&A horizon could have formed under marine environment as a result of loading of sands on unconsolidated more clayey sediments.\nThe water table is within 10 inches of the surface for 2 to 4 months in most years and 10 to 30 inches deep most of the rest of the year.  It is below 40 inches for short periods in driest seasons.  Some areas are flooded for periods ranging from a few days to about 3 months.  Depressions are ponded for periods ranging from 6 to 12 months.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 inches (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from a depth of 6 inches to a depth of 28 inches (the E horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 28 inches to a depth of 42 inches (Bt/E and Btg horizons).\nGlossic feature - the tongues of sand (E) extending into the argillic horizon (Bt/E horizon).\nRiviera soils are in MLRAs 155 and 156B.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
