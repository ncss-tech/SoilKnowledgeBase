Texture is silt loam or the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or sand. Rock fragments in individual horizons range from 10 to 90 percent. Thin strata of very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam can be within 60 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly alkaline."
