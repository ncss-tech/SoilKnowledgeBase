    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft shale, siltstone or mudstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, silt loam or cobbly loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay or silty clay and typically averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a thin Bw horizon below the Bt horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 4 or less.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam or clay.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bky, BCk or BCky horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is soft platy alkaline shale, siltstone or mudstone which is stratified with silty layers in some pedons.  Some pedons have a C horizon above the Cr horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bearpaw, Cerro, Dutton, Linnet, Mondamin and Savage series.  Bearpaw, Cerro, Linnet, Mondamin and Savage soils do not have bedrock within depths of 40 inches. In addition, Cerro soils are stony below a depth of 26 inches and are above elevations of 6000 feet.  Dutton soils occur in areas of lower precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Regent soils are on level to very steep, long and plane or slightly convex slopes on uplands.  The slope gradients commonly are 2 to 4 percent but range from 0 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from alkaline soft shale, siltstone or mudstone. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches.   Elevation ranges from 1600 to 3600 feet above mean sea level.  Average frost-free period ranges from 110 to 135 days."

Savage, Grail and Rhoades soils commonly are on lower, less sloping areas than Regent soils.  In addition, Savage soils are on terraces of nearby stream valleys and Grail soils are in concave swales and on fans.  Grail soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and do not have paralithic beds within a depth of 40 inches.  Rhoades soils have a natric horizon with strong columnar structure.  Moreau soils are on steeper convex slopes.  They do not have an argillic horizon.  Morton soils are on nearby landscapes.  They are fine-silty."
