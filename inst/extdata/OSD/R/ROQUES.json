  "OVERVIEW": "The Roques series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from shale.  Roques soils are on valley sides and alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm.",
