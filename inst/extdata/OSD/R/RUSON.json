  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from shale.  Ruson soils are on valley floors with slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Similar soils in southern Colorado with 14 to 17 inches of ppt are classified as \"Aridic Ustic\"."
