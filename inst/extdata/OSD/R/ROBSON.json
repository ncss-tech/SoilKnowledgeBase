These soils formed in residuum derived from tuffs, basalt, rhyolite, andesite and other related igneous rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,555 to 2,565 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 250 to 450 mm, average annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 90 days."

Anawalt soils are clayey, Softscrabble soils are very deep with a mollic epipedon and 27 to 35 percent clay in their particle-size control section.  Walti soils are moderately deep to bedrock, have a mollic epipedon and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section."
