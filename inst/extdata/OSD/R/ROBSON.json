  "OVERVIEW": "The Robson series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from igneous rock.  Robson soils are on hill and mountain crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 250 to 450 mm, average annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 90 days."

Anawalt soils are clayey, Softscrabble soils are very deep with a mollic epipedon and 27 to 35 percent clay in their particle-size control section.
