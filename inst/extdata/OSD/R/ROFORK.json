  "OVERVIEW": "The Rofork series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained and well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks, schist, and gneiss.  Rofork soils are on mountain slopes and structural benches.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
