Organic matter is 1.0 to 2.5 percent to a depth of 20 inches and decreases regularly with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3. It is loam or shaly loam and is 18 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent shale.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, and 6/2 or 6/3 in the lower part.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is shaly loam or shaly clay loam, has 18 to 35 percent clay content, and 15 to 35 percent shale.  Structure is weak coarse subangular blocky or the soil is massive.
