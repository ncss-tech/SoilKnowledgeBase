    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roman soils are on mountains, footslopes, and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist rocks with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is cold, with cool moist summers and cold wet winters.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches.  The average frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
