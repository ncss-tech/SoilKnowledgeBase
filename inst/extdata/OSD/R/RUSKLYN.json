  "STATES": "ND,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rusklyn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty material over glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately slow in the underlying glacial till.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches in thickness.  The soil typically is calcareous throughout, but some pedons do not have carbonates to a depth of 5 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Some pedons have a few granitic cobbles and pebbles on the surface and throughout the profile.  Mottles inherent to the parent material are in the lower Bk, C, and 2C horizons.  The depth to loamy glacial till ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  A gravel layer 1 to 5 inches in thickness is at the contact of the glacial till substratum in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 (4 to 7 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly to strongly alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonate.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 (5 to 7 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have few to common accumulations of carbonate.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 (5 to 7 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay loam or loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Some pedons do not have 2C horizons."

The Barnes, Buse, and Forman soils are on adjacent glacial till plains and have a fine-loamy control section.  The moderately well drained Brookings and Waubay soils are in swales.  They have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.  Kranzburg, Poinsett, and Vienna soils do not have carbonates above a depth of 14 inches.  Kranzburg, Poinsett, and Vienna soils are on lower landscape positions with plane surfaces.  The poorly drained Oldham and Parnell soils have a fine textured series control section and are in depressions."
