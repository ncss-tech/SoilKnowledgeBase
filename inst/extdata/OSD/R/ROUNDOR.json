  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Roundor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous materials derived from weakly consolidated sandy and silty sedimentary beds or in alluvium over the sedimentary beds.  These soils are on escarpments, sedimentary plains, hills and strath terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
