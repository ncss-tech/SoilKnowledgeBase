Als soils are noncalcareous above 40 inches. Ecklund and Tipper soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Hawsley soils are leached of carbonates at the surface; Kawich soils have a pyroclastic influence. Tipperary and Tricera soils mean annual temperatures are less than 50 degrees F. Kewake soils have soil temperatures of 47 to 53 degrees F. Sheppard soils have hues of 7.5YR through 2.5YR. Stumble soils have strata with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Sundown soils have a pyroclastic influence. Yenrab soils have exchangeable sodium contents of 20 to 50 percent below a depth of 12 inches. Additionally, the Als, Hawsley, Isolde, Kawich, Kewake, Sundown and Yenrab have cool moist winters and hot dry summers and are not intermittently moist 10-20 days in the summer.  Tipper and Tipperary receive most of their moisture in the spring and early summer and are moist in the SMCS in April, May and early June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Razito soils are on stable dunes of undulating plateaus, mesas, cuestas, valley sides and valley floors. They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived dominantly from Cretaceous sandstone. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 3,150 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 180 days."

Benally and Huerfano soils have natric horizons and are deep and shallow respectively, on areas of soft, sodium-rich bedrock. Doak soils are fine-loamy with argillic horizons on lower-lying areas of undulating plateaus. Fruitland soils are coarse-loamy and occur on low fan terraces. Mayqueen and Shiprock soils are coarse-loamy and have argillic horizons. Nageezi soils are coarse-loamy with cambic and calcic horizons on higher portions of undulating plateaus and high stream terraces."
