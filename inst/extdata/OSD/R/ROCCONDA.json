These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, rhyolite, siltstone and phyllite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,400 to 2,000 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
