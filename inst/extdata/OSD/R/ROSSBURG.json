    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rossburg soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium derived from Wisconsinan age drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 152 to 335 meters (500 to 1100 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eel, Flatrock, Fox, Genesee, Knoxdale, Landes, Medway, Shoals, Sloan, and Stonelick soils. Eel, Flatrock, Fox, Genesee, Knoxdale, Shoals, and Stonelick soils have ochric epipedons. The moderately well drained Eel and Flatrock soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils are on lower positions on the flood plains. Fox soils have an argillic horizon and are on higher lying terraces. Genesee and Knoxdale soils are on similar positions. Landes and Stonelick soils are coarse-loamy and are on natural levees or on gentle slopes. The moderately well drained Medway soils commonly are on lower positions. The very poorly drained Sloan soils are in depressions and backswamps."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent high water table is greater than 183 cm (6 feet). The moderately wet phase has an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth ranging from 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6 feet) between December and January in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid in the underlying material. These soils are subject to flooding from November to June."
