Eel, Flatrock, Fox, Genesee, Knoxdale, Shoals, and Stonelick soils have ochric epipedons. The moderately well drained Eel and Flatrock soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils are on lower positions on the flood plains. Fox soils have an argillic horizon and are on higher lying terraces. Genesee and Knoxdale soils are on similar positions. Landes and Stonelick soils are coarse-loamy and are on natural levees or on gentle slopes. The moderately well drained Medway soils commonly are on lower positions. The very poorly drained Sloan soils are in depressions and backswamps."

The moderately wet phase has an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth ranging from 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6 feet) between December and January in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid in the underlying material. These soils are subject to flooding from November to June."
