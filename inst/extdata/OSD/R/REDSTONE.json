  "STATES": "NH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redstone series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in loamy and sandy glacial till underlain by fragmental material.  They are on hills and mountain sides.  These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the solum and rapid permeability in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Rock fragments and very coarse sand range from 60 to 90 percent in the underlying fragmental material.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid throughout the soil.\nThe 0e horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Some pedons have an Oi horizon and some have an Oa horizon.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.\nThe Bh or Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The B horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is similar to the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is gravel.  The sand size is dominantly very coarse and coarse uncoated particles."
