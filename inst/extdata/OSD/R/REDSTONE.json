  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and the depth to fragmental material ranges from 11 to 25 inches; rock fragments range from 0 to 50 percent in the solum.  Rock fragments and very coarse sand range from 60 to 90 percent in the underlying fragmental material.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid throughout the soil.\nThe 0e horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Some pedons have an Oi horizon and some have an Oa horizon.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.\nThe Bh or Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The B horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is similar to the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is gravel.  The sand size is dominantly very coarse and coarse uncoated particles."
