  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosebud series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to weakly cemented fine grain sandstone.  These soils formed in loess and loamy, calcareous residuum weathered from weakly cemented fine grain sandstone on tableland plains and upland hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.) at the type location.",
