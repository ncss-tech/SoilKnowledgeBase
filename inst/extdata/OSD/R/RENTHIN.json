  "OVERVIEW": "The Renthin series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from clayey and silty shale of Permian age. These very gently sloping to gently sloping soils are on convex ridges and side slopes of prairie uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A). Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in).",
