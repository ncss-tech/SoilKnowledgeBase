  "OVERVIEW": "The Rotinom series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Rotinom soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
