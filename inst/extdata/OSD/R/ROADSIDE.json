  "OVERVIEW": "The Roadside series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Roadside soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite or andesitic tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,700 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
