  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rohnerville soils occur on uplifted marine and river terraces with slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The soils are formed on alluvium from sedimentary rocks, dominantly sandstone and mudstone. Elevations are 30 to 305 meters.   The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers influenced by a cooling marine layer, and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is from 900 to 1270 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is 13 to 14 degrees C. Frost-free season is 280 to 300 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 58 centimeters. (Ap, ABt)\n2. Argillic horizon: the zone from 20 to 140 centimeters. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The soils were formerly classified in the Brunizem group and were well to moderately well drained.\nNASIS User Pedon ID. 13CA600400\nNSSL Pedon ID. UCD6212014\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 6/66.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time.  ET\nThe type location was changed in 2014 to update the profile, limit the landscape position, and to provide a pedon for Characterization by KSSC.\nSoil was sampled in 1962 by University of California At Davis.  Data was entered into the NSSC database (62-CA-12-014).  Lab data shows evidence of weak argillic horizon and control section in fine family.\nSoil textures and coarse fragment content were modified from previous OSD based on current observations and NASIS data. Permissible landforms and drainage classes have been reduced to better define characteristics of the Rohnerville series.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
