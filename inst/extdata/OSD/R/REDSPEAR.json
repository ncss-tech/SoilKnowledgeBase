  "OVERVIEW": "The Redspear series consists of well drained soils that are\nshallow to hard, red siltstone or hard limestone on dipslopes.  They formed in residuum and slopewash alluvium derived dominantly from red siltstone.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to continuous carbonate accumulation ranges from 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section is loam or silt loam with 10 to 18 percent noncarbonate clay, 2 to 9 percent carbonate clay, and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser, excluding rock fragments.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent and are mainly angular siltstone or limestone pebbles.  Hue is 2.5YR or 5YR.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  These soils are moist in the moisture control section in March, April, May, and early June.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 14 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  EC is less than 4 mmhos.\nThe R is hard, calcareous, red siltstone or limestone which is commonly several feet thick and underlain by soft, red, sedimentary beds."
