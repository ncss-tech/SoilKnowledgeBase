  "OVERVIEW": "The Resota series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that occur on broad, moderately high ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. They formed in thick beds of sandy marine deposits.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 152 cm.",
