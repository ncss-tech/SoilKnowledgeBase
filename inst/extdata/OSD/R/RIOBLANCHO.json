  "OVERVIEW": "The Rioblancho series consists of moderately deep to duripan, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Rioblancho soils are on basin rims.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",
