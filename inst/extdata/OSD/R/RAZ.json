  "OVERVIEW": "The Raz series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff. Raz soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from basalt and tuff. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,250 to 2,075 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
