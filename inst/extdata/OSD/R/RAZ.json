  "OVERVIEW": "The Raz series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff. Raz soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
