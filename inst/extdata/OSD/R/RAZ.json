  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Raz soils are on lava plateaus. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from basalt and tuff. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,250 to 2,075 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
