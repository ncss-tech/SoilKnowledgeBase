  "OVERVIEW": "The Redraven series consists of very deep, well drained soils in glacial troughs, moraines, and on glaciated mountainsides and ridgetops. They formed in glacial till derived from gneiss, schist, or quartzite rocks with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",
