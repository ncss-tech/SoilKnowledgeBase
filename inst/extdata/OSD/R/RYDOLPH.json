  "OVERVIEW": "The Rydolph series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium of Holocene age.  These nearly level soils are on flood plains of major streams in the Coast Prairie.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
