  "OVERVIEW": "The Roby series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified materials on outwash plains, stream terraces, and on toe slopes in the uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 inches).",

Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches in thickness that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A or Ap horizon commonly is fine sandy loam or loam, but some pedons are loamy fine sand or sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. It averages between 12 and 18 percent clay and between 45 and 80 percent sand. Thin layers, less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick, of clay loam or sandy clay loam are in some pedons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a BC or BCg horizon.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It commonly contains iron-manganese oxide concretions or nodules. Texture is stratified sand to loam, and some pedons contain a component of gravel or thin strata of gravel. Gravel content averages less than 10 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline, and some pedons contain carbonates."

Hoopeston soils are on similar landscapes but have a mollic epipedon and do not have an argillic horizon. Martinsville soils are on similar landscapes and are well drained and have a higher percentage of clay in the particle-size control section. Ruark soils are poorly drained, are nearly level, and are on lower topography. Selma soils are in broad depressions, are poorly drained, have mollic epipedons, and have a higher percentage of clay in the particle-size control section."
