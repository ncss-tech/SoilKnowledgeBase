    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development commonly is 76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 inches), but ranges to 152 cm (60 inches). The particle-size control section ranges from 12 to 18 percent clay and 45 to 80 percent sand.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches in thickness that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A or Ap horizon commonly is fine sandy loam or loam, but some pedons are loamy fine sand or sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. It averages between 12 and 18 percent clay and between 45 and 80 percent sand. Thin layers, less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick, of clay loam or sandy clay loam are in some pedons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a BC or BCg horizon.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It commonly contains iron-manganese oxide concretions or nodules. Texture is stratified sand to loam, and some pedons contain a component of gravel or thin strata of gravel. Gravel content averages less than 10 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline, and some pedons contain carbonates."

Bronson soils contain more than 10 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Harbor soils average less than 52 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Ridgeville soils have a mollic epipedon. Whitaker soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 1020 mm (32 to 48 inches), mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 14 degrees C (48 to 57 degrees F), and elevation ranges from 104 to 305 meters (340 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

Ridgeville soils are on similar landscapes. Alvin soils are well drained and are on slightly higher topography. Darroch soils are on nearly level lake plains and have a mollic epipedon and a higher percentage of clay in the particle-size control section. Hoopeston soils are on similar landscapes but have a mollic epipedon and do not have an argillic horizon. Martinsville soils are on similar landscapes and are well drained and have a higher percentage of clay in the particle-size control section. Ruark soils are poorly drained, are nearly level, and are on lower topography. Selma soils are in broad depressions, are poorly drained, have mollic epipedons, and have a higher percentage of clay in the particle-size control section."
