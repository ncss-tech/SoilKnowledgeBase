  "OVERVIEW": "The Raindance series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Raindance soils are on stream terraces and outwash terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
