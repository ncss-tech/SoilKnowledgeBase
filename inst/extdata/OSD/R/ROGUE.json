Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  The solum ranges from 24 to 45 inches thick.  Rock fragments of the control section average 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 25 percent gravel, and 0 to 3 percent stones, not exceeding 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 4 moist and dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite or diorite.  The climate is characterized by warm to hot, dry summers and cold, moist to wet winters.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, mean January temperature is 32 degrees F, and mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 35 to 70 inches but may range to 120 inches in high winter rainfall interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
