  "OVERVIEW": "The Rogue series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitic rocks.  Rogue soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of mountain.   Slopes are 12 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
