  "OVERVIEW": "The Riswold series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loess over material weathered from basalt.  Riswold soils are on hills on plateaus and escarpments, and sideslopes and structural benches in canyons and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  They have moderately slow permeability.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
