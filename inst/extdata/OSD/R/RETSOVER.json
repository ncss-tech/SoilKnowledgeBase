  "OVERVIEW": "The Retsover series consists of deep, well drained soils on mesas and plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rocks.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 degrees F.",
