    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 37 degrees F to 46 degrees F.  Fine earth in the control section averages less than 15 percent and is too little to fill most interstices.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  It is dominantly sapric material.  It contains 20 to 40 percent volcanic ash and pumice.  It is extremely acid to moderately acid.  It has 10 to 30 percent cobbles and stones and 20 to 50 percent pebbles.\nThe C horizon has a texture in the fine earth fraction of sand or coarse sand.  The fine earth is generally confined to the upper 20 inches of the C horizon and does not exceed 15 percent of the total volume.  Most interstices are not filled with fines.  It contains volcanic ash and pumice in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The lower limit of the elevation range being on northerly and easterly exposures and in cold air drainages.  Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in an admixture of organic matter, volcanic ash and pumice over deep rock rubble from many types of rock.  The mean January air temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July air temperature is about 59 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 130 inches, with a considerable portion of this in the form of snow.  Frost-free season is 60 to 110 days."
