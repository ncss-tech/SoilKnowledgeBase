  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redmount series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial outwash with an influence of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Redmount soils are on broad outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer and early fall in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches. Depth to the very gravelly substratum ranges from 26 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam, with 10 to 18 percent clay and greater than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Rock fragments average less than 35 percent. The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. The texture is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel. Organic matter is 3 to 5 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. The texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The texture is sandy loam or loamy sand with 5 to 10 percent clay. It has 35 to 70 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. In some pedons, there are lime coatings on the underside of rock fragments."

Kabear soils lack very gravelly 2C horizons in the lower part of the control section. Lobert soils have weakly cemented durinodes and lack very gravelly 2C horizons. Ola soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Pucree soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Shively and Taterpa soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact and lack very gravelly 2C horizons. Suryon soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 39 to 43 degrees F. and lack skeletal 2C horizons within 26 to 40 inches."
