  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer and early fall in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches. Depth to the very gravelly substratum ranges from 26 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam, with 10 to 18 percent clay and greater than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Rock fragments average less than 35 percent. The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. The texture is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel. Organic matter is 3 to 5 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. The texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The texture is sandy loam or loamy sand with 5 to 10 percent clay. It has 35 to 70 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. In some pedons, there are lime coatings on the underside of rock fragments."

Iver and Wagore soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments throughout the particle-size control section and lack very gravelly 2C horizons. Kabear soils lack very gravelly 2C horizons in the lower part of the control section. Lobert soils have weakly cemented durinodes and lack very gravelly 2C horizons. Ola soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Pucree soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Shively and Taterpa soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact and lack very gravelly 2C horizons. Suryon soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 39 to 43 degrees F. and lack skeletal 2C horizons within 26 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redmount soils are on broad outwash plains. They formed in glaciofluvial outwash with an influence of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. Elevation is 3,400 to 4,400 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches, with most of the precipitation coming in the winter and spring months. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Josset soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are calcareous. Lostine soils are coarse-silty to a depth of 40 inches or more. Minam soils are fine-loamy and are on alluvial fans."
