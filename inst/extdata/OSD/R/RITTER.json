  "OVERVIEW": "The Ritter series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from basalt.  Ritter soils are on mountain sideslopes and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to basalt bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The profile is stratified and may or may not contain stone lines.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Ritter soils are usually moist but dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days at depths of 8 to 24 inches in most years.  Mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has 5 to 15 percent clay and less than 30 percent coarse and very coarse sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw and C horizons typically have mollic colors but have less than 1 percent organic matter.  The Bw is weak coarse and medium subangular blocky to moderate coarse subangular blocky structure.  The C horizon has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent gravel.  Reaction for the Bw and C horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Texture is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam."
