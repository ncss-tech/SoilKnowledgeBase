  "OVERVIEW": "The Ripon series consists of well-drained soils which are moderately deep to a lithic contact with limestone.  They formed in a mantle of loess and in the underlying till which is underlain in turn by limestone on ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Mendota soils are on areas next to Ripon soils where depth to limestone is greater than 152 cm (60 inches) and the solum formed in highly calcareous glacial till.  In areas where the loess is thicker than 152 cm (60 inches) or no part of the sola formed in till, the Tama soils are nearby on similar slopes."
