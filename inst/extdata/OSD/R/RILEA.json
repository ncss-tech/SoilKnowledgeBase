The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction is strongly or very strongly acid throughout.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 20 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has  value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly loam, or very gravelly loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 40 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles."

Mosinee soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Saddlepeak soils have a solum dominated by channer and flagstone rock fragments and are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Threetrees soils have a solum dominated by channer and flagstone rock fragments of schist or phyllite origin.  Vly soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bw horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rilea soils are on metastable broad ridgetops and active side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 160 inches.   The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 60 to 120 days."
