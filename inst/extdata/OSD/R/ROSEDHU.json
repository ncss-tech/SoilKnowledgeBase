It is extremely acid to strongly acid in about the upper 25 inches and very strongly acid to slightly acid below about 25 inches.  The Bh horizon is within 20 inches of the surface.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  When dry, the A1 horizon has a salt-and-pepper appearance.  The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1.\nThe Bh horizon, or where present, the B'h horizon, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Tongues or pockets of grayish sand are in some pedons.\nThe A'2 horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral; value of 3 to 7; and chroma of 0 to 3.

Baratari, Echaw, Leon, Mascotte, Olustee, Seagate, and Seewee soils do not have an umbric epipedon.  Lynn Haven soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Ridgeland soils have a spodic horizon within 10 inches of the soil surface."
