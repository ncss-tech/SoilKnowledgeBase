  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosedhu series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  These soils are on low, nearly level areas on terraces of the Lower Coastal Plain.  The water table is near or above the soil surface for as much as 7 months annually.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  (Note: taxonomic placement ONLY was updated)",
