  "REVDATE": "12/1999",
  "STATES": "SC",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosedhu series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  These soils are on low, nearly level areas on terraces of the Lower Coastal Plain.  The water table is near or above the soil surface for as much as 7 months annually.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  (Note: taxonomic placement ONLY was updated)",

The Bh horizon is within 20 inches of the surface.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  When dry, the A1 horizon has a salt-and-pepper appearance.  The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1.\nThe Bh horizon, or where present, the B'h horizon, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Tongues or pockets of grayish sand are in some pedons.\nThe A'2 horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral; value of 3 to 7; and chroma of 0 to 3.
