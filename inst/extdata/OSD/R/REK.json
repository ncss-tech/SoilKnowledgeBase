(Bt horizons)\nParalithic contact at 63 inches.\nBase saturation less than 35 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon or immediately above a paralithic contact.\nThe soil originally had a gravelly surface that has been mechanically removed for resource material. This has caused a change in the soil hydrology.  Redoximorphic features are relic and are not related to present wetness condition.\nThe soil does not have hue that becomes redder with depth.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A complete characterization report was provided by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Soil Characterization Laboratory from a 1988 pit study in Fayette County.  Limited characterization data in a report to LCRA, \"Comparison of Physical and Chemical Properties and Production Capacity of Overburden and Land-Surface Soils from Proposed Mine Site, Fayette County, Texas\", Texas Tech University.
