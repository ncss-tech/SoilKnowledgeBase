Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic ranges from 50 to 70 percent.  Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon or immediately above a paralithic contact ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The texture is variable consisting of extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam.  Gravel and cobble content ranges from 65 to 80 percent.  About 5 to 10 percent of the volume of the coarse fraction is composed of cobbles, mainly less than 5 inches across their long axis.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.  The boundary is abrupt.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  There are few to many redoximorphic features in shades of red, gray, brown or yellow.  Texture is gravelly sandy clay or gravelly clay.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 6. There are few to many redoximorphic features in shades of red, gray, brown or yellow.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.

There are redoximorphic features in shades of red, gray, brown or yellow.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay.  Coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Cr or 2C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red occur in most pedons.  It is shale or weakly cemented sandstone that has texture of fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay.  Siliceous pebbles range from 1 to 3 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid."

Aubrey and Hearne soils have sola 20 to 40 inches thick.  Marquez soils do not have zones of iron depletions in the upper Bt horizons.  Stein soils do not have a paralithic contact within 80 inches of the soil surface.  Cuthbert and Kirvin soils are well drained and are in the udic moisture regime.  Straber and Tremona soils have sandy surface textures and have base saturation greater than 35 percent."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used as rangeland and wildlife habitat.   Because of the removal of the surface layer and the highly acidic and droughthy subsoil, these areas are slow to revegetate.  Most areas are dominated by annual threeawns.  Other species include broomsedge bluestem, brownseed paspalum, prickly pear cactus, false indigo, broomweed and juniper."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 3 inches.  (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 3 to 63 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nParalithic contact at 63 inches.\nBase saturation less than 35 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon or immediately above a paralithic contact.\nThe soil originally had a gravelly surface that has been mechanically removed for resource material. This has caused a change in the soil hydrology.  Redoximorphic features are relic and are not related to present wetness condition.\nThe soil does not have hue that becomes redder with depth.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A complete characterization report was provided by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Soil Characterization Laboratory from a 1988 pit study in Fayette County.  Limited characterization data in a report to LCRA, \"Comparison of Physical and Chemical Properties and Production Capacity of Overburden and Land-Surface Soils from Proposed Mine Site, Fayette County, Texas\", Texas Tech University.
