  "OVERVIEW": "The Roaringlion series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash over fine tertiary sediments.  These soils are on outwash fans, fan remnants and eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
