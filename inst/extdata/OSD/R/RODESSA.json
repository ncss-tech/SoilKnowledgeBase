    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to over 100 inches.\nThe A11 horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  The A12 horizon is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  The A horizons are loam or fine sandy loam and very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe B1 horizon is light yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  It is loam or fine sandy loam and very strongly acid through medium acid.\nThe A'2&B horizon is white (10YR 8/2), light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  It is loam or fine sandy loam and is very strongly acid through medium acid.  The A'2 material comprises 60 to 75 percent of the horizon.  The Btg&A' horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), dark gray (10YR 4/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).\nThe Bt part of this horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8), or pale brown (10YR 6/3) in some pedons.  Mottles are red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8), dark red (2.5YR 3/6), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8), reddish brown (5YR 4/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8), or brown (7.5YR 5/4).  The Bt part of this horizon is clay or clay loam that comprises 70 to 90 percent of the matrix.  This horizon is very strongly acid through medium acid.\nThe B22t and B23t horizons are dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4), dark red (2.5YR 3/6), red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8), yellowih red (5YR 4/6, 4/8), dark brown (7.5YR 4/4), or reddish brown (5YR 4/4).  Mottles with chromas of 2 or less occur throughout and yellowish brown mottles ranges from none to common.  These horizons are clay or clay loam and are very strongly acid through slightly acid.  Few to many slickensides are present in the lower part, normally below 40 inches."

Addielou, Duralde, Frizzell, Glenmora, and Raino soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section; in addition, Frizzell, Glenmora, and Raino soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Atasco soils lack hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Boswell, Bryarly, Gore, Iredell, Kipling, Susquehanna, and Woodtell soils crack when dry and have no tonguing of an albic horizon into the Bt horizon.  Counts soils have browner Bt horizons and do not have an albic horizon that tongues into the Bt horizon.  Messer soils have less than 18 percent clay in the B horizon and have no gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the B horizon.  Porum and Whakana soils have albic materials in some subsurface horizon of the Bt horizon; in addition, Whakana soils lack gray mottles in the upper Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rodessa soils are on nearly level uplands and terraces.  They normally occupy circular mounds 30 to 200 feet in diameter and 20 to 40 inches higher than the intermound landscape.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent and are mainly convex.  The soils formed in clay alluvium.  The climate is warm humid.  The average annual precipitation near the type location is about 43 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 64 degrees F. and the annual Thornthwaite P-E index is about 72."
