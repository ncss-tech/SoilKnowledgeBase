Addielou, Duralde, Frizzell, Glenmora, and Raino soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section; in addition, Frizzell, Glenmora, and Raino soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Atasco soils lack hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Boswell, Bryarly, Gore, Iredell, Kipling, Susquehanna, and Woodtell soils crack when dry and have no tonguing of an albic horizon into the Bt horizon.  Counts soils have browner Bt horizons and do not have an albic horizon that tongues into the Bt horizon.  Messer soils have less than 18 percent clay in the B horizon and have no gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the B horizon.  Porum and Whakana soils have albic materials in some subsurface horizon of the Bt horizon; in addition, Whakana soils lack gray mottles in the upper Bt horizon."

They normally occupy circular mounds 30 to 200 feet in diameter and 20 to 40 inches higher than the intermound landscape.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent and are mainly convex.  The soils formed in clay alluvium.  The climate is warm humid.  The average annual precipitation near the type location is about 43 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 64 degrees F. and the annual Thornthwaite P-E index is about 72."
