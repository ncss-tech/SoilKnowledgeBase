  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockbound series consists of shallow and very shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in glacial drift, slope alluvium and colluvium derived predominantly from granodiorite.  Due to glaciation some areas have a mix of rock types.  The Rockbound soils are on glacial-valley floors and walls in the mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1499 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
