  "OVERVIEW": "The Richfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loess. Richfield soils are on tableland plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 46 centimeters (18 inches) and mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
