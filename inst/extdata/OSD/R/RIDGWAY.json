  "OVERVIEW": "The Ridgway series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess or silty sediment and the underlying loamy and sandy outwash or stratified alluvium on stream terraces and flood plains. These soils have moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) in the upper part and high Ksat in the lower part. Slope gradients are 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
