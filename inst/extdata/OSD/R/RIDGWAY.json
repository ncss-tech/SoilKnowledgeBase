  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ridgway soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and high flood plains. Slope gradients are between 0 and 18 percent. These soils formed in 60 to 100 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess or silty sediment and in loamy or sandy outwash or stratified alluvium. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 15 degrees C (54 to 59 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1015 to 1220 mm (40 to 48 inches). Frost-free period is 175 to 205 days. Elevation is 100 to 225 meters (325 to 735 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Crawleyville and Skelton soils have a mantle of loess less than 60 cm thick and are in positions below the Ridgway soils. Hickory soils formed in less than 50 cm of loess and the underlying till and are on steep valley slopes above Ridgway soils. Alvin and Skelton soils are on similar landforms as Ridgway soils. Sexton soils are poorly drained and Geff soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in the hydrosequence with Ridgway soils."

The potential for surface water runoff is low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part and high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the lower part of the series control section. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part of the series control section. Ridgway soils on high floodplains or low stream terraces are subject to rare flooding for very brief or brief periods between November and June in normal years."
