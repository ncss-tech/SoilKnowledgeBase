  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Bassfield and Latonia series are in the same family and the Rumford series is in a closely related family. Bassfield and Latonia soils are on lower terrace positions, are subject to flooding and are semiactive. Rumford soils are generally parallel to the Atlantic coast. In addition, Rumford soils receive much less precipitation than Rutan soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rutan soils are on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain parallel to the Gulf Coast. They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The climate is humid subtropical. The average annual precipitation ranges from 58 to 62 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 70 degrees."

Benndale soils are on lower positions and do not have clay decrease within 58 inches. The moderately well drained Chatom soils are on lower positions and are fine-loamy. Fruitdale soils are on similar to lower positions and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. The moderately well and well drained Malbis and Poarch soils are on lower positions, have fine-loamy control sections and have more than 5 percent plinthite. Rattlesnake Forks are on similar to higher positions and have sandy control sections. Toinette soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick."
