  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ricks series consists of somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite. These soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping high lake terraces, alluvial fans, and deltas. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 20 inches thick. Depth to the very gravelly or very cobbly sand (IIC horizon) ranges from 15 to 30 inches. The lower part of the B horizon is usually moderately calcareous, but carbonates are mainly concentrated in the C horizon at depths of 15 to 25 inches. The rock fragments are dominantly rounded gravel size quartzite, sandstone or limestone rocks, ranging from about 20 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons and 60 to 80 percent in the C horizons. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 62 to 68 F. The soils are moist for 55 to 65 percent of the time and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more in all parts of the 8 to 24 inch section in the summer and autumn.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak to moderate medium or fine granular or weak subangular blocky structure. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam and has less than 18 percent clay. This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky structure. It has few thin to common thin clay films mainly in pores and bridging between sand grains. It does not meet the clay increase requirement of an argillic horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from very gravely or very cobbly sand to very gravelly loamy sand."

Cheney and Downey soils have silt loam B2 horizons with less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Lakewin soils have more than 50 percent fine and coarser sand in the upper part of the control section. Steed soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and have too few fines to fill the voids larger than 1 mm. Sterling soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the control section. Stratford soils lack calcic horizons."
