  "OVERVIEW": "The Rickmore series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy calcareous material of eolian origin. These soils are on nearly level and gently sloping uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
