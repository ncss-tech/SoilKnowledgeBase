  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  The Bt/E and B't horizons are definitive for the series.  Calcium-magnesium ratios are variable in the Bt horizons, but typically are less than 1 in the B't horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  The  A horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Ap horizon in severely eroded areas has colors and textures similar to the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe E horizon and E part of the Bt/E horizon have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or sandy loam and occurs in streaks and pockets that make up as much as 50 percent of the horizon.  Small dark colored bodies that are compact and brittle make up as much as 10 percent by volume of the Bt/E horizon in some pedons.\nA thin BA or BE horizon is in some pedons. The Bt, Bt part of the Bt/E, and B't horizons have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  They are sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.  The B't horizon, in most pedons is mottled with shades of gray, brown, red, or yellow. Clay content of the Bt horizon averages between 18 and 30 percent in the upper 20 inches and the silt content ranges from 20 to 50 percent. The Bt and B't horizons are very strongly acid to medium acid.  As much as 15 percent by volume of ironstone fragments or quartz gravel are present within the solum of some pedons.  The clay content decreases from the upper Bt horizons to the Bt/E horizon and increases again in the B't horizons."

Allen, Etowah, Sailes, and Silsbee soils soils do not have a bisequal profile.  Holston soils have color hues of 7.5YR and 10YR throughout.  Addielou soils have an A horizon greater than 20 inches thick.  Bama, Ironcity, Minvale, and Noboco soils have a CEC to clay ratio less than.24 in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Bama, Octavia, and Pikeville soils do not have a bisequal profile; Avilla, Ironcity, and Nella  soils contain more than 10 percent coarse fragments throughout; Minvale soils contain less than 20 percent fine and coarser sand in the control section; and Dubach, Leesburg, Noboco, and Warnock soils have color hues of 7.5YR and 10YR throughout.  Lytle soils have a surface mantle of loess that is 2 to 3 feet thick."
