  "OVERVIEW": "The Rackerby series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from intrusive igneous rocks, mainly diorite and gabbro and metamorphosed intrusive igneous rocks, mainly quartz diorite.  Rackerby soils are on side slopes on plutons in Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 15 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, (889 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
