  "OVERVIEW": "The Rollaway series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in stratified alluvium over clayey lacustrine deposits on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",

Potential surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very slow in the lower part. The soil is subject to frequent, brief to very long periods of flooding from March to May."
