    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rollaway soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in stratified sandy to silty alluvium over clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 to 762 mm (27 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 70 to 130 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

The depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 61 cm (2 feet) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at any time during normal years. Potential surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very slow in the lower part. The soil is subject to frequent, brief to very long periods of flooding from March to May."
