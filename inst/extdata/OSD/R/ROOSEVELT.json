These soils are usually dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for more than half the time when soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.  The particle-size control section is 7 to 15 percent clay and 10 to 30 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.   It is 15 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Structure is weak or moderate granular or weak fine or very fine subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky."

Burch, Calpine, Cashmere, Cashmont, Rio King, Snake Hollow, and Surprise soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Roloff soils are silt loam or very fine fine sandy loam throughout the particle-size control section.  Caphealy soils have a significant influence of sand-size ash (10 to 30 percent glass) throughout the profile.  Shantown soils are very deep."

Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 800 to 2,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."
