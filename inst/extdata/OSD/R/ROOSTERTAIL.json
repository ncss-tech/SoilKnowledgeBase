These soils formed in eolian deposits from granitoid and/or metamorphic rocks over alluvium from granitoid and/or metamorphic rocks. Elevations range from 150 to 385 meters (492 to 1,263 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, dry winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 26 degrees C (73.5 to 79 degrees F). The frost-free season is 360 to 365 days."
