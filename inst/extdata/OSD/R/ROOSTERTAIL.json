  "OVERVIEW": "The Roostertail series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in  eolian deposits from granitoid and/or metamorphic rocks over alluvium from granitoid and/or metamorphic rocks. Roostertail soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 millimeters (3 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 25 degrees C (77 degrees F).",
