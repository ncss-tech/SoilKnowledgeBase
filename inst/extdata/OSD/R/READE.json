  "OVERVIEW": "The Reade series consists of moderately well drained soils, moderately deep to dolomitic sandstone.  They formed in loamy till on ground moraines underlain by limestone, dolomite, or dolomitic sandstone.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and slow to moderately slow in the bedrock.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
