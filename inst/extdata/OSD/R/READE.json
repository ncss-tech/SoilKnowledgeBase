The solum ranges from extremely acid to slightly alkaline.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent and the volume of coarse fragments larger than 3 inches range from 0 to 10 percent.  About 50 percent of the coarse fragments are flat or angular.\nThe O horizon has hue 5YR or 7.5YR, or is neutral.\nSome pedons have an A horizon.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon, not in all pedons, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs2 horizon is discontinuous and does not occur in some pedons.

Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is fine sandy loam.  The E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3.  It is loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have an E/B horizon overlying the B/E horizon.\nThe BC horizon, not in all pedons, has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  It is fine sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Cr horizon overlying the limestone, dolomitic sandstone, or dolomite bedrock."

Shoepac, Nahma, and Sundell soils occur in complexes with Reade.  Shoepac soils are moderately well drained with depths greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Nahma soils are poorly drained and Sundell soils are somewhat poorly drained.  The somewhat poorly drained Charlevoix and the poorly drained Ensley soils have bedrock at depths greater than 60 inches and are common associates in depressions and drainageways."
