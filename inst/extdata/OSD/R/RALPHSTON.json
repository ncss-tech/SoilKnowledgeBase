  "OVERVIEW": "The Ralphston series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and other volcanic materials on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches; and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
