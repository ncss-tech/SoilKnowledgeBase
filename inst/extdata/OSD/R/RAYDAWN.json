  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Raydawn series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments and alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. Raydawn soils are on backslopes of escarpments and interfluves of undulating plains with slopes ranging from 5 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",
