They formed in eolian materials and alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from shale or sandstone. Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,100 feet."
