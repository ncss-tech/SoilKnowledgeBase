  "OVERVIEW": "The Rumley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy and calcareous alluvial sediments.  These nearly level and gently sloping soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is greater than 60 inches.  The fine earth fraction is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay with silicate clay content ranging from 25 to 35 percent.  Particles coarser than very fine sand range from 15 to 40 percent and are mainly concretions of calcium carbonate.  Some Bk horizons contain enough strongly cemented concretions to be gravelly.  The weighted average calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Depth to a distinct and contrasting calcic horizon ranges from 28 to 42 inches.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Thickness is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe Bk1 and Bk2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Pitted concretions of calcium carbonate, 1 to 5 mm across, range from few to common and makes up less than 10 percent by volume.  Soft masses and/or threads of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  Some pedons contain a Bw horizon that is calcareous.\nThe Bk3 and Bk4 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Concretions, 1 to 10 mm across, soft masses, films and threads of calcium carbonate range from common to many and make up 10 to 35 percent by volume.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction ranges from 40 to 50 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bolar, Carbengle, Sunev, and Topsey series in the same family and the similar Lewisville, Nuvalde, Oakalla and Venus series.  The Bolar soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Carbengle soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Sunev soils contain more finely divided lime and less concretions of calcium carbonates in the upper Bk and have a less distinct calcic horizon.  Topsey soils have sola less than 40 inches over shaly and marly sediments.  Lewisville, Nuvalde, and Venus soils have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Oakalla soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick."

Nuff soils are on slightly higher upland positions and have a solum less than 40 inches thick. Seawillow soils are on similar positions but have ochric epipedons."
