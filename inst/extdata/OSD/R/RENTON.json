The upper part of the control section contains less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  The lower part of the control section consists of sand or loamy sand.  The control section contains less than 15 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Ap horizon ranges from very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has moderate medium and coarse granular structure.\nThe C horizon is dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2, 10YR 4/2) depletions, with dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations.  It is fine sandy loam to silty clay loam, with thin lenses of sand or loamy sand.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon is black (10YR 2/1) to dark gray (10YR 4/1) with strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) concentrations, mostly in thin lenses of finer textures.  It is sand or loamy sand; some pedons contain thin lenses of fine sandy loam or silt loam.  The horizon is massive or single grained."

Renton soils occur in a humid climate with an average January temperature of 38 degrees F.; an average July temperature of 64 degrees F.; and a mean annual temperature of about 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 200 days.  The annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches, most of which falls as rain during the winter months. Each of the summer months has at least 1 inch of rainfall.  Snow is infrequent."
