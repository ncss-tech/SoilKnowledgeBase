  "OVERVIEW": "The Rowel series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from volcanic rocks.  These soils are on hills, mountains and plateau side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm annual and mean temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
