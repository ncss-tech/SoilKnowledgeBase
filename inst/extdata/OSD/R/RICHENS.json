    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 17 to 25 inches thick.  The upper boundary of the Bt horizon ranges from 19 to 24 inches.  The combined thickness of the A, E, and Bt horizon ranges from 55 to 60 inches or more over bedrock.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 41 to 44 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 30 to 45 days during the late summer months.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, and 2 and 3 moist.  It has 0 to 40 percent pebbles and cobbles in the lower portion.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 and 6 dry, and 4 and 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, and 6 moist.  It is cobbly silt loam, cobbly silty clay loam or very cobbly clay loam with 30 to 70 percent cobbles and pebbles.  It is slightly acid or neutral and 2 to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 8 dry, and moist.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  It is medium acid to neutral."

Burnette, Cochetopa, Faim, Fulcher, Luna, Sudduth and Toponce soils have hues browner or yellower than 5YR in the argillic horizon.  In addition Burnette, Fulcher and Glengarry soils have visible carbonates within the series control section.  Cochetopa soils contain dark colored magnetic mineral grains in the fine sand and silt fractions.  Faim, Friona, Fulcher, Grouse, Luna, Mayflower, Mound, Paulson, Skutum, Slights, and Sudduth soils have solum less than 50 inches thick.  Glengarry, Luna and Mayflower soils have bedrock at depths less than 40 inches.  Perinos soils lack E horizons and neutral argillic horizons.  All these soils lack E horizons."

These soils formed in glacial till weathered from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite over residuum weathered from sandstone.  The climate is humid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 31 to 42 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 53 to 55 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 40 to 65 days."
