  "OVERVIEW": "The Richens series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial till.  Richens soils are on rolling mountain tops and have slopes of 3 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 30 to 45 days during the late summer months.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, and 2 and 3 moist.  It has 0 to 40 percent pebbles and cobbles in the lower portion.

In addition Burnette, Fulcher and Glengarry soils have visible carbonates within the series control section.  Cochetopa soils contain dark colored magnetic mineral grains in the fine sand and silt fractions.  Faim, Friona, Fulcher, Grouse, Luna, Mayflower, Mound, Paulson, Skutum, Slights, and Sudduth soils have solum less than 50 inches thick.  Glengarry, Luna and Mayflower soils have bedrock at depths less than 40 inches.  Perinos soils lack E horizons and neutral argillic horizons.  All these soils lack E horizons."
