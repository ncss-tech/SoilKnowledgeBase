  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. A lithologic discontinuity is present below 40 inches in most pedons. Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles of chert with some sandstone and shale and range from 10 to 40 percent in the A horizon and from 15 to 70 percent in the Bw and underlying horizons. The soil ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray.\nThe 2Bt horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam, loam, clay, or silty clay. Mottles are in shades of gray, brown, or yellow."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils include Ennis, Ocana, and Riverby series. Ennis soils have lower base saturation and fewer rock fragments. Ocana soils have mixed mineralogy and fewer rock fragments. Riverby soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have a cambic horizon."
