  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact, solum thickness, and depth to the base of the argillic horizon range from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments, dominantly siltstone with some shale, range from 0\nto 20 percent throughout. Shale pararock fragments are common throughout the solum in many pedons.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay.\nDepth to the base of the ochric epipedon ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silt loam and less commonly is silty clay loam where eroded.  It is slightly acid to extremely acid unless limed.  Some pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.  Some pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam.  It is strongly acid to\nextremely acid.\nThe Bt horizon has dominant hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 7.5YR with thin subhorizons of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Subhorizons in the lower part have variegations and redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less and redoximorphic features of higher chroma.  It is dominantly silty clay or clay with thin subhorizons of silty clay loam.  Subhorizons of channery silty clay are in the lower part in some pedons.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nSome pedons have a BC or C horizon.  The BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or their channery analogues.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nBedrock consists of soft clay shale with interbedded siltstone in some areas."

Latham soils typically have a browner subsoil and are on\nsimilar positions.  Brownsville, Rigley, Shelocta, Wellston, Wharton, and Zanesville soils do not have a paralithic contact within 40 inches. Coolville soils have a silt mantle and typically are on broader less sloping summits or on broad benches.  Brownsville, Wellston, and Wharton soils are\non similar positions.  Rigley soils are on backslopes, benches, footslopes, and fans.  Shelocta soils are on backslopes, footslopes, and benches. Zanesville soils are on summits and upper side slopes."
