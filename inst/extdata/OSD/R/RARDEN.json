  "OVERVIEW": "The Rarden series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum from acid clay shale with interbedded siltstone in some areas.  These soils are on hills.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and\nmean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

Rock fragments, dominantly siltstone with some shale, range from 0\nto 20 percent throughout. Shale pararock fragments are common throughout the solum in many pedons.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay.\nDepth to the base of the ochric epipedon ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silt loam and less commonly is silty clay loam where eroded.  It is slightly acid to extremely acid unless limed.  Some pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.  Some pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam.  It is strongly acid to\nextremely acid.\nThe Bt horizon has dominant hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 7.5YR with thin subhorizons of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Subhorizons in the lower part have variegations and redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less and redoximorphic features of higher chroma.  It is dominantly silty clay or clay with thin subhorizons of silty clay loam.  Subhorizons of channery silty clay are in the lower part in some pedons.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nSome pedons have a BC or C horizon.  The BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or their channery analogues.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nBedrock consists of soft clay shale with interbedded siltstone in some areas."
