  "OVERVIEW": "The Rushlake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy and gravelly deposits on lake beaches.  These soils have rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nSome pedons have Bw or BC horizons. with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8.  Fe concentrations and depletions range from none to many and faint to prominent.  It is sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, or loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.

Aylmer and Lino soils do not have rock fragments in the series control section.  Clearriver soils have lamellae totaling less than 3 inches in cumulative thickness in the series control section.  Hiwood, Poppleton, Redby, and Sciota soils have 5 percent or less rock fragments in the series control section.  Meehan soils have soil reaction of 7.3 or less in the series control section.  Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1500 feet above sea level."

Poorly drained Hangaard, Isan, Roscommon soils are in slightly lower landscape positions.  Very poorly drained Forada, Isan, and Leafriver soils are in depressions.
