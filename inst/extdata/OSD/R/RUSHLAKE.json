The rock fragments in the A horizon range from 0 to 15 percent gravel by volume and 5 to 35 percent in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nSome pedons have Bw or BC horizons. with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8.  Fe concentrations and depletions range from none to many and faint to prominent.  It is sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, or loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Fe concentrations and depletions range from none to many and faint to prominent.  The sand grains are mostly uncoated.

Aylmer and Lino soils do not have rock fragments in the series control section.  Clearriver soils have lamellae totaling less than 3 inches in cumulative thickness in the series control section.  Hiwood, Poppleton, Redby, and Sciota soils have 5 percent or less rock fragments in the series control section.  Meehan soils have soil reaction of 7.3 or less in the series control section.  Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rushlake soils are on lake beaches.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  They formed in very deep sandy and gravelly deposits that have water tables levels associated with the adjacent lakes.  Mean annual air temperature is estimated to range from 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1500 feet above sea level."

Excessively drained Corliss soils are on higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Duelm and Friendship soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.  Poorly drained Hangaard, Isan, Roscommon soils are in slightly lower landscape positions.  Very poorly drained Forada, Isan, and Leafriver soils are in depressions.
