  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 degrees to 53 degrees F. The soil is usually moist, but is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 70 consecutive days in late summer and early fall. The depth to calcareous material ranges from 18 to 30 inches. the solum is about 30 to 45 inches thick and is neutral or mildly alkaline. Rock fragments ranges up to 10 percent by volume, and consist mostly of fine pebbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or neutral dry and moist.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist. This horizon is mainly clay loam, but ranges to silty clay loam or heavy loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay. Thin lenses of coarser material are in some pedons.  The accumulation of calcium carbonate in the lower part is weak or moderate.\nThe Cca horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous, and is stratified with layers of coarser material in most pedons."

The climate has dry warm summers with cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation of 11 inches, mean annual summer temperature is 69 degrees to 73 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 52 degrees F.
