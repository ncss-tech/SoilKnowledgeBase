Abrazo soils have a lithic contact of igneous bedrock at 27 inches. Carnero soils have a lithic contact of sandstone at 28 inches. Cueva soils have a paralithic contact of sandstone and shale at 33 inches. Celsosprings, Charette, Concho, Judd, Remunda and Swastika soils are very deep. Cantina and Rond soils are deep. The Rond series was created to be the deeper counterpart to the Roundtop series."

These soils are formed in place in residuum from cherty limestone and limestone with some local influence from quartzite. Elevations range from 4500 to 6000 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 degrees F. to 58 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days."
