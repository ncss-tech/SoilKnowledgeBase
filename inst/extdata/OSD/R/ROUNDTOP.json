  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Roundtop soils consist of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone and limestone with some local influence from quartzite. Roundtop soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep plains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

Abrazo soils have a lithic contact of igneous bedrock at 27 inches. Carnero soils have a lithic contact of sandstone at 28 inches. Cueva soils have a paralithic contact of sandstone and shale at 33 inches. Celsosprings, Charette, Concho, Judd, Remunda and Swastika soils are very deep. Cantina and Rond soils are deep. The Rond series was created to be the deeper counterpart to the Roundtop series."
