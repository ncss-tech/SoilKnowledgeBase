Depth to the very gravelly clay horizon is 20 to 36 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10R, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5. It contains 35 to 60 percent clay and 10 to 30 percent rock fragments. CaC03 equivalent in zone of lime accumulation is estimated at 5 to 15 percent."
