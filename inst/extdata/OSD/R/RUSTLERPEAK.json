    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 40 to 60 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 40 percent gravel, and 15 to 40 percent cobbles and stones.  It is moderately acid to slightly acid.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry. It has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 40 percent gravel, and 15 to 40 percent cobbles and stones.  It is a very cobbly clay loam, very cobbly loam, very gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam."

Clarkscreek has 7 to 15 percent clay in the particle size control section, is moderately deep to a lithic contact and the rock fragments are rounded to subrounded in shape (till deposits) on glaciated mountain slopes.  Growden soils are deep and have an umbric epipedon over 20 inches thick. Puzzlecreek soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to hard basalt bedrock, have a mean annual soil temperature of 34 to 39 degrees F. and the particle size control section averages 5 to 15 percent clay. Rockcreekbutte has 3 to 10 percent clay in the particle size control section and is moderately deep to a lithic contact, also the parent material is granodiorite."

The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 100 days.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent."
