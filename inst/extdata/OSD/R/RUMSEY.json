    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1498.  Diagnostic  horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ash influenced ochric epipedon from 0 to 8 inches (Bs horizon); a cambic horizon from 8 to 16 inches (2Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (2Bw, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons).  Rumsey soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups.  This series would also meet Haplustandic subgroup criteria.  The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
