The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon typically contains carbonates and has slight to strong effervescence.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are free of carbonates in the C horizon."

The soils formed in calcareous, residuum weathered from soft sandstone.  A mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation of 10 to 16 inches, more than 70 percent of which falls in the spring and summer.  Frost-free period ranges from 110 to 130 days and elevation ranges from 1900 to 5200 feet."

Fleak soils are on steeper sideslopes and knobs.  They have a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 inches.  Marmarth soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon.  They are on similar but more stable positions.  Tusler soils are on similar positions.  They are sandy."
