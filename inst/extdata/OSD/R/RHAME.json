  "OVERVIEW": "The Rhame series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from soft sandstone.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 13 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon typically contains carbonates and has slight to strong effervescence.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are free of carbonates in the C horizon."
