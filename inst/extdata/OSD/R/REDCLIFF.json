  "OVERVIEW": "The Redcliff series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from volcanic or metavolcanic rock with minor amounts of ash and loess influence.  Redcliff soils are on hills.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section is 15 to 35 percent clay and averages more than 18 percent clay.  It has 35 to 70 percent gravel and cobbles.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The solum is neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part and neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is gravelly loam, cobbly sandy loam, very gravelly loam, or very cobbly sandy loam with 10 to 55 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  In some pedons, the A1 horizon may have a dry value ranging to 6 but when mixed with the A2 horizon, a dry value of 4 or 5 results.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 6 dry and moist.  The fine-earth texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or sandy loam.  It has 15 to 75 percent gravel and 0 to 40 percent cobbles.  It has 10 to 35 percent clay."
