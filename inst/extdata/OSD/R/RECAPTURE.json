  "OVERVIEW": "The Recapture series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in reworked eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Recapture soils are on mesas and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
