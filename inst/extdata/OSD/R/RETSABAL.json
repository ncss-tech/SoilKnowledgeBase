  "OVERVIEW": "The Retsabal series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from Carmel formation gypsum. Retsabal soils are on stable structural benches and knolls on structural benches with slopes of 2 to 50 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
