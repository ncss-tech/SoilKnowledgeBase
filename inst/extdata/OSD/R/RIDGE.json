  "OVERVIEW": "The Ridge series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated interbedded sandy and loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
