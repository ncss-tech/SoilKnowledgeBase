The official series description was edited according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation to recorrelate Rennie soils mapped in the flood plains of MLRAs 1 and 4a is recommended.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
