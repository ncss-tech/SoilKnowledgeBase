  "OVERVIEW": "The Rance series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in medium textured calcareous sediments over highly gypsiferous materials or soft gypsum bedrock on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans and valley fill.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The weighted average of the textural control section is usually a silt loam with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry or moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak subangular blocky to massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry or moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist."

Malargo, Reeves, and Reflection soils are in a fine-loamy family with thermic temperature and Aridic moisture regimes.  Holloman and Tanbark soils have paralithic or lithic contact at less than 20 inches; also, Holloman has a thermic temperature regime.   Tulargo soils are in a fine-loamy family with an aridic moisture regime."
