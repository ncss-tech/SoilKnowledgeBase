The weighted average of the textural control section is usually a silt loam with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry or moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak subangular blocky to massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry or moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist."

Malargo, Reeves, and Reflection soils are in a fine-loamy family with thermic temperature and Aridic moisture regimes.  Holloman and Tanbark soils have paralithic or lithic contact at less than 20 inches; also, Holloman has a thermic temperature regime.   Tulargo soils are in a fine-loamy family with an aridic moisture regime."
