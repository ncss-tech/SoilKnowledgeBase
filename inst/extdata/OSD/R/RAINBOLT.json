The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F.   Ten to 20 percent of the surface is covered with granitic pebbles.  Depth to the base of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 16 to 27 inches.  This soil contains few to common mica flakes throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Texture is commonly gravelly sandy loam but the range includes sandy loam.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Coarse fragments range from 10 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is commonly gravelly sandy clay loam, but the range includes sandy clay loam and clay loam.  Clay ranges from 20 to 35 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  The reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 25 percent pebbles.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent pebbles."
