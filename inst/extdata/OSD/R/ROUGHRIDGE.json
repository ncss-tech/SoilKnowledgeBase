  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roughridge soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on convex crest, shoulder and backslope positions.  The majority of the precipitation occurs as snow, much of which is removed from the surface of the soil through wind action.  This removal of snow greatly reduces the effective precipitation on this soil relative to surrounding non-convex areas.  They formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.   Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,445 to 3,115 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
