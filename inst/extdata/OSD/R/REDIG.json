  "OVERVIEW": "The Redig series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvial material.  These soils are on ridges and upper slopes of rolling uplands.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 6 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils typically are calcareous to the surface, but are leached to 2 to 4 inches in some pedons.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is loam, clay loam or gravelly loam.  It is estimated to contain from 18 to 35 percent clay.  The amount of rock fragments ranges from 2 to 35 percent by volume throughout the 10- to 40-inch control section.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where the color value is as dark or darker than 5.5 dry or 3.5 moist, the A horizon is too thin for a mollic epipedon.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It commonly is clay loam or loam but is gravelly loam in some pedons.\nThe Ccs horizons have 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ccs horizons have an estimated 20 to 35 percent gypsum and 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The C horizon below depths of 40 inches contains as much as 60 percent by volume of rock fragments in some pedons.  The C horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline."
