  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils typically are calcareous to the surface, but are leached to 2 to 4 inches in some pedons.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is loam, clay loam or gravelly loam.  It is estimated to contain from 18 to 35 percent clay.  The amount of rock fragments ranges from 2 to 35 percent by volume throughout the 10- to 40-inch control section.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where the color value is as dark or darker than 5.5 dry or 3.5 moist, the A horizon is too thin for a mollic epipedon.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It commonly is clay loam or loam but is gravelly loam in some pedons.\nThe Ccs horizons have 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ccs horizons have an estimated 20 to 35 percent gypsum and 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The C horizon below depths of 40 inches contains as much as 60 percent by volume of rock fragments in some pedons.  The C horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redig soils are on gently sloping to steep, convex surfaces where terrace deposits are remnants that cap ridges and upper slopes of undulating to rolling uplands. Slope gradients range from 6 to 25 percent.  The soil formed in old alluvium containing sands, silts, clays, and rock fragments of mixed mineral origin.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches."

Schamber soils are on landscapes similar to the Redig soils.  Schamber soils have more than 35 percent by volume of rock fragments throughout the series control section."
