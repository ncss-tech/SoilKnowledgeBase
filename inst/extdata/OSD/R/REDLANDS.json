Aneth soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on hummocky, eolian mantled areas. Bluechief soils are moderately deep, do not have argillic horizons, and occur on benches and fan remnants. Mack soils are fine-loamy, have calcic horizons, and occur on fan remnants and mesas. Mariano soils are loamy-skeletal, have strong calcic horizons, and occur on fan remnants. Sogzie soils are coarse-loamy, have calcic horizons, and occur on mesas, undulating plateaus, and dipslopes of cuestas."
