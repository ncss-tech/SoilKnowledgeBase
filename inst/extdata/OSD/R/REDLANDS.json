  "OVERVIEW": "The Redlands series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Redlands soils are on fan remnants, mesas, and structural benches. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
