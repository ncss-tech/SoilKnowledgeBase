  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockysaddle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone, mudstone, and schist. Rockysaddle soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2290 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
