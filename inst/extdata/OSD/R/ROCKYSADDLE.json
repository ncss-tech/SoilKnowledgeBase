    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rockysaddle soils are on the sides of mountains in highly dissected terrain. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 85 to 972 meters (275 to 3185 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone, mudstone, and schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1900 to 2550 millimeters (75 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 240 to 290 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 35 centimeters (Oi, A & AB horizons)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 35 to 156 centimeters (BAt1, BAt2, Bt1, Bt2, & BCt horizons)\n3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of 32.8 percent in BCt horizon\n4. Humult feature - 1.30 percent organic carbon in the zone from 35 to 54 centimeters (BAt1)\n5. Palehumult feature - clay does not decrease by as much as 20 percent of its maximum within 150 centimeters of the ground surface\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 35 to 85 centimeters, averages 26 percent clay, by weight, and 57 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC / clay ratio averages 0.34.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil sample 88-RNP-11 was collected at the type location and analyzed at the Oregon State University soil-testing laboratory. University of California samples 60-CA-12-16X, 61-CA-12-20X and 62-CA-12-23X were collected from Rockysaddle pedons in Humboldt County outside of Redwood National Park, and reported by Begg, et al (1984).\nSource: 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
