The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes all or a part of the argillic horizon. The particle size control section has 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent rock fragments. The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. The AB horizon, when present, is ashy loam or ashy sandy loam. The A and AB horizons have 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent gravel with volcanic glass of 15 to 30 percent and estimated acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half acid oxalate iron of 0.2 to 0.4 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
