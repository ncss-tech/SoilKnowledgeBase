  "OVERVIEW": "The Raycreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in metasedimentary colluvium and residuum with volcanic ash in the surface. These soils are found on gentle sideslopes which border wet meadows. Slopes are 4 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
