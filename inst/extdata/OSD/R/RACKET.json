    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 24 to 60 or more inches. The particle size control section averages more than 20 percent sand coarser than very fine. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout the profile. The mean annual soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. They are commonly  silt loam or loam but in some places are silty clay loam. Chert and sandstone gravel content ranges from 0 to about 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 6. It has textures similar to the A horizon in the upper part but can also be gravelly silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or loam in the lower part.\nThe 2Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, or their gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues.\nThe 3Bw horizon, where present, has colors similar to the 2Bw horizon, but the texture is gravelly to extremely gravelly silty clay or clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is commonly stratified gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, and loam. Some pedons have C horizons that are loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam."

Dameron series have less than 20 percent sand coarser than very fine in the particle size control section and commonly have more clay and angular chert fragments in the substratum. Du Page soils are calcareous throughout. Deloit, Olmitz, Ross, Spillco, Spillville, Terril, and Turlin soils commonly have mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F, higher summer rainfall and formed at least partially in glacial sediments."
