  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to lithic contact is commonly less than 15 inches but ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  Matrix textures are loam or silt loam with 10 to 18 percent noncarbonate clay, 2 to 9 percent carbonate clay, and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are mainly channers and flagstones.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Hue is 7.5YR to 2.5YR.  The soil is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It has visible accumulations of carbonate, mainly as coatings on the undersides of rock fragments.  Calcium carbonate equivalent averages from 6 to 15 percent.  However, some pedons have thin, discontinuous accumulations which exceed 15 percent.\nThe R is hard limestone or hard, red, calcareous siltstone which is commonly several feet thick and underlain by soft, red sedimentary beds."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent and are commonly plainer.  Elevation is 5,400 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Buffcreek, Redbow, and Roughlock soils a have calcic horizon and do not have bedrock above a depth of 20 inches.  Also, Redbow and Roughlock soils are coarse-silty.   Redspear soils have a paralithic contact and are loamy."
