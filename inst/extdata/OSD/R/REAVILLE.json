  "OVERVIEW": "The Reaville series consists of moderately deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in residuum weathered from red Triassic, interbedded shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.  Mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of shale range from 2 to 30 percent in the Ap horizon, 2 to 45 percent in the Bt horizon, and from 30 to 90 percent in the C horizon; the weighted average is less than 35 percent by volume in the particle-size control section.  Where unlimed, the solum ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.  Illite is the dominant clay mineral, but the soil contains small amounts of kaolinite, vermiculite, and interstratified minerals.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has redoximorphic features with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Fine earth texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam."

Bogart soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the middle part of the series control section. Centerburg soils have lithic contact below 60 inches.  Cygnet and Jenera soils have more than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Haney and Thackery soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Houcktown soils have a densic contact within 60 inches. Jugtown soils are more alkaline than moderately acid in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Nicely soils are deeper than 50 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. Tuscola soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Vanlue soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Williamstown soils have rock fragments of dominantly limestone and crystalline lithology. Scattersville soils formed in mountain colluvium (solifluctate) from mixed basic and acidic rock materials in swales, broad interfluves, and on mountain footslopes at the base of the Blue Ridge. Swampoodle soils formed in local colluvium over residuum derived from greenstone schist, biotite schist, and basic gneiss. Swampoodle soils are more acid than neutral in the lower part of the series control section. Conowingo, Lehigh, Mount Lucas, Vaughnsville soils are family related soils."
