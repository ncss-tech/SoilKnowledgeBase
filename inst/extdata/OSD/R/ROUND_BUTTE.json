  "OVERVIEW": "The Round Butte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in strongly alkaline, varved, clayey lacustrine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
