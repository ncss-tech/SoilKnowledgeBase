  "OVERVIEW": "The Reina series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to an indurated hardpan.  Reina soils formed in residuum derived from andesite, basalt, quartzite, and tuff with a component of volcanic ash and loess.  Reina soils are on summits and side slopes of bench areas, plateaus, and foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
