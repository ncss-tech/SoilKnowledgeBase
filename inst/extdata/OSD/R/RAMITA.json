  "OVERVIEW": "The Ramita series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slow permeable soils.  These soils formed in sandy eolian deposits over loamy quaternary alluvium on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).",

The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for less than 120 cumulative days in normal years.  November through April are the driest months, with a second low in July, while September is the wettest.  Although rainfall amounts are that of an ustic moisture regime, the effective precipitation is higher because the soil is in a water receiving position.  A water table is present in most pedons at depths of 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in) in most years from November through April.
