    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil Moisture: An aquic soil moisture regime bordering on udic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for less than 120 cumulative days in normal years.  November through April are the driest months, with a second low in July, while September is the wettest.  Although rainfall amounts are that of an ustic moisture regime, the effective precipitation is higher because the soil is in a water receiving position.  A water table is present in most pedons at depths of 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in) in most years from November through April.  This is due to reduced evapotranspiration levels and the lateral flow of water through the soil after the heaviest rainfall month of September.\nDepth to natric horizon: 10 to 46 cm (4 to 18 in)\nDepth to secondary calcium carbonate: 76 to 203 cm (30 to more than 80 in)\nDepth to redox concentrations: 10 to 46 cm (4 to 18 in)\nDepth to redox depletions or reduced matrix: 10 to 89 cm (4 to 35 in)\nDepth to episaturation: 31 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in), in most years, from November to April.\nParticle-size control section (weighted average)\nClay content: 18 to 28 percent\nSand content: 65 to 74 percent\nCEC/clay ratio: .40 to .60\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: fine sand or loamy fine sand\nClay content: 2 to 10 percent\nRedox concentrations: amount- none to common, size- fine, contrast- faint or distinct, and boundary- clear or distinct.\nEC (dS/m): 0 to 2\nSAR: 3 to 10\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral\nE horizon\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 5 to 7\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: fine sand or loamy fine sand\nClay content: 2 to 10 percent\nRedox concentrations: amount- none to common, size- fine or medium, contrast- faint or distinct, boundary- clear or distinct.\nEC (dS/m): 0 to 2\nSAR: 3 to 10\nReaction: moderately acid to neutral\nSome pedons do not have E horizons.\nBtn1 horizon\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 3 to 6\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam\nClay content: 16 to 25 percent\nRedox concentrations: amount- few to many, size- fine or medium, contrast- faint to prominent, boundary- clear or distinct.\nRedox depletions: amount- none to common, size- fine or medium, contrast- faint or distinct, boundary- clear or distinct.\nEC (dS/m): 0 to 4\nSAR: 6 to 23\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline\nBtn2 horizon\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 5 to 7\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: sandy clay loam\nClay content: 20 to 28 percent\nRedox concentrations: amount- few to many, size- fine or medium, contrast- faint to prominent, boundary- clear or distinct.\nRedox depletions: amount- none to common, size- fine or medium, contrast- faint, boundary- clear or distinct.\nEC (dS/m): 0 to 8\nSAR: 13 to 35\nReaction: neutral to strongly alkaline\nLower Btn horizon\nHue: 10YR to 5Y\nValue: 6 to 8\nChroma: 1 to 3\nTexture: sandy clay loam\nClay content: 20 to 28 percent\nRedox concentrations: amount-few to many, size- fine or medium, contrast- faint to prominent, boundary- clear or distinct.\nRedox depletions: amount- none to many, size- fine or medium, boundary- faint or distinct.\nEC (dS/m): 4 to 10\nSAR: 13 to 56\nReaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline\nFew to many masses and nodules of calcium carbonate and gypsum crystals.\n2Btkn or 2Btkny horizon\nHue: 10YR to 5Y\nValue: 6 to 8\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: sandy clay loam\nClay content: 20 to 35 percent\nRedox concentrations: amount- few to many, size- fine or medium, contrast- faint to prominent, boundary- clear or distinct.\nRedox depletions: amount- none to common, size- fine or medium, contrast- faint or distinct, boundary- clear or distinct.\nEC (dS/m): 8 to 20\nSAR: 30 to 60\nReaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline\nThere are a few to many, masses and nodules of calcium carbonate, gypsum, and other salts."
