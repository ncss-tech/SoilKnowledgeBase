Conconully soils have a C horizon in the lower part of the particle-size control section that is dense and hard when dry.  Crouch soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 55 degrees F.  Donavan, Hellgate, and Phoebe soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Fanal soils have mottles in the lower part of the B and in the C horizons.  Owhi soils are sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Picard soils have 0 to 10 percent pebbles in the particle-size control section.
