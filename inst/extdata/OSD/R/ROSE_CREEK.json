  "OVERVIEW": "The Rose Creek series consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Rose Creek soils are on natural levees, flood plains, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The soils formed in stratified alluvium derived from mixed rocks including volcanic and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes are dominantly less than 0.5 percent but range up to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,074 meters.  The climate is arid or semiarid with mean annual precipitation of 150 to 250 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Ocala soils lack a mollic epipedon and have weak silica-cemented strata.  Sonoma soils lack a mollic epipedon and are fine-silty."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; low surface runoff;  high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The water table ranges from 50 to 90 cm during the spring runoff period but may drop to 150 to 250 cm during the early fall months when the river flow drops markedly.  Some areas have been partially drained by entrenchment of stream channels. The soils are subject to flooding on an average of at least 1 out of 3 years and often receive deposition of new soil materials."
