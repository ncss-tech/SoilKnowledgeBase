  "OVERVIEW": "The Reck series consists of very deep, well drained very slowly permeable soils on broad ridges and mountain sideslopes. They formed in slope alluvium from quartzite and occur in areas having evidence of mass movement. Slopes are 5 to 35 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 340 millimeters and average annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
