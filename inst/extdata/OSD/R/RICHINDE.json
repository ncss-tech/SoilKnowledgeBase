  "OVERVIEW": "The Richinde series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff. Richinde soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Checkett soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments in the control section, and the Bt horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline. Chubard soils have 50 to 75 percent rock fragments and 18 to 27 percent clay.\nCottle soils have thin Btkq horizons. Gabbvally soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C.\nRowel soils contain 50 to 80 percent coarse fragments and average 40 to 55 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Stewval soils are very shallow or shallow to a lithic contact and have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 12 to 15 degrees C. Thike soils have more than one-half the gravel which are 2 to 5 mm in size and the sand fraction is dominantly coarse sand."
