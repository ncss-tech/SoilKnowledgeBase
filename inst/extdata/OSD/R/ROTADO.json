They formed in eolian material over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary Age Bandelier Tuff formation.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,900 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Tocal soils are clayey, shallow, and occur on shoulders of interfluves. Urioste soils are ashy, very shallow, and occur on backslopes of interfluves."
