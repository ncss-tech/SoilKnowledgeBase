  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rooting depth is more than 80 inches.  Dredging or dragline operations have mixed the materials which have been randomly deposited and smoothed with a dozer into a layer that ranges from 5 to 10 feet thick.  These soils are made up of sandy and loamy materials. The weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 3 to 18 percent.  The control section has more than 50 percent sand that is fine or coarse sand.  Reaction is mildly to strongly alkaline and is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Most pedons contain few to common hard concretions of calcium carbonate, black concretions and micro flakes.  Some pedons contain 2 to 15 percent by volume siliceous pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The textures are variable and mixed, but composite textures are fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR to 5Y; value of 3 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Thin strata and fragments of clayey materials are in some horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Grayrock and Marklake series. Grayrock soils have a fine-silty control section.  Marklake soils have fine-loamy control sections.  These soils are forming in deposits that have been reworked during lignite mining operations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Riolomas soils are on convex areas bordering dredged river and creek channels.  These soils are forming in dredged deposits from sandy and loamy alluvium.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent with convex or undulating surfaces.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 68 to 70 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is about 36 to 46 inches.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices range from about 48 to 66."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Asa, Brazoria, Clemville, and Norwood series.  The Asa and Brazoria soils are higher in the landscape.  Brazoria soils have very-fine control sections.  The Asa, Clemville, and Norwood soils have fine-silty control sections and the Asa soils have dark colored surface layers.  Clemville and Norwood soils are in similar positions in the landscape but have smoother surfaces."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.  Permeability may be slower in areas where clayey strata are nearer the surface."
