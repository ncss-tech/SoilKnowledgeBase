  "OVERVIEW": "The Rushford series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of till underlain with silty lacustrine deposits. These soils contain a dense fragipan. They are on elevated lake plains and end moraines. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral soil above the fragipan, low to moderately high in the fragipan, and moderately high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm.",

Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in the mineral surface layer and upper part of the subsoil and from 0 to 5 percent in the lower part of the subsoil and substratum. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral throughout the mineral soil, generally increasing with depth.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Thickness of the Ap horizon, where present, ranges from 10 to 22 cm thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bx horizon has hue, value and chroma similar to the Bw horizon. Fine earth texture is loam or silt loam. Structure is coarse or very coarse prismatic with platy, blocky or massive interiors. Consistence is firm or very firm and brittle.\nThe 2Bx horizon, when present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma or 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silt. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt or silt loam, and may contain thin varves of silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. The material has plate like divisions, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

All of these series lack the nearly rock fragment free 2Bx and 2C horizon.\nThe Canaseraga, Langford, Marilla, and Williamson series are similar soils in related families. Canaseraga and Williamson soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections. Langford soils have an argillic horizon. Marilla soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rushford soils are gently sloping to sloping soils on elevated lake plains and end moraines in valleys. Slope ranges from 3 to 35 percent. The soils formed in till derived mainly from siltstone, fine-grained sandstone and shale that overlies lacustrine silts. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1143 mm; mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost free season ranges from 110 to 150 days. These soils are at elevations that range from 274 to 518 m above sea level."

Allard soils are associated in areas underlain with stratified sand and gravel. Dalton and Volusia soils are in associated low areas and are somewhat poorly drained. Valois soils are in nearby rolling landscapes and lack a fragipan layer. Williamson soils are in the coarse-silty family."
