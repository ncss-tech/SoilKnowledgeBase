  "OVERVIEW": "The Rafter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed stream and fan alluvium. Rafter soils are on stream terraces, flood plains, and alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
