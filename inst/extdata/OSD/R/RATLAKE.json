The particle-size control section is 22 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bgkzn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is 0 to 15 percent hard durinodes.\nThe Bkqm horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist.  This horizon is strongly cemented to indurated."

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,100 to 1,350 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
