  "OVERVIEW": "The Ratlake series consists of shallow, poorly drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with some additions of recent alluvium. These soils are in closed depressions on valley flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are commonly saturated from the surface to the duripan from January until June.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is 22 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bgkzn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is 0 to 15 percent hard durinodes.\nThe Bkqm horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist.  This horizon is strongly cemented to indurated."
