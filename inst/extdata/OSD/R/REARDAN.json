  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon  - the zone from 0 to 15 inches (Ap and Bw horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 18 to 37 inches (Btb and Btkb horizons)\nSecondary carbonates - the zone from 31 to 60 inches (Btkb and Bkqb horizons)\nDurinodes - the zone from 37 to 60 inches (Bkqb horizon)\nParticle Size Control Section - the zone from 18 to 37 inches (Btb and Btkb horizon)\nIn 2006, the original type location was visited and found not to have a mollic eippedon and had duripan features. In light of these findings, the type location was moved to the current location to better represent the Reardan concept mapped during the Spokane County update.\nIn 2010, the Reardan series was reclassified from a Fine, mixed, superactive, Calcic Argixeroll to a Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Palexeroll due to a clay increase of 20 percent (absolute) within a vertical distance of less than 3 inches.\nMLRA update investigation needed: the Reardan series mapped in Lincoln County needs to be investigated to confirm an abrupt textural change (Palexeroll criteria), the presence of durinodes and extent and influence of volcanic ash in surface layers and glaciofluvial parent materials.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
