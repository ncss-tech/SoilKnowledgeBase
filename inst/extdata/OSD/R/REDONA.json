  "OVERVIEW": "The Redona series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in moderately fine textured calcareous alluvium derived from red siltstone, shale, and sandstone of Triassic age.  These soils are on hillslopes, alluvial fan terraces, and valley side slopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
