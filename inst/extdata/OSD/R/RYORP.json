The Bw and upper C horizons have about 12 to 18 percent clay. The soil has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It is slightly to medium acid. Depth to sandstone bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Sandstone and cherty sandstone fragments range from 1 to 30 percent of the soil volume above sandstone rock."

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
