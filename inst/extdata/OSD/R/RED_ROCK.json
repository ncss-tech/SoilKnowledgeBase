  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 47 to 55 F., and the average summer temperature is 68 to 74 F. The soil is usually moist.  It is moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than one-half of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. in 7 out of 10 years. The soils is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe mollic epipedon is 20 to 48 or more inches thick.  Organic matter content decreases irregularly or remains above 0.5 percent to a depth of 50 inches. The series control section averages about 18 to 27 percent clay and contains less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Base saturation percentage is about 85 to 100.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3. It is neutral to slightly alkaline. This horizon is dominantly noncalcareous but some recharging of lime has occurred in the surface plow layer in some pedons making it slightly calcareous.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from fine sandy loam to clay loam and is stratified at depths below 36 inches in some pedons. This horizon is slightly to strongly alkaline and slightly to moderately calcareous, with less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Caldwell soils are noncalcareous throughout, and are somewhat poorly drained and contain mottles below 40 inches.  Harana soils have a particle size control section that contains 27 to 35 percent clay.  Jett soils are calcareous throughout.  Keigley soils are strongly calcareous throughout with 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and lack Bw horizons.  Loupence soils are noncalcareous throughout, receive 8 to 10 inches annual precipitation,and are dry more than half the time in the moisture control section.  Rustico soils have annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches and the control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  Snow soils are calcareous throughout and have slightly hard consistence."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Red Rock soils occur on alluvial fans, stream terraces and lake terraces at elevations of 4,300 to 5,800 feet. Slopes are most commonly 0 to 3 percent and range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium or reworked lacustrine deposits. The climate is dry subhumid with 12 to 16 inches of annual precipitation and 90 to 140 frost free days.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F."
