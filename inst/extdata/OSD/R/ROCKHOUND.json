    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clegorpass (CA) and Oldale (CA) series. Both of these soils have a soil moisture control section that is moist in some part for 10 to 20 days, cumulative, between July and September and mean annual soil temperatures less than 25 degrees C, typical for soils in MLRA 30. In addition, Clegorpass soils have gypsum present within the particle-size control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rockhound soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Elevations range from 320 to 615 meters (1,050 to 2,015 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 26 degrees C (73.5 to 79 degrees F). The frost-free season is 360 to 365 days."
