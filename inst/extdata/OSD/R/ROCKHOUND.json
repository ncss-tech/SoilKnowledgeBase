  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockhound series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Rockhound soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 millimeters (3 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 24.5 degrees C (76 degrees F).",
