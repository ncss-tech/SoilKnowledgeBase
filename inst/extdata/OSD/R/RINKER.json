These soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 45 to 47 degrees F. Phyllite fragments in the particle-size control section range from 50 to 70 percent by weighted average.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Some pedons lack an E horizon.  Reaction is extremely acid, very strongly acid, or strongly acid.\nThe BS horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very channery silt loam or very channery loam.  Phyllite fragments range from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction is extremely acid, very strongly acid, or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.

Cupples and Montborne soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Danforth, Oakes, and Sorensen soils lack a lithic contact within depths of 40 inches.

These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium and slope alluvium from phyllite with some glacial till.  The average annual precipitation is 65 to 80 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  Average January temperature is 33 degrees F. and average July temperature is 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
