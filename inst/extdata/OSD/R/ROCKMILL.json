    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rockmill soils are on flood plains or in depressional areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in alluvium and the underlying organic soil material. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 178 days. Elevation is 238 to 250 meters (780 to 820 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Algiers, Carlisle, Muskego, and Sloan soils. The somewhat poorly drained Algiers soils formed entirely in mineral deposits on flood plains. The very poorly drained Carlisle and Muskego soils formed in organic deposits on depressions. The very poorly drained Sloan soils formed in mineral deposits on floodplains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the mineral part and high or very high in the organic part. Permeability is moderate in the mineral part and moderately rapid or rapid in the organic part. Flooding and ponding is common for brief periods from September through June."
