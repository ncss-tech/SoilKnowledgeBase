  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockmill series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium and the underlying organic soil material on flood plains or in depressional areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the mineral part and high or very high in the organic part. Permeability is moderate in the mineral part and moderately rapid or rapid in the organic part. Flooding and ponding is common for brief periods from September through June."
