  "OVERVIEW": "The Roy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from sandstone and igneous rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, escarpments, mountains, and hills. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
