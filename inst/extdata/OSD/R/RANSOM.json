  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates is 22 to 40 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 22 inches. The depth of the loess is 24 to 40 inches. Coarse fragments typically are lacking in the upper mantle, but they comprise 2 to 8 percent of horizons in glacial till. A stone line as thick as 5 inches and containing as much as 20 percent of coarse fragments is at the base of the upper mantle in some pedons. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages between 22 and 35 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2BCk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5. It is loam or clay loam.  It has weak coarse prismatic structure. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 5. It is loam or clay loam.  It has weak coarse prismatic structure.

Amana soils lack coarse fragments and do not have carbonates above 60 inches.  Breeds soils have a paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Grantcenter, Joyce, Kingston soils do not have coarse fragments above a depth of 60 inches.  Larpenteur soils have carbonates above 22 inches.  Nerwood soils do not have carbonates above 40 inches.  Primghar soils formed completely in loess and do not have coarse fragments above 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ransom soils have plane or convex slopes. They typically are on topography with a dendritic drainage system. Slopes typically are long and uniform. Slope gradients range from 1 to 3 percent. These soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of loess and calcareous firm fine-loamy glacial till. A thin stone line commonly separates the loess from the till. The climate is midcontinental with warm summers and cold winters. Mean annual temperature is approximately 45 to 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 28 inches."

The well drained Sac soils and the poorly drained Rushmore soils formed in similar materials, and are in a drainage sequence with the Ransom soils. The well drained Everly soils lack or have a thinner silty surface layer. The Marcus soils have formed entirely in loess and are poorly drained."
