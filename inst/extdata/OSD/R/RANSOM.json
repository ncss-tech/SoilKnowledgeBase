  "OVERVIEW": "The Ransom series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess over calcareous glacial till on ground moraines. The soils have a moderate to moderately slow permeability. They have slopes of 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Coarse fragments typically are lacking in the upper mantle, but they comprise 2 to 8 percent of horizons in glacial till. A stone line as thick as 5 inches and containing as much as 20 percent of coarse fragments is at the base of the upper mantle in some pedons.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ransom soils have plane or convex slopes. They typically are on topography with a dendritic drainage system. Slopes typically are long and uniform. Slope gradients range from 1 to 3 percent. These soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of loess and calcareous firm fine-loamy glacial till. A thin stone line commonly separates the loess from the till. The climate is midcontinental with warm summers and cold winters. Mean annual temperature is approximately 45 to 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 28 inches."

The well drained Everly soils lack or have a thinner silty surface layer. The Marcus soils have formed entirely in loess and are poorly drained."
