  "OVERVIEW": "The Regracic series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium from sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. Regracic soils are on relict stream terraces on valley floors. Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
