  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 8 to 30 inches. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 30 inches. Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 10 to 35 inches, but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons.  ESP either remains constant or increases with depth, ranging from 0 to 15 percent in the solum but exceeds 15 percent in the Cca horizon of some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the paralithic contact and they are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 1OYR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically loam or clay loam, but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has about 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

At the type location these soils occur at elevations in excess of 8,000 feet.  They formed in medium to moderately fine textured calcareous reddish brown sediments weathered from underlying redbed shales and sandstones.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 56 degrees F."
