  "OVERVIEW": "The Rawnjay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits, alluvium and colluvium.  Rawnjay soils are on lake terraces, lake terrace escarpments, or stream terraces.  Slopes range from 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
