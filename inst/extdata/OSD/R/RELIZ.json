  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact of hard bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. Depth to bedrock is variable within short distances. The soil below a depth of about 5 inches usually is dry in all parts from May until late November or early December and usually is moist the remainder of the year. The mean annual soil temperature is 61 degrees to 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 7/2, 7/3, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 7/2, 7/3, 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3. Moist color is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/1, 4/2 or 4/3. Texture is very channery loam, very channery clay loam or channery clay loam. Channer content is 30 to 50 percent. Reaction is medium acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ranchoseco series. Ranchoseco series (MLRA 17), on hills with mound, intermound microrelief, have a lithic contact at a depth of 4 to 10 inches and are formed in dark metamorphic and quartzitic gravelly and cobbly alluvium from mixed rock sources."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Reliz soils are on mountainous uplands. Slope is 30 to 75 percent. Elevation is 500 to 3,400 feet. They formed in residuum weathered from Monterey shale. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 55 inches. The average January temperature is 48 degrees F., average July temperature is about 68 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees to 62 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 200 to 250 days."

Chamise soils, on hills and dissected terraces, do not have a lithic contact and have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section. Gazos, Linne and San Benito soils, on hills, have a mollic epipedon and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Lopez soils, on narrow divides, have a mollic epipedon. Los Osos soils, on uplands, are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, have a mollic epipedon and a fine particle-size control section. Santa Lucia soils, on uplands, are moderately deep to a lithic contact, have a mollic epipedon and a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Range in Characteristics for this series does not include Reliz families mapped in map units 28 and 40 on the Los Padres National Forest Soil Survey.\nA Reliz Variant soil was sampled in Sacramento County as S82CA-067-005 and then correlated to Ranchoseco Variant. Ranchoseco soil is the only competing series with Reliz (prior to assignment of a Cation-Exchange Activity Class). This NSSL lab data had a CEC/Clay Ratio of 0.75, 0.68 and 0.53 from the surface to a lithic contact, however there was a pronounced clay increase from 15 to 18 centimeters in a 2Bt horizon in this soil that had the lowest CEC/Clay Ratio.\nReliz series was assigned an \"active\" Cation-Exchange Activity Class in 2/2003 based on soil reaction and the nature of Monterey Shale Formation parent material. This should be investigated further.\nFormer Competing Series included Amador, Calleguas, Cieneba, Daulton, Etsel, Exchequer, Friant, Gaviota, Hideaway, Lodi, Lopez, Maymen and Whiterock series. Amador, Calleguas, Cieneba, Daulton, Exchequer, Friant, Gaviota, Maymen and Whiterock soils, on uplands, hills or mountains, have a loamy particle-size control section. Etsel soils (MLRA's 5 and 15), on mountains, have a mesic soil temperature regime. Hideaway soils, on nearly level to rolling relief, have an acid reaction class. Lodi soils, on uplands, have a clayey particle-size control section. Lopez soils, on narrow divides, have a mollic epipedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
