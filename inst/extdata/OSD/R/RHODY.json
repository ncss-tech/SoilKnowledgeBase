Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 50 to 100 centimeters and depth to lithic contact ranges from 64 to 114 centimeters. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 25 in the 2C horizons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. Some pedons do not have a 3Cr horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 2.5, and chroma of 1. It is mucky silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A/E horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. They are sand or gravelly sand. Reaction is neutral."

Deerton soils are moderately deep, well drained sandy soils, and are on knolls, ridges and on shoulders of bedrock benches. Garlic and Grand Sable soils are very deep, well drained sandy soils on nearby uplands. Lupton soils are very deep, very poorly drained organic soils, occurring in nearby depressions and drainageways. Towes soils are moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are in a drainage catena with Rhody soils. Trout Bay soils are very poorly drained organic soils over bedrock, and are in nearby depressions and drainageways."
