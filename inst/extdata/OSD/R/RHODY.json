  "OVERVIEW": "The Rhody series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty eolian deposits overlying sandy outwash. These soils are on eroded bedrock terraces within glacial drainage channels. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and high in the silty eolian deposit and high and very high in the sandy outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
