  "OVERVIEW": "The Reis series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey till on lake plains.  Some areas have a thin mantle of lacustrine sediments over the till.  Reis soils are on very slight rises on broad lake plains having microrelief.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils have slow permeability.  The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

The classification of this series is in question as to whether it should be in the Typic or Aeric subgroup of Calciaquerts.  This needs further study.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:  mollic epipedon - from 0 to 17 inches, (Ap horizon and A portion of the A/Bk horizon); calcic horizon - 9 to 42 inches, (A/Bk, Bkss1, Bkss2 and Bkg horizons); Vertisol criteria - cracks filled with A material extend to 33 inches and range in width from 1/2 to 3 inches and slickensides (Bkss1 and Bkss2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MN.
