    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches and can include part of the A/Bk horizon.  Depth to the calcic is 16 inches or less with carbonates at the surface in most pedons.  The content of rock fragments ranges from 1 to 10 percent throughout.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent noncarbonate clay with an average of 50 percent noncarbonate clay and 5 to 20 percent sand.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, chroma of 0 to 2.  Typically it is clay or silty clay, and less commonly clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  It ranges from 30 to 60 percent noncarbonate clay and 3 to 15 percent sand.  Effervescence is slight to violent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons cracks filled with A material extend to depths of 40 inches.\nThe Bkss and Bkg horizons have hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2,  Chroma of 2 is allowed if there are redoximorphic concentrations present.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Effervescence is strong or violent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have Bg horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mixings or masses of chroma of 3 to 5.  There are distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations present.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Effervescence is slight to strong.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5.  There are distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations present.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Effervescence is slight to strong.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have masses of gypsum crystals.  Some pedons have clay loam till within a depth of 36 inches."

These soils formed in clayey, calcareous glacial till of Late Wisconsinan age.  Some areas have a thin mantle of lacustrine sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 23 inches with 80 to 85 percent accumulating in April to October.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation ranges from 750 to 1150 feet."

The Reis soils are usually found in complex with these associated soils on slightly higher, slightly convex rises.  Clearwater and Viking soils do not have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was previously included within the Hegne series.  The classification of this series is in question as to whether it should be in the Typic or Aeric subgroup of Calciaquerts.  This needs further study.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:  mollic epipedon - from 0 to 17 inches, (Ap horizon and A portion of the A/Bk horizon); calcic horizon - 9 to 42 inches, (A/Bk, Bkss1, Bkss2 and Bkg horizons); Vertisol criteria - cracks filled with A material extend to 33 inches and range in width from 1/2 to 3 inches and slickensides (Bkss1 and Bkss2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MN.  Agr.  Exp.  Sta.  CFC No.  3731 for results of analysis of a representative pedon. Interpretation Record: MN0739\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
