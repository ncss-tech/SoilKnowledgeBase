  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sulfur content is greater than 0.75 percent in some horizons within 40 inches of the surface.  The organic layers of the control section are dominantly sapric materials with hemic materials in layers of some pedons.  Fibric materials are in the surface tier of some pedons.  Mineral strata are in the control section below the surface tier.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through moderately alkaline throughout the profile.  After drying, reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.  Conductivity of the saturation extract of layers at depths below about 6 inches is 2 to 16 mmho/cm.\nThe organic materials within all tiers have hue of 10YR through 5GY or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  They are muck or mucky peat.  Rubbed fiber content commonly is 3 to 15 percent but ranges to 60 percent.  The n value commonly is greater than 1.0, but ranges from 0.7 to 2.0.\nThe mineral strata have hue of 10YR through 5GY or are neutral, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2.  They range from silt loam through clay in the surface and subsurface tiers and include sandy loam and loamy sand in the bottom tier.  The n value commonly is less than 1.0, but ranges from less than 0.4 to 2.0."

The Allemands, Axis, Backbay, Bohicket, Capers, Carteret, Currituck, Delcomb, Handsboro, Hobonny, Kenner, Lafitte, Maurepas, Pocaty and Tisonia series are in closely related families. Allemands, Currituck, Delcomb, Hobonny, Kenner, Lafitte, and Maurepas soils have no sulfidic materials within 40 inches of the surface.  Handsboro and Tisonia soils have saturation extract conductivity greater than 16 mmho/cm and are inundated daily with sea water.  Pocaty soils do not have mineral layers thicker than 12 inches in the control section.  Axis, Backbay, Bohicket, Capers, and Carteret are mineral soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rappahannock soils are on tidal marshs along the larger tidal creeks and rivers of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Elevations are approximately sea level.  The soils formed in stratified highly decomposed herbaceous plant remains and fluvial sediments deposited in areas subject to daily inundation with brackish water.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature near the type location is 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Enoree, Levy, Mantachee, Pamunkey, Rumford, State, and Tetotum soils.  All of these soils are mineral soils and lack sulfidic materials.  In addition, the Pamunkey, Rumford, State, and Tetotum soils are better drained and are on higher elevations.  Enoree, Levy, and Mantachee soils normally do not flood daily."
