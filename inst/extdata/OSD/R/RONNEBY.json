    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes on drumlins or moraines. Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. Ronneby soils formed in noncalcareous, Superior lobe dense loamy glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature is about 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1450 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Milaca, Mora, and Parent soils, which form a drainage sequence with the Ronneby soils. Milaca soils are moderately well drained and are on more sloping terrain. The somewhat poorly drained Mora soils are on higher lying positions. The poorly and very poorly drained Parent soils are on lower positions on the landscape occupying flats, swales or depressions."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part and very slow in the dense till. This soil has perched seasonal high saturation at a depth of 0.5 feet during April to June in years of normal precipitation."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 11 inches (Ap and E horizon); albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 11 inches (E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 33 inches (B/E and Bt horizons); glossic horizon-zone from 11 to 17 inches (B/E horizon); base saturation is above 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon; aquic conditions- based on presumed positive reaction with alpha alpha dipyridyl at sometime during the year in most years. This parent material does not reduce soil colors typical of other parent material; densic contact- the zone beginning at 45 inches (BCd horizon). This soil was formerly classified as coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, Udollic Epiaqualfs. Classification changed to reflect predomenance of a glossic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: See National Soil Survey Lab 563MN-5-5 for data on the typical pedon. Soil Interpretation Record Number is MN0247.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
