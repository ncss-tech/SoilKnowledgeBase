  "OVERVIEW": "The Ritner series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey colluvium derived from basalt dominantly from the Siletz River Volcanics Formation. Ritner soils occur on broad ridgetops and side slopes of foothills and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 55 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice within MLRA 2 but ranges to 90 days in MLRA 5.  Depth to the fractured bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section is 35 to 50 percent clay and has 35 to 75 percent total rock fragments. The amount of rock fragments ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the upper part of the solum to between 35 and 75 percent in the lower part of the Bw horizon, increasing with depth. Rock fragments range in size from gravel to stones. An ochric epipedon that has a moist chroma of 4 is at a depth of less than 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. This horizon, in pedons with chroma of 2 or 3 moist is less than 1/3 thickness of the solum. Texture is silty clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 10 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones. Reaction is moderately acid.\nThe BA horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay. It has 10 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones. Reaction is moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay, clay or heavy silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 15 to 35 percent gravel, 15 to 45 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid."

Slopes are 2 to 90 percent. Elevation is 240 to 2,200 feet. The soils formed in clayey colluvium derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The January temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F. and the July temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
