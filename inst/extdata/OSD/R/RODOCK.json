These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,300 to 1,800 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."
