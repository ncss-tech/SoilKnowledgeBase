  "OVERVIEW": "The Rodock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of loess and volcanic ash.  The Rodock soils are on inset fans, fan aprons, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
