    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 days during the summer.  Cemented stony layers occur at depths of 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F.  The control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 50 to 80 percent.  Few boulders are on the surface and in the profile in most areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam.  This horizon has 10 to 20 percent stones and 15 to 25 percent each of cobbles and pebbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy loam.  It has 15 to 25 percent each of stones and cobbles, and 25 to 35 percent pebbles."

These soils formed in very cobbly medium and moderately fine textured glacial outwash material from basalt and andesite.  The climate is subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 30 to 45 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 to 51 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 31 to 34 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F.
