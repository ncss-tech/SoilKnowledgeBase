  "OVERVIEW": "The Redpen series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvium and fan alluvium derived from sandstone and shale on fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Balon and Decolney soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Penistaja soils are not calcareous in all parts.  Bowbac, Cerropelon, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Pokeman, Pugsley and Spangler soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Buckle, Harbord, Oelop, Palacid and Quagwa soils have less than 40 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Blancot, Doakum, Fort, Mentmore, and Yenlo soils typically have hue yellower than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Chilerojo soils are very deep to a densic horizon. Cumacho soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Sundance soils have buried paleosol horizons.  Teckla soils contain 35 to 70 percent porcelanite rock fragments below a 20 to 40 inch depth.  In addition, the Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Decolney, Forkwood, Fort, Hagerman, Hiland, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance, Tekla and Yenlo series are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."
