The soil formed in alluvium derived predominantly from tuffaceous sediments of the Duff and Pruett Formations, with rock fragments derived from the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches, with most occurring from July through September.  Mean annual air temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 280 days.  Elevation ranges from 2,500 to 4,500 feet."

Beewon and Quadria soils are on mid-Pleistocene pediments and have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Borunda soils are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock, are in the fine-loamy family, and have calcic and gypsic horizons.  Borunda soils occur on higher erosional slopes and pediments.  Musgrave soils are very shallow or shallow to tuffaceous bedrock, are in the clayey family, and are on higher erosional scarps and uplands.  Straddlebug soils are on lower Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains."
