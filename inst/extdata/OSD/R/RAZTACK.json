    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Raztack soils are on depressions on lakebeds. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,460 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6.5 to 7.5 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
