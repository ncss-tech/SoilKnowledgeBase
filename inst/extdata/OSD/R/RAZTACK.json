  "OVERVIEW": "The Raztack series consists of deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Raztack soils are on depressions on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
