  "REVDATE": "04/2008",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Readlyn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying till. Readlyn soils are on slightly convex side slopes on dissected till plains of low relief on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
