  "OVERVIEW": "The Reelow series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and glacial drift over a duripan with an influence of loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. They are on old uplifted fan remnants, old terraces and old till plains. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
