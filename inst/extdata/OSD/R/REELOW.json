These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the A or Ap horizons. The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. The depth to an extremely or very gravelly moderately cemented iron-silica duripan is 10 to 20 inches. Base saturation is more than 75 percent. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches and includes the argillic horizon. The upper 2 to 7 inches has a volcanic glass content of 15 to 25 percent acid-oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.25 to 0.6 percent, and 5 to 10 percent 15-bar moisture.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe BA horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is ashy clay loam, gravelly ashy clay loam, or ashy loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It is gravelly clay or gravelly clay loam. It has 15 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.\nThe 3Bstqm horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist. It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.\nThe 3Bsqm horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist. It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.\nThe 3Bs horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Reelow soils are on old uplifted fan remnants, old terraces and old till plains. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and glacial drift over a duripan with an influence of loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. Elevation is 1,700 to 3,100 feet. Climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
