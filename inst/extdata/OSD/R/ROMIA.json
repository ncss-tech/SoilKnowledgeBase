  "OVERVIEW": "The Romia series consists of deep, well drained, moderately\npermeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone\nof Cretaceous age.  These soils are on sideslopes or crests of\nridges on gently sloping to moderately steep uplands in the\nSouthern Coastal Plains.  Water runs off the surface slow to\nrapid.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.",

Cobbly and gravelly phases are\nrecognized.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through strongly acid.  The volume of pebbles less than 3 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 15 percent, and those greater than 3 inches in diameter range from 2 to 15 percent.\nThe B2t horizon has hues of 2.5YR or 5YR, with values of 4 or 5,\nand chromas of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the B2t horizon has reddish, yellowish, or brownish mottles in most pedons.  Grayish mottles occur below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons.  The fine earth fraction of the B2t horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Gravelly phases are recognized.  The volume of pebbles less than 3 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through very strongly acid.\nThe Cr horizon is rippable sandstone and, in some pedons, is laminated with bands of ironstone."
