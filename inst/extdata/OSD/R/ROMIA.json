    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to sandstone range from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A1 horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, with values of 3 to 5,\nand chromas of 2 to 4.\nThe A2 horizon has hues of 5YR to 10YR, with values of 5 or 6, and chromas or 2 to 4.\nThe fine earth fraction of the A horizon is fine sandy loam, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  Cobbly and gravelly phases are\nrecognized.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through strongly acid.  The volume of pebbles less than 3 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 15 percent, and those greater than 3 inches in diameter range from 2 to 15 percent.\nThe B2t horizon has hues of 2.5YR or 5YR, with values of 4 or 5,\nand chromas of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the B2t horizon has reddish, yellowish, or brownish mottles in most pedons.  Grayish mottles occur below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons.  The fine earth fraction of the B2t horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Gravelly phases are recognized.  The volume of pebbles less than 3 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through very strongly acid.\nThe Cr horizon is rippable sandstone and, in some pedons, is laminated with bands of ironstone."

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Romia soils occur on gently sloping to moderately steep uplands on sideslopes or crests of ridges.\nSlopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in sandy and loamy materials weathered from sandstone.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  Mean annual\ntemperature ranges from 62 degrees to 70 degrees F."
