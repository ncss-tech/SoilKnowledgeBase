These soils formed in clayey lacustrine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 130 days."
