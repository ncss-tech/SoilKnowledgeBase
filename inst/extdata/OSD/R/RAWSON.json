  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 5/2000 revision of the Rawson Series moved the type location to Indiana, at least temporarily. Future updates of the soil surveys in Indiana and Ohio may require it to be moved again. This revision also incorporated the concept of the Royerton Series into the range of the Rawson soils, thus the Royerton Series became inactive. Detailed analysis of the clay contents of the till members in which these soils have been formed indicated the two series could not be consistently separated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (Ap).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 109 cm (10 to 43 inches) (Bt, 2BCt)."
