Rawson soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy sediments and the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.8 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Aurand, Blount and Haskins soils and the moderately well drained Houcktown soils are on less sloping or lower lying landform positions. The very poorly drained Pewamo and Mermill soils are in depressions. The very poorly drained Hoytville soils are on flats and in depressions.

Depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) between January and April in normal years. Potential for surface water runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low or low in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderate in the loamy sediments, moderately slow in the 2B horizons, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 5/2000 revision of the Rawson Series moved the type location to Indiana, at least temporarily. Future updates of the soil surveys in Indiana and Ohio may require it to be moved again. This revision also incorporated the concept of the Royerton Series into the range of the Rawson soils, thus the Royerton Series became inactive. Detailed analysis of the clay contents of the till members in which these soils have been formed indicated the two series could not be consistently separated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (Ap).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 109 cm (10 to 43 inches) (Bt, 2BCt).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data for this pedon is from the Purdue University Lab No. S79IN33-3-(1-7).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
