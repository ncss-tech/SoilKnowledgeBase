The soils formed on cinders, ash, tuff and basalt.  The annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees F. to 68 degrees F.; the January mean is about 41 degrees F., and the July mean about 78 degrees F.  The frost-free season is from 180 to 240 days.  Elevations range from 2,300 to 5,000 feet."

The Lehmans, Cellar, House Mountain, Retriever and Graham soils are all shallow soils with bedrock at 20 inches or less.  Palos Verdes soils are fine-loamy.  Continental soils have an argillic and calcic horizon.  Guest soils are Vertic Torrifluvents with mixed mineralogy."
