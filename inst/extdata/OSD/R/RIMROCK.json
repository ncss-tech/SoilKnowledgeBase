Intersecting slickensides are always present at some depth below 10 inches and above bedrock.\nCalcium carbonate: Masses and hard nodules of secondary carbonates may occur above the basalt, cinders, ash or tuff."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees F. to 68 degrees F.; the January mean is about 41 degrees F., and the July mean about 78 degrees F.  The frost-free season is from 180 to 240 days.

The Lehmans, Cellar, House Mountain, Retriever and Graham soils are all shallow soils with bedrock at 20 inches or less.  Palos Verdes soils are fine-loamy.  Continental soils have an argillic and calcic horizon.  Guest soils are Vertic Torrifluvents with mixed mineralogy."
