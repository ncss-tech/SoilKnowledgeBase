  "STATES": "IL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruark series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy sediments. These soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and depressions on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
