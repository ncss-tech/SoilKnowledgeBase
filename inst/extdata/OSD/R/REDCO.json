  "OVERVIEW": "The Redco series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed from thick clayey sediments. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on low uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches. The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 70 percent. When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches. Cracks remain open from 60 to 90 cumulativee days in most years. Skickensides and wedge-shaped peds begin at a depth of 10 to 24 inches. Undisturbed areas gave gilgai microrelief with microknolls about 4 to 12 inches above the microdepression. Distance from the center of the microkknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from 8 to 15 feet. Colors with chroma of 2 or less in the subsoil are conidered to be lith-chromic. Mottles with chroma of 3 or more, or redox concentrations, are considered to be relic or litho-chromic.\nThe A horizon has colors of brown hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red range from none to common. It ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Bss1 and Bss2 horizons have colors of gray or brown hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4. Mottles range from few to many in shades of brown, yellow, olive, and red. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to modetately acid, but it is very strongly acid throughout more than half of the upper 20 inches.\nThe Bss3 horizon has colors of the upper Bs horizons. Concretions of calcium carbonate range from none to common. The reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Burkeville and Tahoula series in the same family and the similar Lacerda, Naclina, Raylake, and Woodville series. Burkeville soils are calcareous throughout. Lacerda and Raylake soils contain a horizon that is prominently mottled with with red or yellowish red. Burkeville soils are calcareous to the surface and have colors in hue 10YR to 5Y. Tahoula soils are deep to tuffaceous material. Lacerda and Raylake soils are more acid. Woodville soils have a Bt horizon."
