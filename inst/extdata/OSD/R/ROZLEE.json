  "OVERVIEW": "The Rozlee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that are formed in residuum and colluvium derived mostly from limestone, but have some sandstone and quartzite parent rock.  Rozlee soils are on very steep mountain slopes that are usually north facing.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 68 to 72 F. The moisture control section is dry for more than half of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 F. They are moist for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the winter months, but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months.\nThe mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to the Bk horizon is 11 to 23 inches and depth to bedrock (lithic contact) is 20 to 40 inches. Coarse fragments are angular cobbles, gravel, and a few stones derived mostly from limestone, but with some sandstone and quartzite present. Coarse fragments generally increase in amount with depth, and range from 20 to 35 percent in the A horizon, 40 to 70 percent in the Bw horizon, and 50 to 80 percent in the Bk horizon. Most of the coarse fragments are more than 20 mm. in diameter.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline, and slightly to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR and occasionally 7.5YR, value of 5 dry and 3 moist with chroma of 4, or value of 6 dry, and 4 moist with chroma of 2 through 4. It is very cobbly and/or gravelly, silt loam or loam. It is moderately to strongly alkaline, and slightly to strongly calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is very cobbly or gravelly loam or silt loam.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline."

Broad, DeJarnet, Hupp, and Middle soils are noncalcareous in at least the surface 7 inches. DeJarnet soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick. Sandall and Saxby soils lack mollic epipedons."
