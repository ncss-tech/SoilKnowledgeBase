Content of mica flakes typically ranges from none to common. In some pedons, the C horizon below a depth of 40 inches has many flakes of mica. Content of rock fragments commonly is 0 to 12 percent. Some pedons have stones or boulders on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The A horizon is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Brownish, reddish, yellowish, or grayish mottles range from none to common. It commonly is sandy clay loam but includes coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or clay loam. Thin layers of sandy clay are in some pedons.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, gray, or white; or it is mottled in shades of the above. The gray and white mottles in the B horizon are relic weathered rock material and are not due to wetness. The BC horizon is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, gray, or white, or is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, or white.

Buckhead soils have more that 15 percent rock fragments throughout. Cheaha and Rawlings soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Fruithurst, Montonia and Sherless soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Rome, Shady, State, and Wickham soils have a solum thickness of more than 40 inches, formed in alluvium and are on low stream terraces. Sherwood soils have bedrock at depths of 30 to 60 inches. Sugargrove and Tidings soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, and in addition have a Cr horizon of weathered sedimentary rock."
