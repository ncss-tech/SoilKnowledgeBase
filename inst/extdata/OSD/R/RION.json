Content of mica flakes typically ranges from none to common. In some pedons, the C horizon below a depth of 40 inches has many flakes of mica. Content of rock fragments commonly is 0 to 12 percent. Some pedons have stones or boulders on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The A horizon is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.
