  "OVERVIEW": "The Reichel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite with a mixture of volcanic ash in the upper part.  They are on broad ridgetops and mountain slopes at elevations of 2,500 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual  temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Oneonta soils have a solum 10 to 25 inches thick and have less than 18 percent apparent clay in the C horizon.  Soosap soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are dry for part of the summer."
