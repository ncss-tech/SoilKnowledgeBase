Depth to a lithic contact with andesite or breccia is 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section average from 5 to 35 percent and are usually subangular andesite or tuff pebbles.  The soil reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 14 to 26 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Pebbles (2 to 7 mm in diameter) range from 0 to 10 percent.  Organic matter is 10 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is medial loam, medial clay loam or medial silty clay loam.  Andesite pebbles and cobbles average from 5 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly medial loam, very cobbly medial loam or very cobbly medial clay loam.  Pebbles and cobbles average from 35 to 55 percent."

Cultus soils lack a cambic horizon and the upper part of the control section is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Oneonta soils have a solum 10 to 25 inches thick and have less than 18 percent apparent clay in the C horizon.  Soosap soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are dry for part of the summer."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite or andesitic alloclastic breccia with a mixture of volcanic ash in the upper part of the profile.  The average annual air temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 90 inches.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 140 to 160 days."
