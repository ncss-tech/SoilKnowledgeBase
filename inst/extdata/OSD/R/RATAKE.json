  "OVERVIEW": "The Ratake series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in materials weathered from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Ratake soils are on upland hills and ridges and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
