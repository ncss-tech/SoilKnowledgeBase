  "OVERVIEW": "The Reflection series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in gypsiferous alluvium.  Reflection soils are on broad alluvial ridge tops and side slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",

Whether this is a function of vegetative degradation of the gypsic horizon, increased amounts of moisture under bushes, soil erosion factors, etc., is not known.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
