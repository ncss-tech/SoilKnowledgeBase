  "OVERVIEW": "The Rinconflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks. Rinconflat soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes are 3 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
