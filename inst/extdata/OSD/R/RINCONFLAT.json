    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rinconflat soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks. Slopes are 3 to 10 percent. Elevations range from 1,290 to 1,740 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
