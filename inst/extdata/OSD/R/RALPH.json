  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate typically is about 13 to 17 inches and ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  Depth to siltstone, sandstone, or silty shale typically is about 28 to 36 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 11 inches in thickness after mixing and commonly extends into the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam and is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and typically contains between 24 and 28 percent clay, but ranges from 18 to 35 percent and contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.   It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam or loam.  They contain disemminated carbonate and few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The lower Bk horizon contains up to 50 percent by volume of weathered fragments of soft bedrock.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is silty shales, siltstones, or fine-grained sandstones containing free carbonate.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
