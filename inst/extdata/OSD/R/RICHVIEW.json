  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is about 42 to 65 inches in thickness. The loess is 30 to 50 inches in thickness. The control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  Depth to carbonates is greater than 65 inches.  The loamy deposits beneath the loess contain more sand than the overlying loess.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 through 3. It is silt loam and is strongly acid to neutral.  Eroded soils may have silty clay loam Ap horizons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is strongly acid to neutral. It is often incorporated into the Ap horizon in areas that are farmed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Typically the redoximorphic features in the upper part have redder hue or higher chroma, and they grade to yellower hue or lower chroma in the lower part. The texture is dominantly silty clay loam but includes silt loam in some subhorizons. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6 with redoximorphic features that range from red to gray in color. It is silt loam, loam, or clay loam. Sand content is greater than 15 percent.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or, less commonly, silt loam. It is slightly acid or neutral."

Barony, Kaneville, and Windere soils have a soil temperature control section that averages less than 55 degrees F.  Downsouth soils contain less than 7 percent fine sand and coarser in the lower part of the series control section.  Grays, Throckmorton, and Wingate soils have carbonates within a depth of 65 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Richview soils are on knobs and ridges in relatively undissected parts of the loess covered Illinoisan till plain. Slope gradients range from 1 to 15 percent. Richview soils formed in 30 to 50 inches of loess and in the underlying loamy deposits. Richview soils may be underlain, at depths of about 5 to 7 feet, by a strongly developed paleosol. Mean annual temperature varies from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 36 to 45 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cisne, Hickory, and Hoyleton soils. The somewhat poorly drained Hoyleton soils and the poorly drained Cisne soils are in a drainage sequence with Richview soils, and are the most common associates.  The well drained Hickory soils occur on steeper slopes, commonly greater than 15 percent."
