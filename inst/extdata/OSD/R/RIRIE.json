  "OVERVIEW": "The Ririe series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess. Ririe soils are on hills, mountain slopes and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.",
