    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 55 degrees F. The soils are saturated with water throughout the year and subject to freshwater overflow during high tides and spring floods unless diked and artificially drained.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. This horizon has moderate to strong granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has distinct or prominent mottles. This horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 20 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Thin lenses totaling one inch or less of peaty or loamy material with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 are in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 0, 1 or 2. It is composed of stratified material ranging from silty clay loam to sandy loam. Redox concentrations are distinct to prominent with areas having dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) \"pipestems\" up to 1/4 inch in diameter formed in tubular pores and channels. Thin layers of gray (10YR 6/1) ash-like material are in some pedons."
