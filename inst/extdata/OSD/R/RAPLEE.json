  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Raplee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from gypsiferous sandstone and shale.  Raplee soils are on dissected pediments, and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
