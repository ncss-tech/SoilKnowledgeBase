  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section is silt loam, loam, light silty clay loam, or light clay loam with 20 to 34 percent clay and 15 to 25 percent fine or medium sand and with gravel-size shale fragments increasing to as much as 30 percent just above the bedrock.  The soil is weakly to strongly calcareous with increasing quantity of lime with increased depth above the bedrock.  The soil has hue of 7.5YR through 10R.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and average summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F.\nThe Cca horizon has few to common films and threads of lime or few masses of accumulated flour lime.  It contains 8 to 15 percent (estimated) CaC03 equivalent."

Amor and Peritsa soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bynum soils have average summer soil temperature of 52 to 58 degrees F. and have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Darret soils have an argillic horizon.  Duffy, Max, Prospect and Quigley soils have hue of 10YR through 5Y.  Max, Prospect, Quigley, Shambo and Twin Creek soils lack bedrock within depth of 40 inches.  Searing soils are noncalcareous to depths of 10 to 24 inches."

The climate is dry-subhumid with mean annual precipitation of 17 to 19 inches, 80 percent of which falls in April through October.  The annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature ranges from 55 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 110 days."
