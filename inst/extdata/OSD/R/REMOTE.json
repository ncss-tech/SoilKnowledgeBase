  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments average more than 35 percent in the particle-size control section and clay content is 15 to 33 percent. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. It has 5 to 55 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent paragravel. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry. It is clay loam or loam with 15 to 33 percent clay. It has 10 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 25 percent paragravel, and 0 to 10 percent paracobbles. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 7 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam or loam with 15 to 33 percent clay. It has 25 to 55 percent gravel, 2 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 25 percent paragravel, and 0 to 15 percent paracobbles. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cassiday, Chamate, and Trask series. Chamate soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are derived from welded tuffs. Cassiday soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to lithic bedrock contact. Trask soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic bedrock contact. The Chenango, Oquaga, and Tunkhannock series have similar classifications. Chenango soils have a sand and gravel discontinuity at a depth of 24 to 50 inches and are of glacial origin. Oquaga soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic shale bedrock. Tunkhannock soils have rounded rock fragments throughout that are of glacial origin."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Remote soils occur on back slopes, foot slopes, and toeslopes of mountains. These metastable to active landforms are typified by uneven, step-like benches caused by sliding and slumping of bedrock, and reflect ongoing side slope erosional processes on the associated landscapes. Elevations are typically 200 to 1,800 feet, but reach heights of 3,600 feet in the most southern extent of the Coast Range in southwestern Oregon. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone of the Tyee and Flournoy Formations in the Coast Range Mountains and from the Dothan Formation in the Klamath Mountains Province. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is typically 55 to 100 inches, but may range up to 110 inches in the high winter rainfall areas of the interior mountains of southwestern Oregon. The frost-free period is 110 to 220 days."

Bohannon, Etelka, Preacher, and Whobrey soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Etelka and Whobrey soils have fine-textured subsoil horizons with redoximorphic features present. Digger soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Umpcoos soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock."
