The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be less than 47 degrees F., mean summer soil temperature is estimated to be 48 degrees to 50 degrees F., and the difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is estimated to be more than 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 20 inches is usually dry in all parts from mid-June to mid-October and moist in all parts from November to April in most years.  The rock fragment content of the 10 to 40 inch control section is 10 to 35 percent. Base saturation is less than 60 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 7/2; 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/2; 5Y 3/2.  It is loam or silt loam with 20 to 26 percent clay, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and with 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is neutral to medium acid.\nThe B2 horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, 7/4; 5Y 5/3, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6, 8/3.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2, 5/4; 5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 5/6 6/4.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as fine-loamy, micaceous, frigid Dystric Xerochrepts. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nThe base saturation (by Hack Kit), is about 40 percent at a depth of about 70cm.  All horizons contain visible flecks of mica and exhibit a greasy feel characteristic of that mineral.  The micaceous mineralogy is assumed.  Clay does not increase sufficiently to qualify for an argillic horizon.  This series was established to identify and map a new family in a survey area that classified soil map unit components only to the family level.\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 6/81.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
