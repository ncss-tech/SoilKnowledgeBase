  "OVERVIEW": "The Repkie series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from fine and coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges, hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 25 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
