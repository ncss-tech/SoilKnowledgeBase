  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean soil temperature ranges from about 63 to 67 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry more than 3/4 of the time and are not moist for as long as 60 consecutive days.  The soil is very low in organic matter.  The organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing depth.\nSome pedons have weak A1 horizons, other Ap horizons or lack either of these.  The color is about the same throughout the soil.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR, value is 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma ranges from 2 through 4.  A few strata have colors of higher chroma.  The surface layer is sandy loam to silty clay loam.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages loam, clay loam or silty clay loam and contains 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand.  The soil is stratified but lacks contrasting textures within the control section.\nSome pedons have contrasting textures below the control section.  Structure is weak or the horizons are massive.  Usually the soil is calcareous and moderately alkaline throughout except that the upper few inches of some undisturbed pedons are mildly alkaline and noncalcareous.   All parts below depths of 10 to 20 inches are calcareous.  A few small soft to hard concretions or filaments of lime are common, but they are not definitive for the series.  Some pedons contain some salt and alkali but the soil is not typically strongly saline alkali."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Leeds series in the same family and the Anthony, Docas, Gila, Hesperia, Panoche, San Emigidio and Steuber series.  Leeds soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the C horizon.  Anthony, Gila, Hesperia, San Emigdio and Steuber soils have less than 18 percent clay.  Docas soils have less than 15 percent of material coarser than very fine sand.  Panoche soils are not distinctly stratified and have a regular decrease in organic matter."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rosamond soils are in the lower margins of fans, between the sloping fans and the basins and playas at elevations from 2,200 to 2,900 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived mostly from granite and similar rocks.  The climate is arid.  Precipitation is from 3 to 6 inches.  Winters have gentle regional rains and a little snow and summers have very infrequent local thunder showers.  The mean annual temperature is between 61 and 65 degrees F.; the average January temperature is about 44 to 45 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is about 80 to 82 degrees F.  The frost free season is 200 to 260 days."
