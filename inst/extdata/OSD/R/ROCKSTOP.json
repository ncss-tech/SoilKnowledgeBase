  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockstop series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from rhyolite and basalt. Rockstop soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
