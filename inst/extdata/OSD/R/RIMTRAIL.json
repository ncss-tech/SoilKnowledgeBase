Chico soils have oxidized iron masses and iron-manganese masses in the lower Bt horizon.  Corona soils have carbonates in the lower Bt horizon.  Elkhorn soils have iron manganese shot, concretions, or flakes in the Bt horizon and have a C horizon.  Havala series have a C horizon of sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Kawenga soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Lockwood soils are shaly throughout. McCoy soils are 25 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Saltcanyon soils have 20 degrees F. or more difference between mean summer and winter soil temperatures.  Sapwi soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact."
