Elevations range from 300 to 450 meters. These soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free period is about 260 to 280 days."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 35 to 60 centimeters (Bw horizon)\n3. Isotic feature: 15 bar water/clay is 0.6 or more and the NaF pH is greater than 9.4 in all parts of the particle size control section.\n4. Clay content for particle size family determination was calculated due to poor dispersion.\n5. Paralithic materials: The zone from 60 to 160 centimeters (C horizon)\n6. Particle size control section: the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (A2, Bw, and C horizons) averages 21 percent clay in the upper 35 centimeters by weight, and 24 percent rock fragments, by volume; and in the lower 40 centimeters 15 percent clay by weight, and 93 percent rock fragments, by volume.\nADDITIONAL DATA: MASIS User Pedon ID: 05CA601445\nNSSL Pedon No. 05N0656\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
