  "OVERVIEW": "The Rainbear series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone. Rainbear soils are 60 to 160 centimeters deep to paralithic bedrock C material with cracks closer than 10 centimeters apart. Rainbear soils are on mountains and ridges and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",

Cambic horizon - the zone from 35 to 60 centimeters (Bw horizon)\n3. Isotic feature: 15 bar water/clay is 0.6 or more and the NaF pH is greater than 9.4 in all parts of the particle size control section.\n4. Clay content for particle size family determination was calculated due to poor dispersion.\n5. Paralithic materials: The zone from 60 to 160 centimeters (C horizon)\n6. Particle size control section: the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (A2, Bw, and C horizons) averages 21 percent clay in the upper 35 centimeters by weight, and 24 percent rock fragments, by volume; and in the lower 40 centimeters 15 percent clay by weight, and 93 percent rock fragments, by volume."
