  "OVERVIEW": "The Reedpoint series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, escarpments, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
