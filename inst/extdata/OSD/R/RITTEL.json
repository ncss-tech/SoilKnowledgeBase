  "OVERVIEW": "The Rittel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on hills and sides of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
