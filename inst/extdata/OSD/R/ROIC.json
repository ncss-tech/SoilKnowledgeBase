  "OVERVIEW": "The Roic series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffaceous sedimentary rocks. Roic soils are on pediments and hills. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Oceanet soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. and have more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Perlor soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during summer months. Slatery soils have 15 to 20 percent pararock fragments in the particle-size control section and have B horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Somorent soils lack 35 to 60 percent paragravel in the particle-size control section."
