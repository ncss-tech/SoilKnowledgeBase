Celeton soils have 60 to 80 percent pararock fragments of diatomite. Goldyke soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and also have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Oceanet soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. and have more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Perlor soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during summer months. Slatery soils have 15 to 20 percent pararock fragments in the particle-size control section and have B horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Somorent soils lack 35 to 60 percent paragravel in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roic soils are on pediments and hills. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffaceous sedimentary rocks of lacustrine origin. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,830 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."
