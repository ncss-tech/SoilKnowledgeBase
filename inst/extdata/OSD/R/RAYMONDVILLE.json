  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 32 to 50 inches.  When dry, the soil cracks are 3/4 inch to 2 inches wide at the upper end and cracks extend to depths of 30 to 40 inches.  COLE is 0.07 to 0.17.  Salinity in the 10- to 40-inch control section is free to strongly affected.  Depth to a calcic horizon is 25 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon is gray (10YR 5/1), dark gray (10YR 4/1), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  Moist values are less than 3.5 to a depth of at least 10 inches.  In undisturbed areas, the soil is locally weakly cyclic, and within the limits of a pedon the surface soils in microbasins are dark gray (10YR 4/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), and on microknolls they are gray (10YR 5/1) or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  The A horizon is clay loam, clay, or sandy clay.\nThe B horizon is light gray (10YR 7/2), gray (10YR 5/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  It is clay loam or clay with clay content ranging from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe C horizon is light gray (10YR 7/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), very pale brown (10YR 7/3), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  It is clay or clay loam."
