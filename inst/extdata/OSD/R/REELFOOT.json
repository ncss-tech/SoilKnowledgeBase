  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 65 inches.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), dark brown (10YR 3/3), and very dark brown (10YR 2/2).  It is silt loam or loam, and the range includes fine sandy loam and silty clay loam.  The A horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B2t and B3 horizons are yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8) or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) with gray, yellow, olive, or brown mottles.  They are silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content commonly is 25 to 30 percent but ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Content of sand coarser than very fine sand ranges from about 8 to 15 percent, but content of very fine sand is commonly 20 to 35 percent or more.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), gray (10YR 5/1), dark gray (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), or very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mottled with gray, yellow, olive, or brown.  It commonly is silt loam or loam and the range includes silty clay loam and clay loam. Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armistead, Askew, Commerce, Dundee, Forestdale, Mason, Raub, Renox, and Tiptonville series.  Armistead soils have clayey horizons in the 10 to 20 inch section.  Askew and Dundee soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Commerce soils have an ochric epipedon, and they do not have an argillic horizon.  Forestdale soils have an argillic horizon that is dominantly gray, and they do not have a mollic epipedon.  Mason and Tiptonville soils do not have mottles due to wetness within 6 inches of the lower boundary of the mollic epipedon.  Raub soils have C horizons of calcareous glacial till and are mesic.  Renox soils have coarse fragments throughout the solum, and they do not have gray mottles due to wetness within 6 inches of the lower boundary of the mollic epipedon."
