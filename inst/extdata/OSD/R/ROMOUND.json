  "OVERVIEW": "The Romound series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from interbedded shale and gypsum on plains, pediments and structural benches adjacent to canyons.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
