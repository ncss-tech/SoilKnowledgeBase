  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockerjohn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources with a strong influence from granite or other coarse grained igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, mountains and on the valley floor in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
