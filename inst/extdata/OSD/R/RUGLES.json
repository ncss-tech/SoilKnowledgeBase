Some pedons have soft iron-manganese segregations.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have patchy thin clay films in the lower B and C horizons.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent."
