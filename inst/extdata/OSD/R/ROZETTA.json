    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Based upon detailed review of drainage properties, landscapes, soil descriptions, and other data, the series was reclassified to its previous classification as Typic Hapludalfs, rather than Oxyaquic Hapludalfs. These soils are not saturated within a depth of 100 cm for 20 consecutive days or 30 total days in most years.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 inches) (A, E and BE horizons);\nalbic horizon - from a depth of 10 to 28 cm (4 to 11 inches) (E\nhorizon);\nargillic horizon - from a depth of 36 to 127 cm (14 to 50 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Two pedons of Rozetta are published in Soil Survey Investigations Report #19, pp. 177 and 179.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
