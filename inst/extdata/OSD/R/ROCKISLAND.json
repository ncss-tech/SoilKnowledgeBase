  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockisland series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
