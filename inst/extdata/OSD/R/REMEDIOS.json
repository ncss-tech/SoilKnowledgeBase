  "OVERVIEW": "The Remedios series consists of moderately deep, moderately well and well drained soils that formed in colluvium on footslopes and backslopes of hills and valley sides.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches, and mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.",

Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Reaction throughout the profile is extremely or very strongly acid.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture commonly is silt loam, but ranges to include fine sandy loam and loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value moist from 2 through 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 4.  Coarse fragment content in the Bs1 horizon ranges from 5 to 15 percent gravel.
