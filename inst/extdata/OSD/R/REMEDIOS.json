Thickness of the solum ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section has less than 18 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Reaction throughout the profile is extremely or very strongly acid.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture commonly is silt loam, but ranges to include fine sandy loam and loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value moist from 2 through 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 4.  Coarse fragment content in the Bs1 horizon ranges from 5 to 15 percent gravel.  Coarse fragment content in the Bs2 horizon ranges from 35 to 50 percent gravel.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value moist from 3 through 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 6.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 65 percent.  Texture of the C horizons is dominantly silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam or loam."
