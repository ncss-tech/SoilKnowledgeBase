  "OVERVIEW": "The Radnor series consists of\tmoderately deep, poorly drained soils that formed in glacial lake and stream sediments derived from argillite, quartzite and dolomitic limestone from the Belt formation.  These soils are in depressions in old cutoff channels of the Flathead river and in swales, drainage channels and low areas on alluvial fans and terraces. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Radnor soils are on nearly level valley floors where stream channels are not deeply entrenched, and shallow concave drainage swales and closed depressions and elevated terraces that lie below higher land.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent slopes. These soils formed in glacial lake and stream sediments derived from argillite, quartzite and dolomitic limestone from the Belt formation.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 125 days."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Radnor soils are used mainly for forestry, wildlife, and brushy pasture.  Some areas are flooded by beaver dams.  Where cleared and the drainage improved, fair yields of oats, tame grass, and Alsike clover hay are obtained.  Some of the improved pastures support a fair to good sod of bluegrass and white Dutch clover.  Potential native vegetation is mainly conifers, chiefly spruce and certain of the firs, willow, alder, sedge, coarse grasses, and mosses."
