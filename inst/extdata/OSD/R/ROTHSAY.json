  "OVERVIEW": "The Rothsay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty glacial lacustrine sediments or loess on glacial lake plains and moraines.  These soils have moderate permeability and have slopes of 1 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand, and coarser particles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has the lower value or chroma only in the upper part if at all.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nA 2C horizon of loamy glacial till begins at depths as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons."

These soils formed in silty calcareous deposits 4 to 10 feet thick that are of lacustrine or eolian origin.  These sediments are underlain by loamy calcareous glacial till within depths of 60 inches in some pedons.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 38 to 46 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation from about 22 to 27 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1950 feet."

Somewhat excessive drained Zell soils are mapped adjacent to Rothsay on slightly higher terrain or steep slopes.  Moderately well drained Hantho soils are on less sloping terrain and have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Poorly drained Perella soils are on nearly level lower-lying terrain.  Very poorly drained Quam soils are in depressions."
