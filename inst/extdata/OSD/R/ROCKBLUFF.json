  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockbluff series consists of excessively drained soils which are deep or very deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone on valley sides on bedrock controlled uplands.   These soils formed in siliceous sandy colluvium and slope alluvium and in the underlying siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 35 to 55 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Rock fragments are both dolomite and sandstone in the slope alluvium but are just sandstone in the residuum. Volume of channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the soil and from 0 to 35 percent in the lower part.  Volume of flagstones ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the O and A horizons and from strongly acid to neutral throughout the rest of the pedon.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2. The O horizon is a layer of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand. or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand or the channery or flaggy analogs. Horizons with spodic color have pH of 6.0 or more or have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sand, fine sand or the channery or flaggy analogs.  Color is that of the uncoated sand grains in many pedons.\nThe Cr horizon has color like the C horizon described above.  It is soft sandstone and is a paralithic contact but grades to a lithic contact below 60 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was mapped as steep and very steep miscellaneous areas (i.e. steep stony land, etc.) associated with the Jordan sandstone formation in M105.  Typically, these soils are on valley sides below summits and shoulders which are, or were, capped with dolomite bedrock which contributed to the pH and base saturation of the upper parts of the pedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: ochric epipedon - 2 to 9 inches (A, E); siliceous feature - less than 10 percent weatherable minerals (.02 to 2 mm fraction); coated feature - weighted average content of silt plus clay of more than 5 percent in the particle-size control section; paralithic contact - 52 inches (Cr).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0578.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
