Slopes are smooth or undulating and range from 5 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in outwash mainly from granitic rock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 39 degrees F, the average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are 2 to 2 1/2 inches (possibly blacktail volcanic ash - Mt. St. Helens 'T') and a cambic horizon from 2 1/2 to 30 inches.  The upper 12 inches of the mineral soil is estimated to have a moist bulk density of less than 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The solum from 14 to 30 inches is estimated to have volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent.  Family particle-size is coarse-loamy, the calculated weighted average of sand is 47 to 67 percent, silt is 33 to 53 percent and clay is 0 to 2 percent.  This 3/97 description reflects a change in classification due to Andisol Order from Medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, Andic Cryochrepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, Andic Cryochrepts.  Classification changed 1/00 from mixed Andic Cryochrepts to isotic Andic Eutrocryepts based on revision to Soil Taxonomy.\nFurther investigation is needed as to whether the E horizon is really a C or A horizon from ash and as to the possibility of a udic soil moisture regime based on the vegetation present and andic influence.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the to of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
