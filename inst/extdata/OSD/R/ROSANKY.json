  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches and depth to a paralithic contact of sandstone ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The sandstone is weakly or strongly consolidated.  The argillic horizon has 0 to about 5 percent by volume of sandstone or ironstone fragments or thin discontinuous layers.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, red, and yellow are considered to be lithochromic.\nThe A and E horizons are loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly or very gravelly counterparts.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR to lOYR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to lOYR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction of the A and E horizons ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, unless limed.  The epipedon has sandstone and ironstone pebbles that comprise 0 to 50 percent by volume.  Siliceous pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent in some pedons.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have colors in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles in shades of brown, red or yellow range from none to few.  Texture is sandy clay or clay averaging 35 to 50 percent clay in the control section, with the clay content decreasing 20 to 50 percent of the maximum within a depth of 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BCt and C horizons have colors in shades of red, yellow or brown with hue of 2.5YR to lOYR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow or gray range from none to a mottled matrix.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly or strongly consolidated sandstone. Colors are typically in shades of brown, red or gray.  It is typically fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam, and is extremely hard when dry.  Some pedons have discontinuous ironstone strata or fragments.  Clay films are along fractures in pedons.  Reaction is commonly strongly acid or moderately acid."

All these soils except Gause, Spiller and Travis soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Gause soils have Bt horizons with hue of 7.5YR or lOYR.  Spiller soils have colors in hue of lOYR in the upper argillic.  Travis soils are underlain with ancient gravelly alluvium at depths of 50 to 70 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rosanky soils are on convex gently sloping to moderately sloping ridgetops.  The soil formed in weakly consolidated sandstone or packsand with or without loamy or clayey strata, mainly of the Weches and Reklaw Formations , and a sandstone member of the Cook Mountain Formation.  Slope gradients are 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 240 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 250 to 650 feet.  Annual P-E index ranges from 44 to 66."

Margie soils have base saturation greater than 75 percent in the argillic horizon.  Gasil have fine-loamy control sections.  Stidham soils have arenic surface layers.  Jedd soils are on greater slopes but in similar landscapes. Margie soils are on similar positions.  Gasil and Stidham soils are on lower positions and on smoother topography."
