  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rumple series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone.  These gently to moderately sloping soils occur on backslopes of low hills on dissected plateaus.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (degrees 65 F).",
