  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 6 to 9 inches and corresponds to the thickness of the Ap or A horizon.  Rodney soils are typically calcareous throughout, however some pedons are leached to a depth of 10 inches.  The upper silty clay material extends to a depth of about 9 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay with a clay content range from 40 to 60 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The C horizon is typically silt loam.  It is less commonly loam.  Thin strata of sandy loam or loamy sand are within the range.  Clay content ranges from 14 to 26 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Ab horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The 2Ab horizon is silty clay or clay and ranges from 40 to 65 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bg horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are silty clay or clay with a clay content of 40 to 60 percent clay.  The 3Cg horizon or strata with silt loam, sandy loam or clay loam textures below 40 inches are within the range for the series.  They are moderately alkaline."

Blue Earth soils formed in coprogenous earth and have 10 to 30 percent organic matter in the upper 2/3 of the series control section.  Moundprairie soils have less than 40 percent clay throughout the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rodney soils are on nearly level flood plains of the Missouri River.  Slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in recently deposited clayey and loamy alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 24 to 30 inches.  Annual frost free days range from 140 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet above mean sea level."

Lossing soils are in similar landscape positions and are silt loam in the 10 to 40 inch control section and are somewhat poorly drained.  Onawa soils have silty clay textures 18 to 30 inches deep and are somewhat poorly drained.  Owego soils have silty clay texture 12 to 24 inches deep."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most Rodney soils are cultivated.  Some Rodney soils are also irrigated.  Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. The native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Prairie Cordgrasses, Big Bluestems, Switchgrasses, Grays Sedges, Fox Sedges, Tall Tickseeds, and Great St. John Worts."
