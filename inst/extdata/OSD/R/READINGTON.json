  "OVERVIEW": "The Readington series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in medium textured residuum weathered from noncalcareous shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 15 slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow. Mean annual precipitation is 43 inches. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of angular shale, siltstone, sandstone, and in some pedons quartzite gravel, range from 0 to 20 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 5 to 50 percent in the lower part of the solum and C horizon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid in the upper part of the solum where unlimed, and from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Brownish or grayish redox features generally are in the B horizons below a depth of about 17 inches. Redox features with chromas of two or less do not occur in the top 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Texture ranges from loam through silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture ranges from loam through silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a C horizon. It has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Fine earth texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam."

Lawrenceville soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section and do not have hue of 5YR or redder in the B horizon. Stainsburg soils have coarse loamy texture and bedrock within 40 inches. Klinesville soils have bedrock within 20 inches and Reaville soils have bedrock within 40 inches."
