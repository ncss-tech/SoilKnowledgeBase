  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 35 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 90 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Rock fragments of angular shale, siltstone, sandstone, and in some pedons quartzite gravel, range from 0 to 20 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 5 to 50 percent in the lower part of the solum and C horizon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid in the upper part of the solum where unlimed, and from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Brownish or grayish redox features generally are in the B horizons below a depth of about 17 inches. Redox features with chromas of two or less do not occur in the top 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Texture ranges from loam through silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture ranges from loam through silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a C horizon. It has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Fine earth texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam."

Bartley, Comly, Jonca, and Wooster soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the B horizon. Gatton soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the solum. Hustontown soils are on colluvial fans and U- shape drainageways and headslopes."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Readington soils are on concave, nearly level to sloping lower hillsides, upland flats, drainage ways, and stream heads. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in medium textured residuum largely from reddish noncalcareous shale, siltstone, and fine grained sandstone. The climate in humid temperature; mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., and the freeze-free season ranges from 170 to 200 days."

Abbottstown, Croton, and Doylestown soils have dominant chroma of two or less in the argillic horizon. Athol, Bucks, Lansdale, Lewisberry, and Penn soils do not have mottles and fragipans and Penn soils also have bedrock within 40 inches. The Chalfont soils have mottles of two chroma or less in the top ten inches of the Bt. Lawrenceville soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section and do not have hue of 5YR or redder in the B horizon. Stainsburg soils have coarse loamy texture and bedrock within 40 inches. Klinesville soils have bedrock within 20 inches and Reaville soils have bedrock within 40 inches."
