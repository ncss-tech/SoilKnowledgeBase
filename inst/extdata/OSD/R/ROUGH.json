    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 0 to 8 inches. Depth to bedrock is less than 10 inches and typically ranges from 4 to 9 inches. Rock fragments of shale, siltstone, or fine-grained sandstone channers range from 15 to 60 percent in the A horizon, 35 to 75 in the Bw horizon, and 45 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe R horizon consists of moderately hard or hard shales, siltstones, or fine-grained sandstones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rough soils formed in residuum from shales, siltstones, and fine-grained sandstones in the Millboro, Brallier, and Chemung formations and are on dissected uplands. Slope gradients range from 7 to 100 percent but are dominantly 55 to 90 percent. Small areas of rock outcrop are common, especially on steep and very steep backslopes. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, frost free days range from 145 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 900 to 3600 feet or to the mesic-frigid boundary."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Berks, Ernest, Escatawba, Gilpin, Macove, Shelocta, and Weikert soils. All these soils are deeper to bedrock than Rough soils. Ernest soils have a fragipan. Escatawba soils have a clayey fine-earth fraction in the subsoil. Gilpin and Shelocta soils are not skeletal. Berks, Gilpin, and Weikert soils are on similar landscape positions. Ernest, Escatawba, Macove, and Shelocta soils are on lower fans, backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now within the range of the Rough series were previously mapped as Weikert.\nFeatures and diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon, the zone from 0 to 1 inch.\n2. Zone from 1 to 5 inches, called the Bw, does not meet criteria for a Cambic horizon.\n3. Lithic contact at 7 inches.\n4. Reaction less than 5.0 throughout.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The ranges for morphological properties are based on profile descriptions of 58 randomly located pedons in Bath and Alleghany Counties, Virginia, and lab data from one non-TP pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
