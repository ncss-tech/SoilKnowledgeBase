The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils have a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, and an estimated phosphate retention of more than 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 0.4 percent, and volcanic glass of more than 60 percent in the ashy overlay.  Thickness of the ashy materials and depth to contrasting materials range from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam with 5 to 25 percent gravel size cinders.\nThe 2AB horizon, when present has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam with 10 to 20 percent clay and has 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It is cobbly loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 25 percent are gravel and 0 to 20 percent are cobbles."
