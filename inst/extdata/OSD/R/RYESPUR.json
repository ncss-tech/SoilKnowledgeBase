The Woodcock typical pedon is moved to a cryic area.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n*Organic soil material--zone 0 to 1 cm (Oi horizon)\n*Mollic epipedon--zone from 1 to 44 cm (A1, A2, and BA horizons)\n*Vitrandic intergrade feature--zone from 1 to 44 cm (A1, A2, and BA horizons)\n*Argillic horizon--zone from 44 to 123 cm (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)\n*Lithologic discontinuity--44 cm\n*Particle-size control section--zone from 44 to 94 cm (2Bt1 horizon and part of the 2Bt2 horizon)"
