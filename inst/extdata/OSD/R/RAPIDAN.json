Buffstat, Casville, Christian, Clifton, Clover, Danripple, Flagspring, Goresville, Groseclose, Howell, Mount Rush, Muse, Sequoia, Spears Mountain, Totier, Unison, Warminster and Yellowbottom are competing series. Mount Rush, Sequoia, and Spears Mountain have lithic or paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Mount Rush soils developed in residuum of mixed felsic and mafic metamorphic and igneous rock. Sequoia developed in residuum of red shale and siltstone. Spears Mountain soils developed in residuum of schist, phyllite and other fine-grained rock. Boden, Buffstat, Christian, Howell, Muse, Totier and Warminster have lithic or paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches. Boden soils developed in residuum of sandstone and shale in the Ozark Highlands. Buffstat soils developed in residuum of sericite schist, graphitic schist or phyllite. Christian soil developed in residuum of interbedded limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Howell soils developed in unconsolidated sediments containing diatomaceous earth or glauconite. Muse soils developed in colluvium of shale and siltstone. Totier and Warminster soils developed in red Triassic shale. Danripple soils are moderately well drained and developed in alluvium on high stream terraces. Braddock soils developed in colluvium and alluvium of crystalline rock. Casville soils developed in residuum of felsic or intermediate igneous or metamorphic rock. Clifton soils developed in residuum of intermediate and mafic rock. Clover soils developed in residuum of Triassic materials. Flagspring soils developed in colluvium of cherty limestone over residuum of limestone and Tripoli. Goresville soils developed in alluvium on high stream terraces. Groseclose soils developed in residuum of limestone, shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Unison soils developed in colluvium and alluvium of mixed acidic and basic crystalline rock. Yellowbottom soils developed in residuum of sericite schist, phyllonite or metamonzagranite."

    "content": "REMARKS: 6/2004--Rapidan type location moved to Culpeper County, Virginia due to age of original description and errors within description. Classification was changed from Clayey, mixed, mesic, Typic Rhodudults because it is thought that rhodic colors are on the fringe rather than the central concept of this series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\n2) Argillic horizon - from 8 to 80 inches (Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
