  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Riceville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 35 to 75 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying till.  These soils are on convex side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters.",
