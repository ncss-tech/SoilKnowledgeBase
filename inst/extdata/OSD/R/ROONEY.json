Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume and are dominantly 1/8 to 3 inches in diameter including 3 to 10 inch diameter fragments.  The fine earth fraction of the control section ranges from 8 to 27 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Horizons with moist values of 3 are less than 4 inches thick.  It has very cobbly and extremely cobbly modifiers of the fine earth fraction.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, 4 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly loam.\nSome pedons have C horizons with colors and textures like the AC horizon.  They range in thickness from 0 to 15 inches."
