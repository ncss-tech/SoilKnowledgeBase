The series was separated based on differences in particle size class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in)  (Bw, Bss horizon)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in).  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 10 to 130 cm (4 to 51 in).  (Bw, Bss, Bssy horizons)\nDensic contact: The contact with Cdy at 130 cm (51 in).  (Cy horizon)\nVertic features: The presence of slickensides at 28 to 130 cm (11 to 51 in).  (Bss, Bssy horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU Data from S80TX-005-012.  Particle-size analysis tests were performed at the project office on one pedon.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 10th Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
