  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 48 inches (Bw horizons).\nThis soil was formerly included with the Dickinson, Ocheyedan, and Waukegan soils.\nThis soil appears to be a common component of \"sand stringers\" found along glacial margins. Further studies are needed to determine their extent, as well as the source of the gray silts that occur immediately above the glacial till and below the eolian sand deposits.\nADDITIONAL DATA: For results of some laboratory analysis refer to Iowa Agriculture Experiment Station file number 95IA041021 for data on the typical pedon, and to Lincoln Laboratory for data on additional pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
