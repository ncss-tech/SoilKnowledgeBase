  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic carbon content ranges from 1 to 2 percent in the A horizon and from .5 to 1.5 percent in the C horizon and decreases irregularly with depth.  Depth to effervescent horizons is 0 to 10 inches.  Exchangeable sodium is typically less than 5 percent but ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 4 millimhos per centimeter.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Textures are variable.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are variable throughout this horizon but average loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  It has 1 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent which may vary considerably between strata.  Electrical conductivity is commonly 0 to 4 millimhos per centimeter, but may range to 12 millimhos in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."

Deekay and Oldwolf soils have argillic horizons.  Iwait soils have a regular decrease in organic matter and have horizons of uniform textures below the A horizon.  Fairburn soils are shallow.  Ucross soils are moderately deep.\nThe Boruff soils occur in similar positions.  The Deekay, Iwait, Oldwolf, Fairburn and Ucross soils occur on uplands."
