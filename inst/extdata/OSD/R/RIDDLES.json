Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Riddles soils formed in loamy and sandy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barry, Brookston, Crosier, Hillsdale, Metea, Miami, Oshtemo, Rensselaer, and Williamstown soils. The Riddles soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Williamstown soils, the somewhat poorly drained Crosier soils, the poorly drained Barry and Brookston soils, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Rensselaer soils on lower landform positions. The well drained Hillsdale, Metea, and Oshtemo soils and the moderately well drained Miami soils are also closely associated on similar landform positions. Hillsdale and Oshtemo soils do not have as much clay in the argillic horizon. Metea soils have 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of sand or loamy sand in the surface layer. Miami soils have carbonates at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches)."
