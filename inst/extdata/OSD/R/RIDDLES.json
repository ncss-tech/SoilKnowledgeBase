Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

The Riddles soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Williamstown soils, the somewhat poorly drained Crosier soils, the poorly drained Barry and Brookston soils, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Rensselaer soils on lower landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Blount, Capac, Locke, Sleeth, and Teasdale soils also occur on lower landform positions. The well drained Arkport, Hillsdale, Metea, Okee, Oshtemo, and Spinks soils, and the moderately well drained Miami soils are also closely associated on similar landform positions. Arkport, Hillsdale, Oshtemo, and Spinks soils do not have as much clay in the argillic horizon. Metea soils have 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of sand or loamy sand in the surface layer."
