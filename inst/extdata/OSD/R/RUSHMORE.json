  "REVDATE": "05/2006",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rushmore series consists of very deep poorly drained soils that formed in 24 to 40 inches of loess or silty lacustrine sediments over calcareous firm glacial till on ground moraines. These soils have moderately slow permeability. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to carbonates range from 15 to 36 inches. The thickness of the loess or silty glacial lacustrine sediments over the glacial till is 24 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 24 inches in thickness. Coarse fragments are essentially absent in the loess and comprise 2 to 8 percent by volume of the glacial till. A stone line ranging to as much as 4 inches in thickness and containing up to 20 percent by volume of coarse fragments commonly is at the contact of the glacial till. The coarse fragments are mixed in lithology. The particle-size control section averages between 24 and 36 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. The upper mantle averages between 27 and 38 percent clay with the higher contents in the upper part, and averages between 4 and 12 percent sand. The glacial till averages between 24 and 32 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3 with chroma of 3 or 4 is in the lower part in some pedons. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe 2Bk horizon is similar to the 2BC horizon but has evidence of secondary carbonates and a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 25 percent.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. It is firm. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 20 percent. The moist bulk density is 1.6 to 1.8 g/cc."

Drummer soils have thicker sola. Elvira soils have concentration of iron and manganese oxides in the A and B horizons. Garwin, Hartsburg, Leshara, Madelia, Marcus, Ossian, Patton, Sable, and Wacousta soils have silt loam or silty clay loam B and C horizons extending to depths below 40 inches. In addition, all of these soils except Leshara, Madelia, and Marcus are in areas receiving more precipitation. Maxcreek soils have more sand in the lower part of the B horizon and in the 2C horizon. Maxfield soils have thicker sola and are in areas receiving more precipitation. Pella soils are in areas receiving more precipitation and in addition, have loamy 2C horizons formed in outwash or till. Letri soils contain more sand in the solum. Ransom soils are better drained and have browner B horizons."
