  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 F.  The solum ranges from 12 to 24 inches thick.  Clay content of the texture control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Depth to a continuous horizon of visible calcareous material ranges from 12 to 22 inches.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent by volume in the particle-size control section and are dominately channers and angular cobbles.  The soil is dry in some part of the moisture control section for 90 to 120 cumulative days that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is more than 41 degrees F., and the soil is dry for 15 to 20 consecutive days during May and June.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically loam modified with channers but also includes sandy loam.  This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or light clay loam and is modified with channery coarse fragments.  This horizon is neutral through moderately alkaline.  In some pedons the lower portion of the Bw horizon is only slightly calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from approximately 3 to 12 percent."

Arle soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Bigsheep soils have a calcic horizon and have hue of 10YR or yellower.  Dolus soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Frenchcreek soils do not have a Bk horizon and lack carbonates throughout.  Sixbeacon soils have a calic horizon from 12 to 60 inches.  Towave soils have hue of 10YR or yellower throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redthayne soils are on mountain side slopes, toe slopes and alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 3 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale, and from crystalline rocks.  Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 7,000 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 16 inches."
