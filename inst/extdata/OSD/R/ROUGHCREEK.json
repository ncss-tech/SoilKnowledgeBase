  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Roughcreek series consists of soils that are shallow to indurated limestone bedrock of Ordovician age. These well drained soils formed in residuum derived from weathering of dolomitic limestone. These gently sloping to steep soils are on summits, shoulders, and back slopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly rangeland and wildlife habitat. The climax plant community is a tall grass savannah with motts of live oak throughout the landscape. The dominant grasses are little bluestem and sideoats grama. Other grasses include yellow Indiangrass, fall witchgrass, wildrye, green sprangletop, meadow dropseed, cane and pinhole bluestem, hairy grama, Texas wintergrass, curly mesquite and buffalograss. Woody plants include live oak, shin oak, evergreen sumac, hackberry, elbowbush, redbud, and white honeysuckle. Forbs, such as orange zexmenia, Engelmann daisy, bundleflower, snout bean, and bushsunflower, are present. The site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population sideoats grama, buffalograss, hairy grama, dropseeds, and the woody plants. If this destructive grazing practice continues, the site will deteriorate to a plant population of Ashe juniper, Texas persimmon, live oak, Texas grama, hairy tridens, curly mesquite, threeawns, prairie coneflower, and broomweed."
