Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.   Texture is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Thin threads of calcium carbonate occur in most pedons and calcium carbonate concretions and dark stains occur in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6 and has thin strata ranging from loamy fine sand through silty clay loam.\nIn some pedons an Ab horizon occurs below a depth of 24 inches. It has colors like the A horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redport soils are on nearly level flood plains, mainly on streams that carry sediments of the Permian red beds, and some tributaries of the Pennsylvanian.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They are occasionally flooded for very brief or brief periods during March through August.  The soil formed in reddish loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 52 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 80.  Frost free days range from 200 to 220."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Latanier, Okay, Oklared, Pledger, Redlake, Roebuck, Severn, and Ships series. Latanier, Redlake, and Ships soils are on the same terrace in slightly lower positions on the landscape farther from the main stream.  Latanier, Pledger, Redlake, Roebuck, and Ships soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Pledger and Roebuck soils are usually on the same terrace but on a lower landscape in back slough or concave positions.  Also, Redlake soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Okay soils have an argillic horizon and are on high terraces above overflow.  Oklared and Severn soils are on lower terraces and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section."
