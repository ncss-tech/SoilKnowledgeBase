  "OVERVIEW": "The Rowena series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on terraces on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
