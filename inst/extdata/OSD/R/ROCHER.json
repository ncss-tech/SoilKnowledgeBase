  "OVERVIEW": "The Rocher series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous stratified alluvium on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development is 6 to 20 inches and corresponds to the thickness of the A horizon or the A and AC horizons.  Carbonates are at a depth of 10 inches or less.  Some pedons do not have carbonates in some strata at depths between 20 and 60 inches.  These soils typically are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout, but some pedons are neutral in the Ap or A horizon, or in some layers of the C horizon below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap or A) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, loam, or silt loam.  Clay content is 5 to 18 percent.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon.  It is within the same ranges defined for the Ap or A horizon.\nThe lower part of the series control section (C) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons contain redoximorphic features have chroma higher than the matrix.  The C horizon commonly is very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand, and contains strata of loamy fine sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam within a depth of 60 inches.  Clay content is 5 to 18 percent in the upper part and 2 to 15 percent in the lower part."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

Carr soils are dominated by fine sand in the series control section and occur in areas with less than 35 inches of annual precipitation.  Stonelick soils are dominated in the series control section with sand coarser than fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rocher soils are on natural levees and flood-plain splays on nearly level or gently undulating flood plains.  They formed in loamy or sandy stratified calcareous alluvium that is dominated by very fine sand.  Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent.  These soils typically are subject to frequent flooding, but some areas are occasional or rare because of levees, locks and dams, or other flood-control structures.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 210 days, and elevation is 340 to 450 feet above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blake, Fults, Haynie, and Sarpy soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Blake and poorly drained Fults soils contain more clay in the control section and occur in lower-lying areas of the flood plain.  The moderately well drained Haynie soils are coarse-silty and occur on similar but slightly lower landform positions.  The excessively drained Sarpy soils are sandy and occur on similar but slightly higher landform positions."
