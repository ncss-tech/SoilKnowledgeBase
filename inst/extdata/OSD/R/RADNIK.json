Cameo soils have hue of 10YR or yellower. Castledale soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Charalito soils average 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have hue 10YR or yellower. Clarkelen, Glenberg, Kornman, and Redbank soils are moist in the soil moisture control section in the spring and early summer and attempt to reflect the effects of soil forming agents unique to the Great Plains. The use of the Redbank series in MLRA 35 should be discontinued. Colorow soils have hue 10YR and yellower and redoximorphic features in the lower part of the control section due to a fluctuating water table. Innacut soils contain a significant amount of volcanic glass and mica from miceous sandstone. Tapicito soils have 7.5YR or 10YR hues through out the soil profile."
