  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockbottom series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed in lacustrine deposits underlain by loamy- skeletal glacial till on lake plains and the margins of lake plains and moraines.  Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and moderate in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of stones ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 5 percent throughout the rest of the soil.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the A, A/B and Bt horizons and from 20 to 40 percent in the 2Bt and 3C horizons.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the upper finer textured layers and from 15 to 50 percent in the lower coarser-textured materials.  Stony and very stony surface phases are recognized.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the upper finer textured materials and from slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the coarser textured lower materials.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is stony silt loam,stony loam or stony fine sandy loam.  The A part of the A/B horizon has colors and textures similar to the A horizon.  The B part of the A/B has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  The 2Bt has colors similar to the Bt horizon.  It is the very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues of sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  They are very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues of fine sandy loam or sandy loam."

The Abreu, Grizzly, Macmeal, Mocmont, Pactola, Rockoa, Rumblecreek, Tecolote, Trapps, Vanocker, Wahatoya and Yourame series are substantially drier in the soil moisture control section for the 120 days following the summer solstice.  The Krakow soils have thinner and less acid sola and have rock fragments dominated by flagstones and channers.  Posen soils do not have an argillic horizon."
