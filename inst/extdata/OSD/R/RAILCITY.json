  "OVERVIEW": "The Railcity series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Railcity soils are on landslides.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
