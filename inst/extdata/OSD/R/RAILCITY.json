Elevations range from 1,535 to 2,135 meters.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

The vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of Jeffrey pine or ponderosa pine with an understory of pointleaf manzanita, antelope bitterbrush, and some mountain big sagebrush.  Red fir occurs at the upper elevations on north-facing slopes."
