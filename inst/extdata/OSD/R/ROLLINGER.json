  "OVERVIEW": "The Rollinger series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash at the surface and slope alluvium on north-facing hillslopes and piedmont slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
