    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 100 to 120 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is more than 40 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates range from 28 to 42 inches.  The upper 7 to 11 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 30 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and averages less than 15 percent rock fragments by volume.\nThe Ap horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. It has strong or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 3Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is weak or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky and may contain up to 15 percent rock fragments.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe 3Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rollinger soils are on north-facing hillslopes and piedmont slopes and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in loess and some slope alluvium.  Elevations are 1,500 to 2,900 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 25 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is about 48 to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."
