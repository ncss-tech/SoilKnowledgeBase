Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 1 to 8 percent by volume.\nThe O horizon is partially to well decomposed organic matter from remains of trees, shrubs, sedges, and forest floor flora.  It has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 1 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.

Somewhat poorly drained Kooch soils are on slightly convex to plane surfaces on higher lying positions.  Moderately well drained Haystore soils are on convex higher lying positions"
