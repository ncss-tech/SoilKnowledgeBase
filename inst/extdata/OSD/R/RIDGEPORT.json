  "REVDATE": "03/2007",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ridgeport series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of moderately coarse textured alluvium and the underlying calcareous sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on nearly level to convex slopes on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.",
