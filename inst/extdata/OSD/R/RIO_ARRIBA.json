    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is more than 60 inches.  Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon is 60 percent or more.  The A horizon has colors in hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of more than 3 and chromas of 3 or 4.  The B horizon has colors in hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 through 6 and chromas of 4 through 8.  Cracks occur at 20 inches and COLE values of 0.09 or more for more than 20 inches of B horizon.  Fine clay content is higher in the B horizon than the A.  The structure of the B horizon ranges from weak to moderate. Depth to the horizon with red mottles ranges from 20 to 42 inches.  The soil ranges from medium acid through mildly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fajardo, Juncal, Machete, San Sebastian, and Tanama series, all of which lack the .09 COLE value common to the VERTIC subgroups.  The Fajardo soils are more acid, have gray mottles in the lower part.  The Juncal soils have free carbonates in the lower profile. The San Sebastian soils have more than 50 percent limestone rock fragments in the profile.  The Tanama soils have hard limestone rock within 20 inches of the surface."

The soil formed in fine textured sediments of mixed origin.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 65 inches and the mean temperature is 77 degrees F."
