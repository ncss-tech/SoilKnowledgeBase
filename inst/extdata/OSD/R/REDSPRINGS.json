  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clayham series in the same family, and the Cowton, Cuthbert, Kirvin, Meth, Nacogdoches, Rosanky, and Trawick series in closely related families. Clayham soils are not formed from weathered glauconitic material, and do not have iron and glauconitic gravel. Cowton and Meth soils have mixed mineralogy. In addition, Cowton soils have a paralithic contact of shale at a depth 20 to 40 inches, and Meth soils have a solum 60 to 80 inches thick. Cuthbert and Kirvin soils have base saturation less than 35 percent and mixed mineralogy. In addition, Cuthbert soils have a solum 20 to 40 inches thick. Rosanky soils have mixed mineralogy and are dry for longer periods. Nacogdoches soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick and color value less than 4 throughout the Bt horizon. Trawick soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches and base saturation more than 60 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redsprings soils are on gently sloping to steep Western Coastal Plains uplands in geologic formations rich in glauconite, mainly the Reklaw and Weches formations of the Claiborne Group of the Tertiary System. Slopes are slightly convex, and tend to be complex on the steeper gradients. Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 15 percent, but range from 2 to 40 percent. Climate is warm and humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches, with frost-free rainfall of 25 to 30 inches. The summer moisture deficit is 4 to 6 inches. Frost free days range from 240 to 260 and elevation is 300 to 500 feet above sea level. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F., and Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 84."

Briley, Darco, Lilbert, Pickton, and Wolfpen soils are above on higher positions with smoother slopes. The have arenic and gross- arenic surface layers and loamy control sections. Cuthbert soils are on similar positions. Elrose soils are on smoother lower slopes, have fine-loamy control sections, and sola thicker than 60 inches. Kirvin soils are on nearby slightly lower convex ridges. Tenaha soils are on similar positions and have an arenic surface layer, and base saturation less than 35 percent."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Redsprings soils are used predominantly for woodland and pasture. Forests consists mainly of red oak, post oak, hickory, loblolly and shortleaf pine trees with an understory of American beauty berry, greenbriar, native forbs and grasses. Pasture grasses are mainly improved species of bermudagrass and bahiagrass."
