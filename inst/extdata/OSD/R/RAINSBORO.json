  "OVERVIEW": "The Rainsboro series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed\nin loess and the underlying weathered Illinoian outwash deposits on high\nterraces.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the loess, moderately\nslow or slow in the fragipan, and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying\nmaterial.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is\nabout 39 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
