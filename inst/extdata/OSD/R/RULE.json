  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thin A1 horizons occur in some pedons. The soils are noncalcareous throughout except that very thin and discontinuous subhorizons immediately above the bedrock are weakly calcareous in a few pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon.  These are mainly 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter.  A majority of subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 5YR or redder.  Within the sand fraction the content of medium and coarse angular sand having a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains ranges from 15 to about 90 percent and horizons of low organic matter content have a differential between dry and moist conditions that is 1 to 3 times greater than that of similar soils having finer and more rounded sand grains.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  The B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically gravelly coarse sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 35 percent, and sand from 40 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand much of which is medium and coarse sandy.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon if present has hue of 5YR through 10R.  It is typically coarser than the B2t horizon and usually is coarse sandy loam but clay ranges from 5 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 47 to 82 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand, much of which is medium and coarse sand.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

Allens Park, Bayerton, and Fairport soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Bradford, Haugan, Kruse, Nunica, Omena, Plome, Underhill, and Warba soils lack paralithic contacts at depths of less than 40 inches.  Bradford, Gateson, Greenough, Haugan, Kruse, Nebish, Nunica, Omena, and Warba soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in a majority of subhorizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rule soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 40 percent or more.  The soils formed in moderately thin noncalcareous moderately coarse to moderately fine materials weathered residually or locally transported from reddish brown arkose beds.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 62 degrees F."
