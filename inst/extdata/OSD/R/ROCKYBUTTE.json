  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rockybutte soils are on lower sideslopes of structural fans and terraces and board summits of ridges and plateaus.  They formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over weathered porcelanite or very channery slopewash derived from porcelanite.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations ranges from 3,800 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."

In addition, Moorhead soils are fine.  Ironbutte soils are on narrow summits and ridges. They do not have argillic horizons and are shallow to fragmental material consisting of porcelanite.  Muleherder soils are on sideslopes.  They do not have argillic horizons."
