  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockybutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over weathered porcelanite.  Rockybutte soils are on structual fans, terraces, broad ridges and plateaus.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
