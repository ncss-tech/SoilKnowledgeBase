  "OVERVIEW": "The Rambla series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks. Rambla soils occur on basin rims and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 6 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is more than 60 inches deep and is strongly stratified. The organic matter is less than 1 percent at the surface and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. The soil is typically nonsaline-nonalkali at the surface and saline-alkali below a depth of 19 inches. The soil is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent. The lime is disseminated in soft masses. Mean annual soil temperature is 64 degrees to 67 degrees F. This soil would have an aquic moisture regime but is now artificially drained. Depth to the IIC horizon is 19 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/2; or 2.5Y 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/2; or 2.5Y 4/4. In some pedons the surface horizon has value of 3 moist, but it is less than 2 inches thick. The A horizon has strong fine or medium granular, strong coarse or very coarse prismatic, or moderate or strong medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 6/1 or 7/1; 10YR 7/2 or 8/3 and moist color of 5Y 4/1, 5/1, 5/2; 10YR 6/2 or 7/3. There are few to many fine or medium, distinct or prominent mottles that have color of 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; or 10YR 4/4. This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C1 horizon is loamy sand or sandy loam and averages 2 to 10 percent clay. In the upper part of the C horizon moist chroma is 1 or less and if there are mottles the moist chroma is 1 or 2."
