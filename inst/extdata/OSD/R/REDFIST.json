  "OVERVIEW": "The Redfist series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from red shale bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, knolls and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
