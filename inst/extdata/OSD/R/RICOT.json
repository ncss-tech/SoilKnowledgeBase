  "OVERVIEW": "The Ricot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material over outwash derived from mixed sources.  Ricot soils are on hills, mountains, and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
