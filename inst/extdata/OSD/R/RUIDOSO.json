The soils formed in materials derived mostly from sedimentary and igneous rocks. The climate is semiarid continental. At the type location, the average annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches (307 to 410 mm) with a pronounced summer maximum. The average annual temperature is about 54 to 56 degrees F (12 to 13.6 degrees C). The frost free season is 150 to 180 days."
