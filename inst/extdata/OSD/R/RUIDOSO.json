  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruidoso series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks on alluvial fans and valley sides. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches (358 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F (13 degrees C).",
