  "OVERVIEW": "The Raelakes series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium and till over residuum weathered from granitic rocks. The Raelakes soils are on structural benches of mountain slopes and cirques of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
