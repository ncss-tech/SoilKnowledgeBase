  "OVERVIEW": "The Roundval series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Roundval soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
