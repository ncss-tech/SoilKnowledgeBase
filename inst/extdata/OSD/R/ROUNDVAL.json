Elevations are 1,345 to 1,435 meters.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters with some snowfall.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The frost-free season is 140 to 1600 days."

The Conway soils are coarse-loamy and usually occur on slightly higher positions on alluvial fans. The Dehy soils are coarse-loamy and have mollic epipedons less than 61 cm thick. They usually occur on lower positions on alluvial fans. The Mountom soils have thick organic layers and are continuously wet. They occur higher on the fan and are associated with springs."
