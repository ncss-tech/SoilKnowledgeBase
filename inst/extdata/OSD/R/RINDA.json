  "OVERVIEW": "The Rinda series consists of poorly drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess or pedisediment and the underlying gray paleosol weathered from glacial till on uplands.  These soils are very slowly permeable.  Slope ranges from 5 to 14 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is greater than 5 feet but is as thin as 3 1/2 feet in some pedons.  The depth to the layer of maximum clay content and depth to the clay paleosol decrease as slope gradient increases.  The upper 10 to 18 inches of most pedons formed in loess or silty sediments.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are typically silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon commonly is present below the A or Ap horizon in slightly eroded or uncultivated areas.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, and typically is silt loam.  The E horizon is incorporated into the Ap horizon in some pedons.  The A, Ap, and E horizons are slightly or moderately acid unless limed.\nIn most pedons there is a BE horizon of silty clay loam or silty clay with silt coatings on the faces of peds.  The BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.\nSome pedons have a Btg horizon of silty clay loam or silty clay.  The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe thickness and degree of expression in the 2Btg horizon are variable and in many places are related to geologic truncation of the original paleosol.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The BE and 2Btg horizons have redox concentrations with values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6 and redox depletions with values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The amount of reddish or brownish redox concentrations increases with depth.  The upper part of the 2Btg horizon ranges from about 45 to 55 percent clay.  Horizons with silty clay or clay textures range from 2 to 10 feet in thickness.  Sand content increases in amount and size with increasing depth.  In some pedons small pebbles are in the 2Btg  horizons.  The 2Btg horizon ranges from neutral to strongly acid.  In some pedons calcium has been replenished in the lower 2Btg horizons by seepage water from upslope or by leachate from the mantling material, so reaction of the lower part of the 2Btg horizon is quite variable.\nThe 2BCg horizon grades to a 2Cg horizon of mottled gray to brownish gray and yellowish brown clay loam glacial till."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bucknell, Gifford, Kilwinning, Kniffin, Leonard, Pershing, Shields, and Stateline series of the same family.  Bucknell soils have thinner layers of silty clay or clay paleosols.  Gifford soils have silty clay layers that formed in loess in the upper part and lower horizons that formed in alluvium that contains less clay than in the lower parts of the Rinda soils.  Kilwinning, Kniffin, and Pershing soils formed entirely in loess and have a lower clay maximum in the Bt horizon and contain less sand in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon.  In addition, they have lower bulk densities and are more permeable.  Shields soils contain rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section.  Stateline soils have slopes of 2 percent or less and have lower mean annual air temperatures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rinda soils typically are on convex side slopes and coves at the head of drainageways which dissect the nearly level or flat uplands.  They are common on the upper slopes that border the major drainage divides and typically repeat this position on the landscape from one drainage divide to another.  Slopes range from about 5 to 14 percent.  Rinda soils formed mainly in exhumed gray clayey paleosols, which were formed in glacial till, commonly of Kansan age, but in some places they formed in paleosols of Aftonian Age or accretion clay.  The upper part formed in a thin mantle of loess or silty sediments.  Soils formed in loess are upslope, and soils formed in glacial till are downslope.  Mean annual air temperature is about 50 to 54 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 to 35 inches.  The annual frost free period ranges from about 155 to 180 days.  Elevation ranges from about 650 to 1400 feet above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bucknell, Kniffin and Pershing series and the Armstrong and Gara series.  Bucknell soils formed in paleosols that have been more severely truncated than Rinda soils and are downslope from Rinda soils.  Kniffin and Pershing soils formed in loess on higher and generally less sloping positions in the landscape.  Armstrong soils formed in reddish colored Late Sangamon paleosols on slopes below the Rinda soils, and they have a stone line in the lower part of the A horizon or upper part of the B horizon.  Gara soils are downslope and formed in clay loam glacial till.  Rinda soils are in a biosequence with the Clarinda soils which formed under prairie grasses and the Ashgrove soils which formed under trees."
