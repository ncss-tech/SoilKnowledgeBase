  "OVERVIEW": "The Robinlee series consists of very deep, well drained soils on nearly level to undulating moraines.  They formed in glacial drift influenced by loess.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
