  "OVERVIEW": "The Riverrun series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, stream terraces, outwash fans and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
