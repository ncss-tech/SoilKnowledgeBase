  "OVERVIEW": "The Raynoldson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium on fan terraces and fan remnants.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and rapid below.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 22 inches and the average annual temperature is 37 degrees F.",
