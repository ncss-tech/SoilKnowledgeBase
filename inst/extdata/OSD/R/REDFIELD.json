Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and shale. The climate is semiarid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 8 to 10.5 degrees C. The mean summer temperature is 19.5 to 20.5 degrees C., and the frost free period ranges from 100 to 140 days."
