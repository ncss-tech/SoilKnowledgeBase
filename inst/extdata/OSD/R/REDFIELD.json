  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redfield series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and shale. Redfield soils occur on alluvial fans, basin floors, alluvial flats, fan skirts and valley plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
