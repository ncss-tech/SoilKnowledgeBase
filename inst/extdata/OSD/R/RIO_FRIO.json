Snail shell fragments are in all horizons.  Films and threads of calcium carbonate are evident in all horizons below the Ap horizon and increase with depth.  Total clay content ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  Carbonate clay ranges from 2 to 15 percent.  Siliceous and limestone pebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, or clay loam.  Films and threads of calcium carbonate range from none to few in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4; Texture is loam or clay loam.  In some pedons the lower part of the horizon contains up to 50 percent limestone pebbles and calcium carbonate concretions."
