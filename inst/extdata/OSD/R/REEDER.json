  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates is 8 to 36 inches.  The depth to soft sandstone, siltstone or mudstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  This horizon commonly averages between 20 and 30 percent clay, but ranges from 18 to 35 percent and from 20 to 45 percent fine sand and coarser.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has moderate or strong coarse to fine prismatic structure, or medium or fine angular or subangular blocky structure.  Peds in the Bt horizon have common or many faint clay films.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains disseminated and segregated carbonates.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 6 to 20 percent.  Segregated carbonates occurs as common or many masses or threads.\nThe Cr horizon is soft weathered sandstone, siltstone or mudstone and has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, and value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some of the layers exhibit the platiness of the original rock structure and others are massive.  Some pedons have a loam, clay loam or silty clay loam C horizon above the Cr horizon."

Bookcliff, Bullflat, Dooley, Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Felor, Greenway, Hangdo, Krem, Lefor, Livona, Martinsdale, Sponseller, Trag, Ulrant, Vida, Wemple, Williams and Yegen soils do not have soft weathered bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  In addition, Fairfield soils have a thinner solum and have a calcic horizon within a depth of 14 inches; Lefor, Livona, and Yegen soils have more sand in the control sections; and Williams soils formed in glacial till.  Gurney, Moen and Watrous soils have a lithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Lininger soils do not have carbonates in the solum.  Morton soils are fine-silty."

The soils formed in material weathered from soft, calcareous sandstone, siltstone or mudstone.  Mean annual temperature is about 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 19 inches."

Amor, Morton, Sen and Vebar soils are on the same plain as the Reeder soils.  Sen soils do not have argillic horizons, have weaker structure, and are coarse-silty.  Vebar soil are coarse-loamy.  Arnegard soils are in the concave swales and flats below the Reeder soils.  Shambo soils are in the adjacent stream valleys at lower elevations.  Flasher soils do not have mollic epipedons, have coarser textures and are on the steeper hilltops and ridges."
