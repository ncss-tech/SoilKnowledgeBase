  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is about 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The soils are above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to November 15.  The soils are saturated from a high water table most of the year and are moist at the surface from about November 15 to July 1.  The depth to mottles is 8 to 28 inches.  The soils are noncalcareous from the surface to a depth of 20 inches.  They are calcareous in some parts from a depth of 20 to 40 inches and they are either calcareous below a depth of 40 inches.  Phases that are noncalcareous throughout are also recognized.  The upper 16 to 30 inches of the profile is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is influenced by volcanic material and has a bulk density of 0.95 g/cc to 1.1 g/cc.  Below this the texture is a stratified coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, sandy clay loam and loam with 5 to 25 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 5/1, 2/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2; N 3/, 4/0, 5/.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/3; N 2/ or 1/.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Organic matter content ranges from 5 to 15 percent and decreases regularly with depth.\nThe B horizon includes the same colors as the A horizon.  It is clay or silty clay.  The lower boundary of this horizon is gradual or there is a transitional horizon.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/1, 7/2, 5/4, 6/4; 5Y 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2.  It is stratified sandy loam, loamy sand, sandy clay loam and loam with 5 to 25 percent clay in the upper part and loam, silt loam, sandy loam or their gravelly equivalents in the lower part.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ramelli soils are nearly level and are in depressional basins or valley flood plains at elevations of 4,500 to 5,300 feet.  They formed in fine textured alluvium from mixed sources including some volcanic ash and are underlain by coarser textured alluvium.  The climate is cool semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is 28 degrees F, average July temperature is 69 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 80 to 90 days."

Balman soils lack mollic epipedons and are calcareous in the upper horizons.  Beckwourth soils have an argillic horizon and have less than 35 percent clay.  Calpine soils are sandy loam and lack mottles.  Loyalton soils have a natric horizon.  Ormsby soils are sandy in all horizons."
