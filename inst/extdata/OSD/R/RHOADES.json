  "OVERVIEW": "The Rhoades series consists of deep and very deep, well or moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in stratified loamy and clayey materials derived from soft shale, siltstone or mudstone.  These soils are in swales on uplands and terraces and have slope of 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",
