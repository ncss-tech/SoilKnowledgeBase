    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft shale, siltstone or mudstone is more than 40 inches.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon.  Combined A and E horizon thickness is 1 to 5 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.  They are moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are silty clay loam, clay loam, clay or silty clay and have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand and average between 35 and 50 percent clay.  They are neutral to strongly alkaline.  They have coarse or medium columnar structure.  The columns separate to blocks in some pedons.  They are firm or very firm.  Clay films and organic stains are on faces of columns.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It has few to common gypsum crystals.  Some pedons have a By, Bk, BC or BCy horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Coarser textures are allowed below 40 inches.  It is stratified in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Cy or Cz horizon.  Some pedons do not have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon, when present, typically is massive soft shale, siltstone or mudstone.  Some pedons have a Cr horizon at depths of 40 to more than 60 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adger, Dogtooth, Exline, Ferney, Mekinock, Miranda and Scairt series as previously classified.  Adger soils have an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.  Dogtooth, Mekinock and Scairt soils have shale bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Exline soils have chroma of 1 in the A horizon and formed in lacustrine sediments.  Ferney soils have redoximorphic features, have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the particle-size control section, a udic moisture regime and formed in till.  Miranda soils formed in till and have 1 to 10 percent rock fragments throughout."

The soils formed in stratified loamy and clayey materials derived from soft shale, siltstone or mudstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches."

Belfield soils do not have visible salts or gypsum within a depth of 16 inches.  Daglum soils occur on similar positions as Rhoades soils.  Daglum soils do not have visible gypsum within depths of 16 inches.  Morton, Regent and Vebar soils are on slightly higher position than Rhoades soils on terraces and uplands.  These soils do not have do not have natric horizons."

A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 3.5 to 5.0 feet at some time during the period of April through June in the moderately well drained phase.  It is at a depth of 4 to more than 6 feet for the same period in the well drained phase."
