  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for at least half the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F, and dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay with an average of 50 percent or more.  When present, carbonates generally are only thin coatings on the bottom of cobbles and stones in the C horizon.  The solum is neutral or slightly alkaline. Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the A and upper part of the Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically loam or clay loam but ranges to silt loam and is typically very stony, but ranges from very gravelly to extremely stony.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is typically clay but ranges to clay loam in the upper part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  It averages 50 to 60 percent clay and 45 to 85 percent rock fragments.\nSome pedons over welded tuff have a thin 1 to 3 inch layer of soft weathered bedrock above the lithic contact."

Camaspatch, Flatron, Gwinly, Laufer, Lorella, Radec and Waterbury soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Longcreek, Laufer, Loomer, and Pioche soils average less than 50 percent clay as a maximum in the particle-size control section.  Vantage soils are similar and review is needed."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ruckles soils are on hill and canyon side slopes and have slopes of 0 to 80 percent.  Elevations range from 1,200 to 3,800 feet in Oregon and up to 5,500 feet in Idaho. These soils formed in colluvium from basalt and tuff.  Local accumulations of loess and volcanic ash are on the surface. The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean winter temperature ranges from 33 to 35 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days."
