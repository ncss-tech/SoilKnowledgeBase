  "OVERVIEW": "The Randsburg series consists of shallow to soft rock, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic rock. Randsburg soils are on hills and granitic rock pediments. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact is 8 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 72 degrees F.  and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.\nThe A horizon is lOYR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4 dry; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4 moist.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and fine gravel is present in volumes up to 15 percent. The A1 horizon ranges in structure from weak very fine granular to weak thin platy or it may be massive. The surface of most pedons is paved with fine gravel.\nThe Bt horizon is lOYR 6/3, 6/4 dry; 10YR 4/3, 4/4 moist. Where this horizon is lacking the A horizon rests directly on the weathered granite.\nThe Cr horizon is strongly weathered granitic rock that\nhas retained rock structure.  This weathered rock will disperse into separate minerals with soaking in water or with soaking and shaking in water.  In some pedons sufficient carbonate has not accumulated in the weathered granitic rock to form a Crk horizon.  The carbonate occurs in other pedons as thin randomly oriented seams. Some of these small seams have silica as part of the cement, and in some pedons the small discontinuous pieces of duripan are absent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

Solis soils have appreciable summer moisture in the soil profile, have strongly effervescent C horizons, and all rock fragments are always from sandstone."

Slope gradients are 2 to 50 percent.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches, most of which occurs as rain in the late autumn and winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow. Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees to 68 degrees F., average January temperature about  45 degrees F., and July temperature about 89 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."

Kimberlina and Cajon soils are very deep calcareous soils that formed in granitic alluvium on alluvial fans and on stream flood plains.  Also, Kimberlina soils have coarse-loamy particle-size families and the Cajon soils have sandy particle-size families.  Hi Vista soils have fine-loamy particle-size families and sandy clay loam Bt horizons."
