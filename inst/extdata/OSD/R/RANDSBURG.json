(0 to 9 inches thick)\nCrk--12 to 33 inches; weathered granitic rock with coatings of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) on mineral grains; carbonates segregated as filaments, soft masses, and threads; weathered rock will disperse into individual minerals with soaking in water; abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 25 inches thick)\nCrkq--33 to 48 inches; weathered gray (10YR 6/1) granitic rock; carbonates disseminated in seams and cracks that extend at an angle into the weathered rock; few pockets of silica cemented pan which are discontinuous are found in the lower part of this horizon; weathered rock will disperse into individual minerals with soaking and shaking in water."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact is 8 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 72 degrees F.  and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.\nThe A horizon is lOYR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4 dry; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4 moist.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and fine gravel is present in volumes up to 15 percent. The A1 horizon ranges in structure from weak very fine granular to weak thin platy or it may be massive. The surface of most pedons is paved with fine gravel.\nThe Bt horizon is lOYR 6/3, 6/4 dry; 10YR 4/3, 4/4 moist. Where this horizon is lacking the A horizon rests directly on the weathered granite.\nThe Cr horizon is strongly weathered granitic rock that\nhas retained rock structure.  This weathered rock will disperse into separate minerals with soaking in water or with soaking and shaking in water.  In some pedons sufficient carbonate has not accumulated in the weathered granitic rock to form a Crk horizon.  The carbonate occurs in other pedons as thin randomly oriented seams. Some of these small seams have silica as part of the cement, and in some pedons the small discontinuous pieces of duripan are absent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chinkle and Solis series. Chinkle soils have 5YR colors in the A horizon and 2.5YR colors in the subsoil, and are 20 to 30 inches to hard rock. Solis soils have appreciable summer moisture in the soil profile, have strongly effervescent C horizons, and all rock fragments are always from sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Randsburg soils are on hills and granite rock pediments.  The soils formed in residuum from granitic rocks.  Elevations are 2,375 to 3,500 feet. Slope gradients are 2 to 50 percent.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches, most of which occurs as rain in the late autumn and winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow. Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees to 68 degrees F., average January temperature about  45 degrees F., and July temperature about 89 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Muroc soils and the Kimberlina, Cajon, and Hi Vista soils.  Kimberlina and Cajon soils are very deep calcareous soils that formed in granitic alluvium on alluvial fans and on stream flood plains.  Also, Kimberlina soils have coarse-loamy particle-size families and the Cajon soils have sandy particle-size families.  Hi Vista soils have fine-loamy particle-size families and sandy clay loam Bt horizons."
