  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ratliff series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy, calcareous eolian deposits of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. They are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
