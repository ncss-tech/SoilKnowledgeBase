    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In older surveys, Roval soils were formerly classified as Brown soils and later classified as Argiduridic Durixerolls. The type location was moved and the soil reclassified in 2009 to better reflect the soil characteristics of the landscape.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 5 cm (A horizon).\nArgillic Horizon - The zone from 5 to 44 cm (Bt and Btk horizons).\nDuripan - The zone from 44 to 110 cm (2Bqkm1 and 2Bqkm2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section- The zone from 5 to 44 cm (Bt and Btk horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Additional Authors: HJB/LNL/ELS.\nPedon ID number: 2009NV017003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
