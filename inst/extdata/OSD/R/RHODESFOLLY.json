All horizons have a pH of neutral through strongly alkaline and an oxidized pH of very strongly acid through slightly alkaline. Soil has a 5:1 salinity greater than 0.6 dS/m throughout the profile. Rock fragments are predominately fine gravel or shell fragments and are less than 35 percent (by volume) in all layers within the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10Y or is neutral, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand through coarse sand. It is massive or single grain. Gravel content is 0 through 10 percent. Shell fragment content is 0 through 10 percent. Consistence is nonfluid.\nSome pedons have an ACg horizon with characteristics similar to the A horizon. It is 0 to 43 cm thick.\nSome pedons have a CAg or C/A horizon with hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture ranges from sandy loam through sand. It is massive or single grain. Gravel content is 0 through 5 percent. Consistence is nonfluid. It is 0 to 29 cm thick.\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, 10Y, or is neutral, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sand, mucky sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or single grain. Gravel content is 0 through 34 percent. Shell fragment content is 0 through 34 percent. Herbaceous fibers are 0 through 10 percent unrubbed and 0 through 5 percent rubbed. Consistence is nonfluid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y, 10Y, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 2.5 through 5 and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture ranges from loamy sand through coarse sand in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or single grain. Gravel content is 0 through 20 percent. Shell fragment content is 0 through 34 percent.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rhodesfolly soils are permanently submerged with strongly saline water on unstable bay bottoms, shore faces and washover fans that are sandy. Slope ranges from 0 through 5 percent. The soils formed in sandy deposits with numerous buried horizons from catastrophic storm events that breeched the barrier island or spit. The shore face and washover fan landforms are nearly level through gently sloping with steeper edges leading into deeper waters. The soil is subject to depositional change due to severe storm events. Wave action and strong currents influence the formation of these soils."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Peraquic moisture regime - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 126 cm of salt water at the time of coring).\n2. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 cm (Ag horizon).\n3. Aquic conditions - continuous saturation and reduction in the zone from 0 to 150 cm.\n4. Fluventic feature - irregular decrease in organic carbon content in the zone from 20 to 92 cm (the Ab, A'b, A''b1, and A''b2 horizons).\n5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (Ab, C'g1, C'g2, A'b, C''g, A''b1, A''b2, and C'''g horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon, S05RI0009007 and additional pedon data, S05RI0009008 analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE.
