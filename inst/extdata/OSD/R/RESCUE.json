  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 30 to 70 inches thick. Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 40 to 80 inches. Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F.  Coarse fragments in the profile range from about 3 to 25 percent. The larger amounts are in the upper A horizon or in the C horizon. Between the depths of about 5 and 15 inches the soils are usually continually moist but become dry in May or early June and remain dry all the time until sometime in October or early November. The soils are usually slightly or moderately acid throughout, but are neutral in the lower part of some pedons.\nThe A horizon is reddish brown or brown in hue of 7.5YR or 5YR. Moist chromas are 4 or more below a depth of 4 inches, or are 4 or more in all parts. It has 3 to 8 percent organic matter in the upper 4 inches and drops to levels of 0.5 to 1.5 percent at a depth of 10 inches. It is sandy loam or loam. Its lower boundary is gradual or there is either one or both an A3 horizon and a Bl horizon.\nThe B2t horizon is red, reddish brown, yellowish red or reddish yellow in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. It is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and has 10 to 20 percent total coarse and very coarse sand.  It averages 75 to 85 percent base saturation."

Burchell, Jacinto, Marguerite, Pachappa and Wyo soils have no hue redder than 10YR, and Los Robles, Honn, Modesto and Pleasanton soils have no hue redder than 7.5YR in the B2t horizon. Blasingame soils have less than 1 percent organic matter in all parts of the A horizon. Cajalco and Trimmer soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches. Coarsegold soils have less than 10 percent coarse and very coarse sand and are micaceous. Ojai soils have very hard dry consistence in the A1 horizon.  Perkins soils have B2t horizons that are gravelly in the upper part and very gravelly in the lower part. Sobrante soils have a lithic contact above 40 inches. Whitney soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches and no hue redder than 7.5YR."
