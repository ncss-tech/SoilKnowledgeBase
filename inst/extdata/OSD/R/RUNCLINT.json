    "content": "REMARKS:\n1. This soil was formerly included in the Evesboro series.\n2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of  28 cm (11 inches) (Oi and Ap horizons).\nb. Redoximorphic features Mottles due to wetness in the zone between 155 to 188 cm (61 and 74 inches) (C horizon).                                                                                                                                                                        c. Lamellae: thin bands of yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loamy sand in the zone from 124 to 155 cm (49 to 61 inches) (E & Bt horizon).                                                                                    3. This soil has a Bw horizon because of high chroma and reddish hue (5YR 5/8) from 61 to 107 cm (24 to 42 inches).  It is not a cambic horizon because the texture is not very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or finer than these textures.                                                                                                                     4. The 11/2005 revision reclassifies Runclint from mesic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments to mesic, coated Lamellic Quartzipsamments per 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2003.                                                  5. Some pedons in wooded areas may have a micro sequence of A-E-Bh horizons (micro-podzol). Total thickness of the A-E-Bh horizon sequence is less than 12.5 cm (5 inches) and individual horizons are less than 2.5 cm (1 inch) thick.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This series sampled as S85MD-019-009; S97MD-045-017.
