The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to gravel is more than 60 inches and the solum is 40 to 60 inches thick.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  Organic carbon decreases regularly with increasing depth and the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist to a depth of 20 inches or more and 3 or 4 below 20 inches.  Value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam, averaging 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe lower part of the solum and C horizon are stratified in some pedons.\nFaint redoximorphic features are below depth of 40 inches in some pedons."
